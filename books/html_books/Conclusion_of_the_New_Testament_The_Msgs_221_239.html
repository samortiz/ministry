THE FAILURES IN THE CHURCHES</h2><p>In the Bible there is a record not only of the positive things concerning the church but also a record of the failures in the churches. There are no failures in the universal church; however, there are failures in the local churches. All the failures come out of one source, and this source is Satan, who instigates the weak saints to cause all kinds of local problems. The universal church is heavenly, holy, and even divine. But when the universal church reaches a certain locality to be expressed in a local church, the church in that locality may become contaminated and polluted by certain local customs, practices, and philosophies. Therefore, the failures are not in the universal church but in the local churches which have been contaminated by the things of their localities. For this reason, in the New Testament there is not only a clear vision of the pure, holy, heavenly, and divine church but also a record of all the failures in the local churches.<h2 class=head2>A. Hypocrisy</h2><p>The first failure in the churches was that of hypocrisy seen in the case of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11). Hypocrisy is a matter of pretending to be somebody in order to get a name that we may have vainglory. This is altogether related to ambition. Ambition, therefore, is the seed of the failures in the churches. We all should condemn ambition and not seek to get a name for ourselves in order to have vainglory.<p>Ananias and his wife Sapphira were seeking a position. They wanted to be somebody and to have a name so that they could enjoy vainglory. This was the cause of their hypocrisy. They did not offer everything to the church for the Lord&#8217;s sake but pretended to do this. As a result, although they were saved persons, they were condemned and suffered physical death.<h2 class=head3>1. Letting Satan Fill the Heart</h2><p>Acts 5:1-11 indicates that two persons were making their residence in Ananias and Sapphira. First, the Spirit was no doubt dwelling in them. Because they were saved, the Holy Spirit had taken up His residence within them. Second, Satan was dwelling in them, for he had filled their hearts to lie to the Spirit (v. 3). Satan was not merely outside them but was in their hearts deceiving them and seducing them.<p>How could Satan have such ground within Ananias and Sapphira? Satan had this ground because of their ambition. The ground in Ananias and Sapphira that was the basis for Satan&#8217;s deception of them was their desire to have a name. They wanted to have the reputation of having sold everything for the church. Because of their ambition, they formed a plan. They sold a piece of property, kept some of the proceeds for themselves, and then brought a certain part and laid it at the feet of the apostles.<p>Satan is not far from us, and we need to be careful lest we be deceived by him. If we would avoid Satan&#8217;s deception, we must reject, condemn, and abandon the position to be somebody in the church life. Whenever we have the thought of being somebody in the church life, Satan has the ground to deceive us.<p>Ananias and Sapphira had the ambition to be somebody in the church; they had the ambition to have a name. Because of their ambition they were deceived, and that deception brought them into death. As the record indicates, both Ananias and Sapphira died physically.<h2 class=head3>2. Lying to and Testing the Holy Spirit-God</h2><p>Acts 5:4 indicates that selling possessions and distributing them to others was not considered by the apostles a practice of legality. The believers were not required to have all things common. That was something that should have been done willingly. If Ananias and Sapphira did not want to sell their property, they were not required to do so. Furthermore, the money from the sale was in their own authority. It would not have been sinful for them to keep their property or to keep the proceeds from the sale of the property. Their sin consisted in lying to the Holy Spirit. Their intention was to cheat the church and to get a name for themselves by lying. This was a gross sin that offended the indwelling Spirit. Their sin was a willing cooperation with Satan, the evil resident within them.<p>In 5:3 Peter told Ananias that he lied to the Holy Spirit. Then at the end of verse 4 Peter said to him, &#8220;You did not lie to men, but to God.&#8221; This proves that the Holy Spirit in verse 3 is God.<p>Later, when Peter was speaking to Sapphira, he said to her, &#8220;Why was it agreed together by you to test the Spirit of the Lord?&#8221; (v. 9). The Holy Spirit in verse 3, God in verse 4, and the Lord in verse 9 are all one, especially in the experience of the believers.<p>We should not think that the Spirit to whom Ananias and Sapphira lied was the Spirit in the heavens, the Spirit outside them. They did not lie merely to an objective Spirit; they lied to the very Spirit who was within them. If the Holy Spirit had not been within them, Peter would not have said that they had lied to the Holy Spirit. Both Satan and the Holy Spirit resided in Ananias and Sapphira at the same time.<p>The fact that Ananias and Sapphira suffered the punishment of physical death for lying to the Holy Spirit does not mean that they will suffer eternal perdition. Although Ananias and Sapphira were saved, they committed a sin unto death (1 John 5:16-17). In God&#8217;s governmental dealing, some of His children may be destined to physical death in this age due to a certain sin. This was the situation of Ananias and Sapphira, who were punished with physical death because of their lying to the Holy Spirit. Their case teaches us to be extremely careful about ambition and dishonesty in the church life.<h2 class=head3>3. Pretending to Be Absolute for the Lord</h2><p>Ananias and Sapphira pretended to be absolute for the Lord (vv. 3b-4a, 8). They pretended to give everything to the church. This was their hypocrisy, which was due to their ambition to be somebody and to have a name for vainglory.<h2 class=head2>B. Being Overcome by Racial Difference</h2><p>The second failure in the churches was the failure of being overcome by racial difference. Acts 6:1 says, &#8220;In these days, when the disciples were multiplying, there was a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were overlooked in the daily dispensing.&#8221; The Hellenists were Jews who spoke Greek, and the Hebrews were Jews who spoke Hebrew. At the very beginning of the practice of the church life, there was a failure that seemed to be caused by different languages. Apparently the problem in the church at Jerusalem was a problem of language related to those who spoke Hebrew and those who spoke Greek. Actually, this was a problem not mainly of language but of race.<p>We know from Acts 2 that Jews had come from their dispersion to Jerusalem to keep the feast of Pentecost. Those who had been dispersed among other races gradually came to speak the languages of those races. Thus, when they came to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of Pentecost, they were not able to speak Hebrew but spoke their native languages. In particular, the Hellenists spoke Greek. The difference of language became a problem. Actually, the source of the trouble was not language but race. If all of mankind were of one race, there would probably be just one language. Different languages are the result of different races. According to Genesis 11, the source of this problem was Babel.<p>Since the time of Babel, mankind has been divided into different races that have formed their own nations and kingdoms. This division is the basic problem of the human race. According to Ephesians 2, the Lord Jesus on the cross abolished all the ordinances among the races. Nevertheless, the church at Jerusalem suffered from racial differences.<h2 class=head3>1. In the Matter of Eating</h2><p>Acts 6:1 tells us that there was a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were overlooked in the daily dispensing. This indicates that the failure in being overcome by racial differences was in the matter of eating.<h2 class=head3>2. Causing the Practice of Having All Things Common to Wane</h2><p>The problem in Acts 6 in the matter of eating caused the practice of having all things common (Acts 2:44-45) to wane. Eventually, that practice was discontinued because it did not work well. The reason the practice of having all things common did not work well was mainly the racial difference. The Hellenistic Jews were somehow despised and mistreated by the typical Jews. As a result, there was murmuring concerning the daily dispensing. This led to the waning of the practice of having all things common.<h2 class=head2>C. Bringing In the Legal Practices of the Old Testament</h2><p>Another failure was that of bringing in the legal practices of the Old Testament (Acts 15:1-2). This damaged the church life in the first century during the lifetime of the first group of apostles.<p>Acts 15:1 says, &#8220;Certain men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.&#8221; The men who came down from Judea had a strong purpose to exercise Judaic influence on the Gentile believers. The claim that unless one is circumcised according to the custom of Moses he cannot be saved is an annulling of the faith in God&#8217;s New Testament economy, and it is a real heresy.<p>Circumcision, Sabbath-keeping, and a particular diet are the three strongest ordinances according to the law of Moses that caused the Jews to be distinct and separate from the Gentiles, who are regarded by them as unclean. All these scriptural ordinances of the Old Testament dispensation became an obstacle to the spreading of the gospel to the Gentiles according to God&#8217;s New Testament dispensation (Col. 2:16). Acts 15:1 speaks of the custom of Moses. To keep the custom of Moses, that is, to practice the outward ordinances of the law, is not only to nullify the grace of God and make Christ&#8217;s death of no effect (Gal. 2:21), but also to bring the believers, whom Christ has set free, back to the slavery of law (Gal. 5:1; 2:4).<h2 class=head3>1. Circumcision on the Flesh</h2><p>Circumcision was an outward ordinance inherited by the Jews from their forefathers, beginning from Abraham (Gen. 17:9-14). This ordinance made the Jews distinct and separate from the Gentiles. Circumcision became a dead, traditional formality, a mere mark on the flesh without any spiritual significance, and it became a great obstacle to the spread of God&#8217;s gospel according to His New Testament economy (Gal. 2:3-4; 6:12-13; Phil. 3:2). To be circumcised in God&#8217;s New Testament economy is to make Christ of no profit to the believers (Gal. 5:2).<p>The teaching that one must be circumcised in order to be saved annuls Christ&#8217;s redemption, God&#8217;s grace, and the entire New Testament economy of God. Therefore, in Acts 15 Paul and Barnabas could not tolerate this heresy, and they &#8220;had no little dissension and discussion&#8221; (v. 2) with those who had come down from Judea and taught it to the Christian brothers. Here Paul and Barnabas were contending for the faith (Jude 3) against one of the greatest heresies so that the truth of the gospel might remain with the believers (Gal. 2:5).<p>In Philippians 3:2 Paul uses the word &#8220;concision,&#8221; meaning &#8220;mutilation&#8221;; it is a contemptuous term for circumcision. Originally the word &#8220;circumcision&#8221; was a term of honor among Jews. But when the Apostle Paul wrote the Epistle to the Philippians, fleshly circumcision was no longer honorable but dishonorable. Therefore, he used the word concision, a term of despite.<p>In Philippians 3:2 Paul was very bold, saying, &#8220;Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision.&#8221; Since there is no conjunction used in this verse between these three clauses, they must refer to the same class of people. Dogs are unclean (Lev. 11:4-8), the workers are evil, and the concision are those deserving contempt. The &#8220;dogs&#8221; refer to the Judaizers. In nature they are unclean dogs, in behavior they are evil workers, and in religion they are the concision, people of shame. Paul certainly is very strong in charging the Philippians to beware of the dogs, the evil workers, the concision. Here Paul is saying that the Judaizers, those who promote circumcision, are dogs.<h2 class=head3>2. Annulling the Freedom in Christ</h2><p>The legal practices of the Old Testament annul the believers&#8217; freedom in Christ. In Galatians 2:3 and 4 Paul says, &#8220;Not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. And it was because of the false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into slavery.&#8221; The false brothers were the Judaizers who perverted the gospel of Christ by smuggling the ordinances of the law into the church. The freedom Paul speaks of here is freedom from the bondage of the law. Slavery here refers to slavery under the law.<p>The false brothers to whom Paul refused to be subject (v. 5) were spreading the concept that the believers had to be circumcised in order to be saved. Paul stood against this and did not yield even for an hour. He would not be subject to those who sought to damage our freedom in Christ and to bring us into slavery. To be free in Christ is to enjoy liberation from the bondage of the law with its requirement of circumcision. All the believers are now free from obligation to the law, especially from the obligation to be circumcised. In order to maintain this freedom, Paul refused to have Titus circumcised or to yield in subjection to the Judaizers.<h2 class=head3>3. Even Causing Peter to Play Hypocrisy, the Rest of the Jewish Believers Who Were with Him to Join Him in Hypocrisy, and Even Barnabas to Be Carried Away by Their Hypocrisy</h2><p>In Galatians 2:12 and 13 Paul, referring to Peter, says, &#8220;Before some came from James, he ate with those of the nations; but when they came, he shrank back and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.&#8221; The fact that Peter shrank back proves that he was very weak in the pure Christian faith. He had received an exceedingly clear vision from the heavens concerning fellowship with the Gentiles, and he took the lead to put that vision into practice in Acts10. But here, out of fear of those of the circumcision, Peter backslid to shrink from eating with the Gentile believers. Paul specifically points out that Peter feared those of the circumcision.<p>In verse 13 Paul says, &#8220;The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy.&#8221; When Peter, the leading one, backslid, the rest easily followed. It is almost incredible that Peter, the leading apostle, practiced hypocrisy in relation to the truth of the gospel.<p>In verse 13 Paul points out that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy. Barnabas participated in Paul&#8217;s first journey to preach the gospel to the Gentiles and to raise up the Gentile churches. Even one who had so much fellowship with the Gentile believers was carried away by Peter&#8217;s hypocrisy.<h2 class=head2>D. Compromising with Judaism</h2><p>A very serious failure in the churches was the failure of compromising with Judaism (Acts 21:20-26). The Apostle James, a brother in the flesh of the Lord Jesus, was highly regarded for his piety. However, he took the lead to compromise the church with Judaism. This is recorded in Acts 21, which speaks of Paul&#8217;s last visit to Jerusalem. Paul went to Jerusalem with the intention of doing something to clear up the compromising situation there.<p>As Acts 21:20 indicates, James did not give Paul the opportunity to do anything. Although James and the other elders in Jerusalem glorified God for what He had done among the Gentiles through Paul&#8217;s ministry, they nevertheless said to him, &#8220;You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous for the law&#8221; (v. 20). This word indicates how the Jewish believers in Jerusalem still kept the law of Moses, still remained in the Old Testament dispensation, and still were strongly under the Judaic influence, mixing God&#8217;s New Testament economy with the out-of-date economy of the Old Testament.<p>Referring to the thousands of Jews who believed and were zealous for the law, James went on to say to Paul, &#8220;They have been instructed concerning you that you are teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs&#8221; (v. 21). To leave the law of Moses, not to circumcise, and not to walk according to the customs of dead letters are really according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy. But these were considered by the unbelieving Jews and even by the Jewish believers in Christ to be apostasy from God&#8217;s Old Testament dispensation. But it certainly is not apostasy to put aside the Old Testament economy.<p>In 21:23b-24 we have the requirement James and the other elders made of Paul. &#8220;Four men are with us who have a vow on themselves; take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things of which they have been instructed concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law.&#8221; The vow mentioned in verse 23 was the Nazarite vow (Num. 6:2-5). For Paul to be purified with the Nazarites was to become a Nazarite with them, joining them in their vow. To take the Nazarite vow is a purification before God.<p>In addition to telling Paul to be purified with the four who had a vow on themselves, they told him to pay their expenses so that they might shave their heads. Paying their expenses refers to the cost of the offerings which a Nazarite had to pay for the completion of his purification (Num. 6:13-17).<p>Acts 21:26 says, &#8220;Then Paul took the men on the following day, and having been purified with them entered into the temple, giving notice of the completion of the days of the purification, until the offering was offered for each one of them.&#8221; Here we see that Paul participated in their Nazarite vow. In order to do this, Paul had to enter into the temple and remain there with the Nazarites until the completion of the seven days of the vow. Then the priest would offer the offerings for each one of them, including him. Paul surely was clear that such a practice was of the out-of-date dispensation, which, according to the principle of his teaching in the New Testament ministry, should be repudiated in God&#8217;s New Testament economy. Yet he went through with it, probably because of his Jewish background and because he was practicing his word in 1 Corinthians 9:20. However, his toleration jeopardized God&#8217;s New Testament economy, and this God would not tolerate.<h2 class=head3>1. Bringing in the Mixture of Judaism with God&#8217;s Pure Grace</h2><p>The compromise with Judaism brought in the mixture of Judaism with God&#8217;s pure grace. In chapter twenty-one of Acts we see that James and the elders in Jerusalem had formed a mixture of God&#8217;s New Testament economy with the Old Testament dispensation. Actually James and the elders were even promoting this mixture. Of course, they did not neglect faith in Christ, but they were still zealous for the Old Testament. As a result, there was a religious mixture in Jerusalem.<h2 class=head3>2. Spoiling the Purity of the Church Life</h2><p>This mixture spoiled the purity of the church life. The Jewish believers in Jerusalem had two practices: the old Judaic practice of Judaism and the practice of the semi-church life. Because of the compromise with Judaism, the purity of the church life was spoiled.<h2 class=head3>3. Damaging the Pure Testimony of Jesus Christ as the Embodiment of God&#8217;s Pure Grace</h2><p>The compromise with Judaism damaged the pure testimony of Jesus Christ as the embodiment of God&#8217;s pure grace (John 1:17). The Lord Jesus came as the embodiment of the Triune God for men to receive Him as the all-inclusive grace which is sufficient to meet man&#8217;s need in every way. To compromise God&#8217;s grace of God&#8217;s New Testament economy with the keeping of any ordinance of the law of the Old Testament dispensation is a mixture of God&#8217;s grace with man&#8217;s work that nullifies the effect of all the Lord Jesus is and does for us. This was a trouble that transpired in the church at Jerusalem under James&#8217; leadership.<h2 class=head3>4. Resulting in the Termination of the Church, Polluted with the Satanic Mixture, by the Judgment of God through the Destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman Army under Titus in A.D. 70</h2><p>The mixture of Judaic practices with God&#8217;s New Testament economy was not only erroneous in God&#8217;s dispensation but also abominable in the eyes of God. This gross mixture was terminated by God a mere ten years or so later in A.D. 70 with the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, the center of Judaism, through Titus and his Roman army. This rescued the church and absolutely separated it from the devastation of Judaism.<p>Paul was God&#8217;s chosen vessel not only for the completion of His New Testament revelation (Col. 1:25) but also for the carrying out of His New Testament economy (Eph. 3:2, 7-8). God would not allow such a vessel to participate in the Nazarite vow, a serious Judaic practice. Paul might have intended in going to Jerusalem to clear up the Judaic influence on the church there, but God knew that it was incurable. Hence, in His sovereignty He allowed Paul to be arrested by the Jews and imprisoned by the Romans so that he might write his last eight Epistles, which completed the divine revelation and gave the church a clearer and deeper view concerning God&#8217;s New Testament economy (Eph. 3:3-4). Thus, God left the Judaic-influenced church in Jerusalem to remain as it was until the devastating mixture was terminated with the destruction of Jerusalem.<p>Because of the compromise with Judaism, the church in Jerusalem was polluted with a satanic mixture. Because this was intolerable, the church there was terminated by the judgment of God through the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman army under Titus in A.D. 70. That destruction was a fulfillment of the Lord&#8217;s prophecy in Matthew 24. Along with the temple, the entire city of Jerusalem was leveled. That was the judgment God exercised upon rebellious Israel and also upon the compromising church. This judgment indicates that God will not allow His church to have any compromise. The church must be a pure golden lampstand without any dross or mixture. Once the church has mixture because of compromise, the church is polluted. God will terminate such a church. The church in Jerusalem was terminated so that its satanic mixture would no longer have any influence upon the believers.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE FAILURES IN THE CHURCHES</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider further the failures in the churches.<h2 class=head2>E. Judging One Another in the Matters of Eating and Observing of Days</h2><p>In Romans 14 Paul refers to the failure of the believers in judging one another in the matters of eating and observing days. This failure was due to certain traditional customs. Some said that the believers should eat only certain things and should observe particular days, whereas others said that they could eat everything and did not have to observe any days. As a result, there were criticism and debate concerning eating and the keeping of days.<p>In 14:2-5 Paul says, &#8220;One believes that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables. Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him. Who are you that judges another&#8217;s household servant? To his own lord he will stand or fall. But he will be made to stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. One judges one day above another, another judges every day alike. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind.&#8221; Here Paul is an excellent example of not judging others in the matters of eating and observing days, for he did not express his opinion about which is right or wrong. Certainly he knew the correct doctrines about eating and about the keeping of days. Nevertheless, he did not take sides but charged the believers to be general and not to criticize others. We should let others be free to eat whatever they want and to keep whatever day they want.<p>In 14:10 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.&#8221; Here we see that we must receive the saints in the light of the judgment seat. We should not judge others, for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.<p>In 14:20 Paul says, &#8220;Do not break down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but it is evil for a man to eat so as to be a stumbling block.&#8221; In all saved persons there is an amount of God&#8217;s work. God has called and saved them. God has done at least this much divine work in them. If we cause any one of the believers to stumble by our doctrinal concepts, we break down, destroy, God&#8217;s work of grace in him. We should take care of God&#8217;s work, not our doctrinal concepts. All our judgments concerning eating and the keeping of days must be cast aside for the sake of God&#8217;s work of grace in others. We must take care of the building up of the believers in life, not our concepts concerning eating and the keeping of days.<h2 class=head2>F. Making Divisions and Causes of Falling Contrary to the Teaching of the Apostles</h2><p>In Romans 16:17 Paul says, &#8220;Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.&#8221; Even when Paul wrote the book of Romans, some were making divisions and causes of falling contrary to &#8220;the teaching,&#8221; that is, contrary to the teaching of the apostles. If we deviate from the teachings of the apostles, we shall be factors of division and also causes of falling.<p>While we are enjoying the church life, we must be watchful for those who cause divisions. Any dissension contrary to the apostles&#8217; teaching is divisive, and we must keep a watchful, discerning eye over it. According to Romans 16:17, we must turn away from those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching of the apostles.<p>In 1 Timothy 6:3 Paul refers to anyone who &#8220;teaches differently and does not consent to healthy words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which is according to godliness.&#8221; To teach differently is to teach things that differ from the apostles&#8217; teaching centered on Christ and the church. The &#8220;healthy words&#8221; here refer to the health of life. The sound teaching of the apostles ministers healthy teaching as the supply of life to people. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ are words of life (John 6:63); hence, they are healthy words. The healthy words of the Lord are the source of the teaching according to godliness. When the Lord&#8217;s words of life are taught, particularly in certain aspects, they become the teaching according to godliness. The living words of the Lord always bring forth godliness-a life that lives Christ and expresses God in Christ. Paul&#8217;s teaching was according to godliness. However, because some did not consent to healthy words, they taught differently. They did not teach according to godliness. All our teaching must be according to the healthy words of God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head2>G. Being Puffed Up on Behalf of One Gifted Person against Another unto Strife and Divisions</h2><p>A failure among the believers at Corinth was that they were puffed up on behalf of one gifted person against another unto strife and divisions. For example, one was puffed up on behalf of Apollos against Paul and Peter, and others were puffed up on behalf of Peter against Paul and Apollos and of Paul against Peter and Apollos. The result was strife and division. Paul clearly refers to this in 1 Corinthians 1:11 and 12. &#8220;It was made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you. Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.&#8221; From this failure at Corinth we learn that it is crucial for us not to have preferences. We should not prefer one gifted person to another or one elder to another. All such preferences must be condemned. We need to learn not to have any choice or preference other than Christ. The all-inclusive Christ is our unique choice and preference. Christ is unique and undivided (1 Cor. 1:13). If we take Christ as the unique center, all divisions will be terminated.<p>In 1 Corinthians 3:3 and 4 Paul says, &#8220;You are still fleshly. For whereas there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and walking according to man? For whenever one says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not men?&#8221; Jealousy and strife are expressions, characteristics, of the nature of the flesh. Hence, they characterize those who are in the flesh, those who are fleshly. In verse 4 &#8220;men&#8221; refers to men of the flesh, to fallen, natural men. In saying that they were of Paul or of Apollos, the Corinthians were walking according to the fallen, natural man. They were not living and behaving according to the Spirit in their regenerated human spirit.<p>First Corinthians 4:6 says, &#8220;Now these things, brothers, I have applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to go beyond what has been written, that no one be puffed up on behalf of the one against the other.&#8221; By &#8220;these things&#8221; Paul refers to all that he has written previously in this Epistle. The Greek word translated &#8220;applied&#8221; literally means transfigured, transferred in a figure. What Paul has written in this Epistle gives a figure, and now he transfers that figure to himself and Apollos, applying it figuratively to himself and Apollos. Paul and Apollos are simply ministers of Christ, a planter and a waterer (3:5-7). They are not Christ crucified for the believers, and they are not God, who makes the believers grow. They should not be appraised beyond being ministers of Christ. Otherwise, their appraisers, like the fleshly Corinthian believers, may be puffed up on behalf of the one against the other.<h2 class=head2>H. Committing Fornication</h2><p>First Corinthians 5:1 says, &#8220;It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication which is not even among the nations, that someone has his father&#8217;s wife.&#8221; Here we read of a brother in the church at Corinth who had committed the sin of incest with his stepmother. Paul&#8217;s intention, of course, was to help the church to deal with this evil brother. If we did not have this record in the New Testament, it probably would be very difficult for us to believe that a saved person could commit this kind of sin. Instead, we may think that after a person has been saved he could never be this sinful. However, this chapter reveals that even a genuine believer can commit a gross sin. A brother at Corinth committed incest with his stepmother. No sin is worse or more damaging to humanity than incest. Nevertheless, this sin was committed by a brother in the church at Corinth.<h2 class=head2>I. Having Lawsuits One against Another</h2><p>We read of another failure in the churches in 1 Corinthians 6:6. &#8220;Brother goes to law with brother, and this before unbelievers.&#8221; Paul fully disagreed with this and regarded it as a defeat (vv. 4-7).<p>Going to secular law and filing a lawsuit against a brother is a matter of claiming our rights and of not being willing to suffer loss. When we are soulish and fleshly, we shall always claim our rights. We shall not be willing to be wronged by anyone. Only when we live in the spirit are we willing to give in and not insist on our rights. When we live a life by the mingled spirit, we shall not claim any rights for ourselves. The reason we claim our rights is that instead of living by the mingled spirit, we live in the soul and in the flesh. Because the soulish life was prevailing and because the door was opened through the lusts of the flesh, there were lawsuits among the believers in Corinth. The sequence is that first we have a soulish preference, then the lust of the flesh, and then the claiming of our rights.<h2 class=head2>J. Questioning the Apostle&#8217;s Apostleship and Charging the Apostle with Being Crafty in Making Gain with Guile</h2><p>The Corinthian believers also had the great failure of questioning Paul&#8217;s apostleship and even charging the apostle with being crafty in making gain with guile (1 Cor. 9:1-3; 2 Cor. 12:16). In 1 Corinthians 9:1 Paul vindicates his apostleship. He asks, &#8220;Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?&#8221; Paul&#8217;s apostleship gives him authority to deal with all the problems in Corinth, serious problems concerning the church life and its fellowship. His handling of them is based not only on his teaching but also on the authority inherent in his apostleship. To deal with the situation, Paul must take this standing and make this matter clear to the Corinthian believers. They had questioned his apostleship and were in a chaotic situation, mostly due to the foolishness of their worldly wisdom, self-confidence, and pride.<p>In verse 3 Paul says, &#8220;My defense to those who examine me is this.&#8221; The Corinthians were actually examining Paul; they were investigating him to determine whether or not he was an apostle. What a shame this was to them! This is just like children examining their father to see if he is a genuine father.<p>In 2 Corinthians 12:16 Paul says, &#8220;I did not burden you, but being crafty I took you with guile.&#8221; This is what some Corinthians charged against the apostle. They said he was crafty in making gain, indemnifying himself by sending Titus to receive the collection for the poor saints. Although Paul did not burden the Corinthians, some of them were saying that he was crafty and took them with guile. They said that Paul would not come himself but used Titus as a cover to indemnify himself while he hid behind the scene. They were accusing Paul of being the one who actually collected the money through Titus. In their judgment, that was Paul&#8217;s craftiness. Therefore, Paul sent more than one person with Titus to collect the money. He did this in order to silence the defaming tongues. However, even though Paul acted carefully and with forethought, some of the Corinthians still defamed him.<p>We learn from Paul&#8217;s experience that even though the saints may be honest, Satan is nonetheless crouching among them. Satan uses money to damage the situation between the ministering ones and the saints. This was the reason some of the Corinthians criticized Paul, accusing him of being crafty in money matters. Those who criticized Paul might have been greedy and lovers of money. This might have been the reason they accused Paul of being crafty.<h2 class=head2>K. Partaking of the Table of the Lord and of the Table of the Demons</h2><p>First Corinthians 10:21 says, &#8220;You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and of the table of demons.&#8221; To drink the cup of the Lord and partake (eat) of the table of the Lord is to identify ourselves with the Lord. To drink the cup of demons and partake of the table of demons is to make ourselves one with demons. Some of the Corinthian believers were doing this very thing through eating sacrifices to idols.<p>An idol and a sacrifice to an idol are nothing (1 Cor. 10:19; 8:4), but behind them are the demons, who are abominable and hateful to God. The believers who worship God should abstain from identifying themselves with demons and becoming worshippers of demons through eating sacrifices to idols. Since demons are the reality of idols, so eating of sacrifices to idols makes the eaters their fellowshippers, their joint participants. The eaters of sacrifices to idols become not only fellowshippers with demons but also joint participants of demons, making themselves one with demons.<p>The Lord is a jealous God (Exo. 20:5). Idolatry is utterly abominable and hateful to Him. If we participate in fellowship with demons, making ourselves one with them, we will provoke the Lord to jealousy (1 Cor. 10:22). Hence, we must flee from idolatry (1 Cor. 10:14).<h2 class=head2>L. Eating the Bread and Drinking the Cup of the Lord in an Unworthy Manner and Not Discerning the Body</h2><p>Among the Corinthians was also the failure of eating the bread and drinking the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner and not discerning the Body. First Corinthians 11:27 says, &#8220;Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.&#8221; This is not to evaluate the significance of the bread and cup of the Lord, which signify His body broken for us and His blood shed for our sins through His death for our redemption. To be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord is for a believer to bring judgment to himself (vv. 29-30).<p>In verse 29 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;For he who is eating and drinking, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the body.&#8221; To eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner brings judgment to us. This judgment is not a condemnation but the Lord&#8217;s temporary discipline (v. 32).<p>Not to discern means not to distinguish, separate, discriminate, make a distinction. To fail to discern the Lord&#8217;s body is to fail to make a distinction between the bread, which signifies the Lord&#8217;s body, and common food. It is to fail to evaluate the significance of the bread we take at the Lord&#8217;s supper.<p>Paul&#8217;s thought in using the expression &#8220;the body&#8221; may include also the mystical Body of Christ (Eph. 4:4) in addition to the physical body of the Lord (1 Cor. 11:24). Therefore, when we participate in the Lord&#8217;s table, we must discern whether the bread on the table signifies the one Body of Christ or any division of man, any denomination. In discerning the Body of Christ we should not partake of the bread in any division or with a divisive spirit. Our participation in the Lord&#8217;s table must be the unique fellowship of His unique Body without any division either in practice or in spirit.<h2 class=head2>M. Abusing the Gift of Tongue-speaking</h2><p>Another failure is that of abusing the gift of tongue-speaking (1 Cor. 14:19-20, 23). Much of today&#8217;s tongue-speaking is not genuine. But even the genuine gift of tongue-speaking should not be abused; that is, it should not be used too much in the church meetings. Paul restricted the use of the gift of tongue-speaking in the meetings, saying, &#8220;In the church I would rather speak five words with my mind that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue&#8221; (v. 19). This shows that speaking in intelligible words for the building up of the church, and not tongue-speaking, is needed in the church meetings.<p>First Corinthians 14:23 says, &#8220;If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak in tongues, and the unlearned or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are insane?&#8221; Here the word &#8220;all&#8221; refers to all the functioning ones, not all the attendants in the meeting. If in a meeting all the functioning ones speak in tongues, people may consider they are mad. Hence, to encourage all to speak in tongues in the church meetings is not right; it is against the Apostle Paul&#8217;s word. Paul&#8217;s word in verse 23 is a strong discouragement to the excessive practice of speaking in tongues.<h2 class=head2>N. Saying That There Is No Resurrection of the Dead</h2><p>In chapter fifteen of 1 Corinthians Paul deals with the Corinthians&#8217; heretical saying that there is no resurrection of the dead. In verse 12 Paul asks, &#8220;If Christ is preached that He has been raised from among the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?&#8221; Some of the Corinthians were like the Sadducees (Matt. 22:23; Acts 23:8) in saying that there is no resurrection. Denying the resurrection is most damaging and destructive to God&#8217;s New Testament economy. This is worse than the heresy of Hymenaeus and Philetus concerning resurrection in 2 Timothy 2:17 and 18. Resurrection is the life pulse and lifeline of the divine economy. If there were no resurrection, God would be the God of the dead, not the God of the living (Matt. 22:32). He would be a dead Savior, not the One who lives forever (Rev. 1:18) and is able to save to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25). If there were no resurrection, there would be no living proof of justification by His death (Rom. 4:25), no imparting of life (John 12:24), no regeneration (John 3:5), no renewing (Titus 3:5), no transformation (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18), and no conformity to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29). If there were no resurrection, there would be no members of Christ (Rom. 12:5), no Body of Christ as His fullness (Eph. 1:20-23), and no church as Christ&#8217;s bride (John 3:29) and the new man (Eph. 2:15; 4:24; Col. 3:10-11). If there were no resurrection, God&#8217;s New Testament economy would altogether collapse and God&#8217;s eternal purpose would be nullified.<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:12 Paul refers to the preaching that Christ has been raised from among the dead. This indicates clearly that the apostles preached the resurrection of Christ. According to the book of Acts, the preaching of the gospel was mainly the preaching of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. We today must follow the apostles to emphasize resurrection as well as crucifixion.<h2 class=head2>O. Walking Disorderly</h2><p>Finally, in the churches there was the failure of walking disorderly. Second Thessalonians 3:11 says, &#8220;We hear of some walking among you disorderly, working at nothing, but busybodies.&#8221; It may seem that walking disorderly is a small point. Nevertheless, it is practical. A disorderly walk is not only according to the flesh (Rom. 8:4), but is also against the building up of the church life (1 Thes. 5:11; Rom. 14:19; 1 Cor. 10:23).<p>According to Paul&#8217;s word in verse 11, those who were walking disorderly were busy but &#8220;working at nothing&#8221;; they were busy only with what was not their own business. Busybodies are nobody, and with them there is no Body of Christ.<p>I believe that the disorderliness in Thessalonica came from the misconception regarding the Lord&#8217;s coming back. Some believers thought that the Lord Jesus would be coming back soon, and therefore that it was not necessary for them to work. Their concept may have been that as long as they had something to eat and could survive, that was adequate. Those who hold such a concept go beyond the level of proper spirituality and walk disorderly.<p>In 2 Thessalonians 3:6 Paul charges the believers to keep away from any brother who walks disorderly. This indicates that Paul considers it a serious matter to walk disorderly, for this is a damage to the church life.<p>Even while the apostles were still on earth, there were many failures in the churches. These failures involved such things as ambition for vainglory, tradition, lust, not believing in Christ&#8217;s resurrection, and not having the proper practice of the Lord&#8217;s table. God&#8217;s intention in recording these failures in the holy Word is to give us a warning concerning the possibility of such failures recurring in the church life. We need to learn from all these failures and do our best to avoid them. If the churches in the apostles&#8217; time could suffer all these failures, it is even more likely that today, if we are careless, we also shall suffer the same kind of failures. Therefore, we need to look to the Lord that we may be kept from these failures.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE DEGRADATION OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>In this message we shall begin to consider the degradation of the church.<h2 class=head1>XII. THE DEGRADATION OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>There is a difference between the failures in the churches and the degradation of the church. The failures are not serious in a basic way. Whereas the failures in the churches are not that basic, the degradation of the church is more than basic, for it cuts the root of the life, living, and growth of the church. Unlike failure, degradation not only brings in wrongdoings but cuts the root of the church &#8220;tree.&#8221;<p>Seemingly, James&#8217;s compromising with certain Old Testament practices was nearly the same as a part of the degradation of the church. However, this failure was different from people in the church taking in the Old Testament, as the Judaizers did. The Judaizers were more basic a problem than James was in compromising. It was a failure for James to compromise. Nevertheless, James did not take in the Old Testament. Misunderstanding James, the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem thought that he was for the Old Testament. They called a congregation and asked James to give them a word. James spoke absolutely for Jesus Christ, not for the Old Testament, and due to his speaking he was put to death. Therefore, our criticism of James should be limited. Although he compromised, he was not for the Old Testament and he was not a Judaizer.<p>By comparing the compromise of James with the work of the Judaizers we can see that the degradation of the church is worse than a failure in the church. Degradation is not merely a failure, which is not that basic or vital. Because degradation kills the life of the church, cutting the root of the tree, it is more basic and vital than a failure. We need to be impressed with this as we consider the various aspects of the degradation of the church described in the New Testament.<h2 class=head2>A. Being Taken Over by the Gnostic Philosophy and the Elements of the World- the Rudimentary Teachings of Both Jews and Gentiles, Consisting of Ritualistic Observances in Meats, Drinks, Washings, and Asceticism</h2><p>The first aspect of the degradation of the church was the church&#8217;s being taken over by the Gnostic philosophy and the elements of the world-the rudimentary teachings of both Jews and Gentiles, consisting of ritualistic observances in such things as meats, drinks, washings, and asceticism (Col. 2:8, 16, 20-22; Titus 1:14-15). Gnosticism is a composition of Greek and Oriental philosophy and Jewish religion. When the church spread to the Gentile world, the church was contaminated by Gnosticism. This contamination became a root problem in the church; it nearly cut off the entire root of the church life. Therefore, Gnosticism was a serious threat to the existence of the church life.<p>Because of the danger of Gnosticism, Paul said in Colossians 2:8, &#8220;Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.&#8221; The word &#8220;spoil&#8221; here does not mean to damage; it means to be a prey or a captive. Those who are carried off as spoil are carried off into captivity. In Greek the word rendered &#8220;his&#8221; before &#8220;philosophy&#8221; is the emphatic article. Hence, it denotes a particular philosophy. The philosophy through which the believers at Colosse were carried off as spoil was Gnosticism, a mixture of Jewish, Oriental, and Greek philosophies. As Paul indicates, Gnosticism is empty deceit.<p>The philosophy and empty deceit in this verse is according to the tradition of men. The source of the Gnostic teaching at Colosse was the tradition of men. It did not depend on the revealed writings of God but on the traditional practices of men.<p>The philosophy and empty deceit in 2:8 are not only according to the tradition of men but also according to the elements of the world, Here and in Colossians 2:20 and Galatians 4:3 the expression &#8220;the elements of the world&#8221; does not refer to substances; rather, it refers to the rudimentary teachings of both Jews and Gentiles, teachings that consist of ritualistic observances in meats, drinks, washings, and asceticism. In the eyes of Paul, the traditions of men were merely elementary principles. These traditions are included with the elementary principles of the world.<p>Paul concludes Colossians 2:8 by saying that the philosophy and empty deceit are not according to Christ. Christ is the governing principle of all genuine wisdom and knowledge, the reality of all genuine teaching, and the only measure of all concepts acceptable to God.<p>In Colossians 2:16 and 17 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.&#8221; The Greek words rendered &#8220;in eating and in drinking&#8221; may also be translated &#8220;in food and in drink.&#8221; Food and drink signify satisfaction and strengthening. The feasts denote the annual Jewish festivals, which signify joy and enjoyment, and the new moon signifies a new beginning with light in darkness. Furthermore, the Sabbaths signify completion and rest. All these items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, just as a shadow is a figure of a person&#8217;s body. The festivals, the new moons, the Sabbaths, and the regulations concerning eating and drinking all were shadows. The body, the solid substance, of the shadows is Christ.<p>In Colossians 2:20 Paul says, &#8220;If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why as living in the world do you subject yourself to ordinances.&#8221; The elements of the world include Jewish observances, heathen ordinances, and philosophy. They also include mysticism and asceticism. The elements of the world are the elementary principles of worldly society, the rudimentary principles invented by mankind and practiced in society. With Christ we have died to these elements of the world. When Christ was crucified, we were crucified also. In His crucifixion we were released from the elementary principles of the world.<p>Since we have died with Christ from the elements of the world, Paul asks us why as living in the world we subject ourselves to ordinances, to the elementary principles from which we have died in Christ. The world in verse 20 refers not to the physical earth but to human society. Therefore, here Paul is asking the believers why they still subject themselves to ordinances as if they were still living in human society.<p>In verse 21 Paul lists some of these ordinances: &#8220;Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch.&#8221; These are rules and regulations in material things. These rules refer respectively to things that move, to things that are edible, and to things that are tangible. Handling, tasting, and touching include virtually every kind of action. Because these regulations are related to the practice of asceticism, to submit to ordinances concerning handling, tasting, and touching is to practice asceticism.<p>In Titus 1:14 and 15 Paul again addresses the influence of Gnosticism. The first part of verse 14 says, &#8220;Not paying attention to Jewish myths.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;myths&#8221; here refers to words, speeches, and conversations concerning such things as rumors, reports, stories, and fictions. It may include Jewish stories of miracles, or rabbinical fabrications. These myths were the profane and old-womanish tales (1 Tim. 4:7). The Jewish myths mentioned here may have been the seed of the Gnostic mythologies.<p>In verse 14 Paul also mentions &#8220;commandments of men who turn away from the truth.&#8221; According to the following verse, these commandments must have been precepts concerning abstinence from meats and other things ordained by God for man&#8217;s use. These were the commandments of the earlier Gnostics, not the ascetics, who adopted their theosophy from Jewish sources, probably some derivation from the Mosaic law.<p>In verse 15 Paul continues, &#8220;All things are pure to the pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience have been defiled.&#8221; The statement, &#8220;All things are pure to the pure,&#8221; must have been a Christian maxim. The apostle quoted it to refute the commandments of men, that is, the precepts of abstinence, which forbade certain actions and the eating of certain foods (1 Tim. 4:3-5; Rom. 14:20).<h2 class=head2>B. Teaching Things Different from the Economy of God Taught by the Apostle, Resulting in Turning Away from the Apostle&#8217;s Teaching</h2><p>Another aspect of the degradation of the church was the teaching of things different from the economy of God taught by the apostle, resulting in turning away from the apostle&#8217;s teaching. Acts 2:42 tells us that all the new believers continued steadfastly in the teaching of the apostles. What the apostles taught was according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy. But at a certain time some teachers began to teach certain biblical things, yet those things were different from the economy of God, that is, different from the teaching of the apostles. Eventually this resulted in a turning away from Paul&#8217;s teaching (2 Tim. 1:15).<p>In 1 Timothy 1:3 and 4 Paul says, &#8220;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently, nor to occupy themselves with myths and unending genealogies, which give occasion for questionings rather than God&#8217;s dispensation which is in faith.&#8221; &#8220;Certain ones&#8221; were dissenting ones, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:6 and Galatians 1:7; 2:12. To teach differently was to teach myths, unending genealogies, and the law (1 Tim. 1:7-8), all of which were vain talking (v. 6), differing from the apostles&#8217; teaching centered upon Christ and the church.<p>God&#8217;s dispensation, His household economy (Eph. 1:10; 3:9), is God&#8217;s household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a household to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ (1 Tim. 3:15). Paul&#8217;s ministry was centered upon this economy of God (Col. 1:25; 1 Cor. 9:17), whereas the differing teachings of the dissenting ones were used by God&#8217;s enemy to distract His people from this.<p>If we read 1 Timothy 1 carefully, we shall realize that what was condemned by the apostle as different teachings was not altogether heresy. Some taught things from the Old Testament such as genealogies (v. 4) and the law given by God to Moses (vv. 7-8). The law is not heresy, but to teach the law is a different teaching from the teaching of the apostles. Different teachings stress something other than Christ and the church. To be one in teaching is to be uniquely one in the teaching of the apostles, not in the minor things such as the presbytery, the gifts, baptism by immersion, foot-washing, head covering, or the ordinances of the Lord&#8217;s table. We should not stress things which are not so crucial to the central lane of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. We should not ignore them, but if we are taking care of the apostles&#8217; teaching, they should not be the emphasis of our teaching.<p>In 1 Timothy 6:3-5a Paul says, &#8220;If anyone teaches differently and does not consent to healthy words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which is according to godliness, he is blinded with pride, understanding nothing, but is sick with questionings and contentions of words, out of which come envy, strife, revilings, evil suspicions, perpetual wranglings of men corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth.&#8221; As in 1:3, to teach differently is to teach something that is different from the apostles&#8217; teaching focused on Christ and the church. First Timothy 6:4 and 5 indicate that teachings differing from the healthy words of the Lord always issue from people&#8217;s pride with self-conceit which blinds them. Paul and his co-workers taught in a certain way, but some who were blinded with pride deliberately taught differently.<p>In verse 4 Paul uses the expression &#8220;sick with questionings.&#8221; To question and contend about words is a sickness. The word &#8220;reviling&#8221; in this verse means blasphemies. As in Colossians 3:8, it refers to revilings, railings toward man, not blasphemies toward God.<p>In verse 5 Paul speaks of &#8220;perpetual wranglings of men corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth.&#8221; The Greek words for &#8220;perpetual wranglings&#8221; can also be rendered &#8220;incessant quarrels.&#8221; These wranglings are carried on by men corrupted and depraved in mind and deprived, bereft, destitute, of the truth. The Greek word for &#8220;deprived&#8221; implies that these are ones who once possessed the truth, but now it has been put away from them. Hence, they are destitute of the truth.<h2 class=head2>C. Supposing Godliness to Be a Means of Gain</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 6:5b Paul speaks of those who suppose &#8220;godliness to be a means of gain.&#8221; They make godliness a way of gain-material profit, a gain-making trade. The desire for material gain is another reason certain ones teach differently from the economy of God taught by the apostles. Thus, because of pride and the desire for profit, for riches, some are teaching differently. Pride is related to wanting a name and a good reputation, and gain is related to money and material profit.<h2 class=head2>D. Turning Away from the Apostle Who Completed the Divine Revelation</h2><p>Paul&#8217;s Epistles are the completion of the divine revelation concerning God&#8217;s eternal purpose and economy (Col. 1:25). His ministry completes the revelation concerning the all-inclusive Christ and His universal Body, the church as His fullness to express Him. Nevertheless, in the degradation of the church, many turned away from Paul&#8217;s ministry. &#8220;This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me&#8221; (2 Tim. 1:15). This indicates that the believers in Asia, a province of the Roman Empire, who had formerly received the apostle&#8217;s ministry now forsook him. This means that they forsook not Paul&#8217;s person but his teaching, his ministry. Among the churches in Asia was the church in Ephesus, which was fully established by Paul&#8217;s ministry as recorded in Acts 19. The church in Ephesus received the gospel, the teaching, the edification, and the establishment from the ministry of the Apostle Paul. Nevertheless, due to the ministry of Apollos, the church in Ephesus took the lead to forsake Paul&#8217;s ministry. Those who turned away from Paul&#8217;s ministry deviated from God&#8217;s complete revelation, the center of which is Christ as the mystery in the saints (Col. 1:27).<p>Some expositors say that 2 Timothy 1:15 points to an apostasy, a departure from the truth. But what was the extent of the apostasy? I believe that &#8220;all who are in Asia&#8221; points to the general situation among the believers in Asia without including every particular believer. Generally speaking, there was apostasy in Asia.<h2 class=head2>E. Bringing In Heresies as Gangrene Making People Wooden and Earthen Vessels unto Dishonor in the Great House</h2><p>Second Timothy 2:16-18 says, &#8220;Avoid profane, vain babblings, for they will advance to more ungodliness, and their word will spread as gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus, who concerning the truth have misaimed, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and overthrow the faith of some.&#8221; Here Paul refers to those who bring in heresies as gangrene. In verse 17 the Greek word rendered &#8220;spread&#8221; may also be translated &#8220;feed&#8221; or &#8220;eat.&#8221; Literally it means &#8220;will find pasture,&#8221; as in John 10:9. The word for pasture in Greek is the medical term for the consuming progress of a mortifying disease (Alford). Hence, its meaning in verse 17 is to spread. The word &#8220;gangrene&#8221; denotes an eating sore, a cancer. Paul used such a strong word to describe those who teach differently. He tells us that their word not only advances unto more ungodliness, but that it spreads as gangrene which consumes the flesh and causes part of one&#8217;s body to die. This has been the situation among certain dissenting ones.<p>In verse 18 Paul tells us that concerning the truth Hymenaeus and Philetus have misaimed. The word &#8220;misaimed&#8221; means to miss the mark, swerve, deviate. Paul does not say that Hymenaeus and Philetus misaimed concerning doctrine or teaching; he says that they misaimed concerning the truth, concerning the reality of the New Testament economy. They swerved from the truth by saying that the resurrection had already taken place. This is to claim that there will be no resurrection. This is a serious heresy, for it denies the divine power in life (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:16; Rev. 20:4, 6).<p>In 2 Timothy 2:18 Paul also says that by having misaimed concerning the truth, Hymenaeus and Philetus overthrew the faith of some. Faith here is subjective and refers to the act of believing. This subjective faith, our believing act, is very much related to the resurrection of Christ (Rom. 10:9). This subjective faith involves an organic union between us and the Triune God. For one&#8217;s faith to be overthrown is to have the inward organic union damaged in some way. This was the overthrowing of their faith.<p>Those who bring in heresies as gangrene make people wooden and earthen vessels unto dishonor in the great house. &#8220;In a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen, and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor&#8221; (2 Tim. 2:20). The house of God defined in 1 Timothy 3:15 and 16 is the genuine church in its divine nature and essential character as the foundation of the truth, whereas the great house here refers to the deteriorated church in its mixed character, as illustrated by the abnormally big tree in Matthew 13:31 and 32. In this great house there are not only precious vessels but also base ones. The honorable vessels are of both the divine nature (gold) and the redeemed and regenerated human nature (silver). These, like Timothy and other genuine believers, constitute the sure foundation to hold the truth. Dishonorable vessels are of the fallen human nature (wood and earth). Hymenaeus, Philetus, and other false believers are of these.<p>The great tree in Matthew 13:32 equals the great house in 2 Timothy 2:20. The church should be like an herb to produce food, but it became a &#8220;tree,&#8221; a lodge for birds, having its nature and function changed. (This is against the law of God&#8217;s creation, that every plant must be after its kind-Gen. 1:11-12.) Instead of producing food for nourishment, the great tree is good only for lodging &#8220;the birds of heaven,&#8221; which refer to Satan&#8217;s evil spirits with the evil persons and things motivated by them. These lodge in the branches of the great tree.<h2 class=head2>F. Having a Form of Godliness but Having Denied Its Power</h2><p>In 2 Timothy 3:1-7 we have a picture of the corrupted situation of the great house mentioned in 2:20. In verse 5a Paul says, &#8220;Having a form of godliness, but having denied its power.&#8221; A form of godliness is a mere outward semblance without the essential reality. The power of godliness is the real and practical virtue of a living influence to express God. Those who have a form of godliness but deny its power pretend to have godliness but reject the Spirit, which is the power of godliness.<h2 class=head2>G. Not Following Healthy Teaching, but Heaping Up Teachings to Tickle the Ear</h2><p>In 2 Timothy 4:3 and 4 Paul says, &#8220;The time will come when they will not tolerate healthy teaching, but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers tickling the ear, and they will turn away their ear from the truth, and will be turned aside to fables.&#8221; The time mentioned here is the time when the decline of the church becomes worse. At that time many will not tolerate healthy teaching, teaching which is healthy in life and which ministers the supply of life. Instead, they will prefer teachers who tickle the ear. This indicates that those who do not tolerate healthy teaching have an itching ear, an ear which seeks pleasing speaking for its own pleasure. Furthermore, such persons will turn away their ear from the truth and will be turned aside to fables. The itching ear that is turned away from the truth is the main factor of the worsening decline in the churches.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE DEGRADATION OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover further aspects of the degradation of the church.<h2 class=head2>H. Some Becoming Factious</h2><p>Titus 3:10 and 11 say, &#8220;A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse, knowing that such a one has been perverted and sins, being self-condemned.&#8221; A factious man is a heretical, sectarian man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinions. The Gnostic Judaism referred to in the preceding verse must be related to this. The divisiveness is based on differing teachings. This is the reason that verse 10 comes after verse 9. Certain believers may have insisted on the teaching of the law and in so doing became divisive.<p>In verse 10 Paul charges Titus to refuse a factious man after a first and second admonition. In order to maintain good order in the church, a factious, divisive person, after a first and second admonition, should be refused, rejected. Because such divisiveness is contagious, this rejection is for the church&#8217;s profit that contact with the divisive one may be stopped.<p>In verse 11 Paul speaks a severe word, saying that a factious man has been perverted, that he sins, and that he is self-condemned. Literally, the Greek words translated &#8220;has been perverted&#8221; mean turned out of the way. It is more than being turned away from the right path. One who has been perverted in this way is spoiled, damaged, destroyed, with respect to God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h2 class=head2>I. Backsliding to Judaism, Neglecting God&#8217;s New Testament Salvation</h2><p>In Hebrews 10:25-29 Paul warns the Hebrew believers not to forsake the church to sin willfully, that is, to go back to Judaism to offer the sacrifice for sin which has been terminated.<p>Hebrews 10:25 says, &#8220;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.&#8221; For the Hebrew believers at their time and in their situation to forsake the assembling of themselves together was to forsake the new covenant way of contacting God, to forsake the church and return to their old religion-Judaism. This would break God&#8217;s administration of grace, thus constituting a serious sin before God.<p>Verse 26 continues, &#8220;For when we sin willfully after receiving the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.&#8221; To sin willfully here means to forsake the assembling of ourselves together with the church. The Hebrew believers had been instructed to abandon Judaism and remain under the new covenant. If they would still return to Judaism, they would forsake assembling with the church. This constitutes a willful sin in the eyes of God after receiving the knowledge of the truth, after knowing that God had forsaken Judaism, which was formed according to the old covenant, and had established the new and living way of contacting God according to the new covenant. For the Hebrew believers to shrink back to Judaism and offer again the sacrifice for sin would be to do something which God had terminated.<p>Verse 26 says that &#8220;there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins&#8221; for those who sin willfully. If the Hebrew believers had forsaken the church and returned to Judaism, there would have remained no sacrifice for sin in the economy of God, for all the sacrifices of the old covenant have been altogether replaced by the one sacrifice of Christ. Since Christ has once for all offered Himself as the sacrifice for our sins (Heb. 7:27; 10:10, 12), the sacrifice for sin has ceased (Heb. 10:2), having been taken away by Christ (Heb. 10:9).<p>We should not misinterpret Hebrews 10:26, thinking that if we sin willfully after being saved our sins cannot be forgiven because there is no more sacrifice for sin. The willful sin mentioned in this verse is forsaking the church and shrinking back to the old covenant after knowing that God had annulled it and established a new one. Forsaking the church to return to Judaism to offer the sacrifice for sin when there was no longer any such thing was, in the eyes of God, a willful sin.<p>Hebrews 10:29 says, &#8220;By how much do you think he shall be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has regarded the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?&#8221; In the new covenant the Son of God replaces all the sacrifices of the old covenant. If the Hebrew believers would still return to Judaism to offer any of the old sacrifices, they would in effect be trampling underfoot the Son of God. They would be despising Him, disregarding Him, and putting Him under their feet.<p>Verse 29 speaks of regarding the blood of the covenant a common thing. If the Hebrew believers would have returned to Judaism to offer the old sacrifices and rely on the blood of the slain animals, they would in effect have regarded the precious blood of Christ a common thing. That would have been a serious disregard of the unique redemptive work of Christ. Since animal blood was common, it could be offered again and again. If, after receiving Christ, the Hebrew believers returned to Judaism to offer again the sacrifices for sin, they would have been making the blood of Christ the same as animal blood. This is an insult to Christ.<p>Hebrews 10:29 also speaks of insulting the Spirit of grace. Under the new covenant, through the redeeming blood of Christ, the Hebrew believers had become partakers of the Holy Spirit (Heb. 6:4), the Spirit of grace. If they had returned to Judaism to offer the sacrifices for sin, this would have been against the work of the Spirit of grace who was indwelling them and working in them and who would have been insulted by their willful sin.<p>To backslide to Judaism is to neglect God&#8217;s New Testament salvation. Hebrews 2:3 says, &#8220;How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?&#8221; Salvation here refers back to what is mentioned in 1:14. It is God&#8217;s full salvation, from the forgiveness of sin to the sharing of the coming kingdom with glory. It not only refers to what Christ has done and will do for us but also to Himself, who is able to save us to the uttermost (7:25). He, the Son of God and the Son of Man, is our salvation. His wonderful person plus His splendid work is so great a salvation, a salvation which none of us should neglect. Our negligence will cause us to miss this so great a salvation&#8217;s most precious part-enjoying Christ as our saving life and rest in this age-and most glorious part-inheriting Christ&#8217;s kingdom with glory in the coming age. Therefore, we should not neglect so great a salvation. If we neglect it, we shall receive a just recompense regarding it (Heb. 2:2).<h2 class=head2>J. False Teachers Bringing In Destructive Heresies, Even Denying the Master Who Bought Them, and Following the Way of Balaam Who Loved the Wages of Unrighteousness</h2><p>Second Peter 2:1 says, &#8220;There arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.&#8221; The Greek words rendered &#8220;secretly bring in&#8221; may also be translated &#8220;bring in by smuggling.&#8221; Literally, the Greek means to bring in alongside, to bring in sideways, to introduce a new subject for which the hearers are not prepared. Here it denotes the false teachers bringing in and introducing their false teachings alongside the true ones. These false teachings are called destructive heresies, or, literally, heresies of destruction.<p>&#8220;Heresy&#8221; is an anglicized Greek word, hairesis, which means choices of opinion of doctrine different from that usually accepted, &#8220;self-chosen doctrines alien from the truth&#8221; (Alford), thus causing division and producing sects. Here this word denotes the false and heretical doctrines brought in by the false teachers, the heretics, similar to the doctrines of today&#8217;s Modernism, which denies the deity of Christ and the redemptive death of Christ.<p>Heresy involves three matters: opinion, the causing of divisions, and the producing of sects. Therefore, opinion, divisions, and sects are the three constituents of heresy. Instead of building up the church, heresy destroys the church. For this reason, Peter speaks of destructive heresies, or heresies of destruction.<p>In Peter&#8217;s words, the false teachers even deny the Master who bought them. The word &#8220;Master&#8221; implies the Lord&#8217;s person and His redemptive work. The false teachers at Peter&#8217;s time, like today&#8217;s Modernists in their apostasy, denied both the Lord&#8217;s person as the Master and His redemption, by which He purchased the believers.<p>Speaking of the false teachers, Peter says in verse 15, &#8220;Forsaking the straight way, they have gone astray, following the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness.&#8221; The straight way here, as the way of the truth (v. 2) and the way of righteousness (v. 21), is the living of an upright life without crookedness and bias, without unrighteousness.<p>Having gone astray, the false teachers followed the way of Balaam. Balaam was not a false prophet of the Gentiles but a real prophet. However, Balaam was one who loved the wages of unrighteousness (Num. 22:5, 7; Deut. 23:4; Neh. 13:2; Rev. 2:14).<h2 class=head2>K. Denying That Jesus Is the Christ, and Becoming the Antichrist, Not Abiding in the Son and in the Father</h2><p>First John 2:22 says, &#8220;Who is the liar if not he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, who is denying the Father and the Son.&#8221; This is the heresy of Cerinthus, a first century Syrian heresiarch of Jewish descent, educated at Alexandria. His heresy was a mixture of Judaism, Gnosticism, and Christianity. He distinguished the maker (creator) of the world from God, and represented that maker as a subordinate power. He taught adoptionist Christology (Adoptionism), saying that Jesus became the Son of God by exaltation to a status that was not His by birth, thus denying the conception of Jesus by the Holy Spirit. In his heresy he separated the earthly man Jesus, regarded as the son of Joseph and Mary, from the heavenly Christ, and taught that after Jesus was baptized, Christ as a dove descended upon Him. Then He announced the unknown Father and did miracles, but at the end of His ministry Christ departed from Jesus, and Jesus suffered death on the cross and rose from the dead, while Christ remained separated as a spiritual being, and will rejoin the man Jesus at the coming of the Messianic kingdom of glory. This heresy denied that Jesus is the Christ. According to John&#8217;s word, anyone who denies that Jesus is the Christ is the antichrist. Cerinthus was an antichrist, and his followers also were antichrists.<p>In verse 22 John says that the antichrist denies the Father and the Son. To confess that Jesus is the Christ is to confess that He is the Son of God (Matt. 16:16; John 20:31). Hence, to deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Father and the Son. Whoever so denies the divine person of Christ is an antichrist.<p>In verse 23 John continues, &#8220;Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also.&#8221; Since the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30; Isa. 9:6), to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father. To deny the Son here refers to the heresy that denies the deity of Christ, not confessing that the man Jesus is God.<p>In verse 24 John goes on to say, &#8220;As for you, that which you heard from the beginning, let it abide in you. If that which you heard from the beginning abides in you, you will abide both in the Son and in the Father.&#8221; &#8220;That which you heard from the beginning&#8221; is the Word of life, the eternal life which the believers heard from the beginning (1 John 1:1-2). Not to deny but to confess that the man Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, is to let the Word of eternal life abide in us. In so doing we abide both in the Son and in the Father, and we are not led astray by heretical teachings concerning Christ&#8217;s person.<p>Verse 25 continues, &#8220;And this is the promise which He promised us, the eternal life.&#8221; The singular pronoun &#8220;He&#8221; here, referring to both the Son and the Father in verse 24, indicates that the Son and the Father are one. As far as our experience of the divine life is concerned, the Son, the Father, Jesus, and Christ are all one. It is not that only the Son and not the Father is the eternal life to us. It is that Jesus being the Christ as the Son and the Father is the eternal divine life to us for our portion.<p>Verse 26 says, &#8220;These things I have written to you concerning those who are leading you astray.&#8221; The Greek words &#8220;leading you astray&#8221; may also be rendered &#8220;deceiving you.&#8221; To lead the believers astray is to distract them from the truth concerning Christ&#8217;s deity and humanity by deceiving them with heretical teachings concerning the mysteries of what Christ is.<h2 class=head2>L. Not Confessing That Jesus Christ Has Come in the Flesh</h2><p>First John 4:1 says, &#8220;Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are out of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.&#8221; The expressions &#8220;every spirit&#8221; and &#8220;the spirits&#8221; refer to the spirits of the prophets (1 Cor. 14:32) motivated by the Spirit of truth, or the spirits of the false prophets actuated by the spirit of deception. Hence, there is the need to discern the spirits by proving them to see whether they are out of God.<p>In verse 2 John goes on to say, &#8220;In this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is out of God.&#8221; Such a spirit is the spirit of a genuine prophet motivated by the Holy Spirit of truth, which confesses the divine conception of Jesus, affirming that He was born as the Son of God. Every such spirit is surely out of God. In this we know the Spirit of God.<p>Jesus was conceived of the Spirit (Matt. 1:18). To confess Jesus coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God (Luke 1:31-35). Since He was conceived of the Spirit to be born in the flesh, the Spirit would never deny that He has come in the flesh through divine conception.<p>In verse 3 John continues, &#8220;And every spirit which does not confess Jesus, is not out of God; and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now is already in the world.&#8221; The spirit in this verse is the spirit of a false prophet actuated by the spirit of deception, which does not confess Jesus coming in the flesh. This is the spirit of the errors of the Docetists. This name was derived from the Greek dokein, &#8220;to seem,&#8221; &#8220;appear to be.&#8221; The heretical view of the Docetists was that Jesus Christ was not a real man, but simply appeared so; He was just a phantasm. Docetism was mixed up with Gnosticism which taught that all matter was essentially evil. Hence, the Docetists taught that, since Christ is holy, He could never have had the defilement of human flesh; His body was not real flesh and blood but merely a deceptive, transient phantom, so that He did not suffer, die, and resurrect. Such heresy undermines not only the Lord&#8217;s incarnation, but also His redemption and resurrection. Docetism was a characteristic feature of the first antichristian errorists whom John had in view here and in 2 John 7. The spirit of such errorists is surely not out of God. This is the spirit of the antichrist.<p>Second John 7 says, &#8220;Many deceivers went out into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.&#8221; The deceivers mentioned here were heretics, like the Cerinthians, the false prophets. These deceivers do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This means that they do not confess that Jesus is God incarnate. They deny the deity of Christ. In verse 7 John says that those who do not confess Jesus coming in the flesh are not only deceivers but also antichrists. An antichrist differs from a false Christ (Matt. 24:5, 24). A false Christ is one who pretends deceivingly to be the Christ, whereas an antichrist is one who denies Christ&#8217;s deity, denying that Jesus is the Christ, that is, denying the Father and the Son by denying that Jesus is the Son of God (1 John 2:22), not confessing that He has come in the flesh through the divine conception of the Holy Spirit. Whoever denies the person of Christ is an antichrist.<h2 class=head2>M. Not Abiding in the Teaching of Christ</h2><p>Second John 9 says, &#8220;Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son.&#8221; Literally, the Greek word translated &#8220;goes beyond&#8221; means to lead forward (in a negative sense), that is, to go further than what is right, to advance beyond the limit of orthodox teaching concerning Christ. This is contrasted with abiding in the teaching of Christ. The Cerinthian Gnostics, who boasted of their supposedly advanced thinking concerning the teaching of Christ, had such a practice. They went beyond the teaching of the divine conception of Christ, thus denying the deity of Christ. Consequently they could not have God in salvation and in life.<p>In verse 9 John speaks of not abiding in the teaching of Christ. This is not the teaching by Christ but the teaching concerning Christ, that is, the truth concerning the deity of Christ, especially regarding His incarnation by divine conception.<p>According to verse 9, the one who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God. But he who abides in the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son. To &#8220;have God&#8221; is to have &#8220;both the Father and the Son.&#8221; It is through the process of incarnation that God has been dispensed to us in the Son with the Father (1 John 2:23) for our enjoyment and reality (John 1:1, 14). In the incarnated God we have the Son in His redemption and the Father in His life. We are thus redeemed and regenerated to be one with God organically so that we may partake of and enjoy Him in salvation and in life. Hence, to deny the incarnation is to reject this divine enjoyment, but to abide in the truth of incarnation is to have God, as the Father and the Son, for our portion in the eternal salvation and in the divine life.<p>In verse 10 John goes on to say, &#8220;If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; refers to a heretic, an antichrist, a false prophet, who denies the divine conception and deity of Christ, as today&#8217;s Modernists do. Such a one we must reject, not receiving him into our house or greeting him. Thus, we shall not have any contact with him or share in his heresy, heresy that is blasphemous to God and contagious like leprosy.<p>Do not think that because we are told to love others we should receive a heretic. Concerning this, love does not avail. John says clearly that we should not receive an antichrist, a false prophet, into our house, and we should not even say to him, &#8220;Rejoice!&#8221; The point here is that we should have nothing to do with such persons and their contagious heresy.<p>In verse 11 John says, &#8220;For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works.&#8221; Just as bringing to others the divine truth of the wonderful Christ is an excellent deed (Rom. 10:15), so spreading the satanic heresy, which defiles the glorious divinity of Christ, is an evil work. It is a blasphemy and abomination to God, and it is also a damage and curse to men. No believer in Christ and child of God should have any share in this evil. Even to greet such an evil one is prohibited. A severe and clear separation from this evil should be maintained.<h2 class=head2>N. Loving to Be First in the Church</h2><p>Third John 9 and 10 say, &#8220;I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us. Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with evil words; and not being satisfied with these, neither does he receive the brothers, and those intending to do so he forbids and casts them out of the church.&#8221; Diotrephes&#8217; loving to be first was against the words of the Lord Jesus in Matthew 20:25-27 and 23:8-11, which place all His believers on the same level, that of brothers.<p>In 2 John 9 the Cerinthian Gnostics took the lead to advance in doctrine beyond the teaching concerning Christ. Here in 3 John 9 is one who was under the influence of Gnostic heretical doctrine, loving to be first in the church. The problem of Gnostic doctrine was one of intellectual arrogance; the problem of loving to be first was one of self-exaltation in action. These two evils are sharp weapons used by God&#8217;s enemy, Satan, to execute his evil plot against God&#8217;s economy. One damages the believers&#8217; faith in the divine reality; the other frustrates their work in God&#8217;s move. Loving to be first brings in degradation.<p>The principle was the same both with the Cerinthian Gnostics in their desire to be advanced in doctrine and with Diotrephes&#8217; love to be first: they wanted to be above others. The Cerinthians wanted to be above others in advanced thought, and Diotrephes wanted to be first.<p>Third John 10 exposes how domineering and evil Diotrephes was: he babbled against the Apostle John with evil words. The Greek word translated &#8220;babbling,&#8221; phluareo, comes from phluo, to boil over, to bubble up, to overflow with words, to talk idly; hence, to babble, to talk folly or nonsense. The babbling of Diotrephes was with &#8220;evil words.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;evil&#8221; here is poneros, which denotes something pernicious, something harmfully evil that affects and influences others to be evil and vicious.<h2 class=head2>O. Forsaking the Faith, Denying Our Only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ, Having Gone in the Way of Cain, Poured Themselves Out in the Error of Balaam for Reward, and Perished in the Rebellion of Korah</h2><p>In the degradation of the church some forsook the faith. This was the reason Jude wrote, &#8220;Beloved, using all diligence to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you, entreating you to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints&#8221; (Jude 3). The faith in this verse is not subjective; it is objective. It does not refer to our believing, but refers to our belief, to what we believe. The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith (Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 1:19; 3:9; 4:1; 5:8; 6:10, 21; 2 Tim. 2:18; 3:8; 4:7; Titus 1:13), in which we believe for our common salvation. This faith, not any doctrine, has been delivered once for all to the saints. For this faith we should contend (1 Tim. 6:12).<p>In verse 4 Jude goes on to say, &#8220;Certain men have crept in unnoticed, who of old have been written of beforehand for this judgment, ungodly men, perverting the grace of our God into licentiousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.&#8221; Literally, the Greek words translated &#8220;crept in unnoticed&#8221; mean to get in by the side, or to slip in by a side door. As the enemy crept in to sow tares among the wheat (see Matt. 13:25, 27-28), the apostates crept in unnoticed.<p>In this verse Jude speaks of ungodly men who pervert the grace of God into licentiousness and deny our Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. The evil of these heretical apostates is twofold: perverting the grace of God into wantonness, that is, into the abuse of freedom (see Gal. 5:13; 1 Pet. 2:16), and denying the headship and lordship of the Lord. These two go together. Turning the grace of God into an abused freedom for wantonness requires denying the Lord&#8217;s rule and authority.<p>In verse 11 Jude speaks of the way of Cain, the error of Balaam, and the rebellion of Korah. &#8220;Woe to them! Because they have gone in the way of Cain, and poured themselves out in the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.&#8221; The way of Cain is the way of serving God religiously after one&#8217;s own will and rejecting heretically the redemption by blood required and ordained by God. Those who follow the way of Cain are according to the flesh and envy God&#8217;s true people because of their faithful testimony to God (Gen. 4:2-8).<p>Jude says that the apostates have &#8220;poured themselves out in the error of Balaam for reward.&#8221; For the apostates to have poured themselves out in this way means that they gave themselves up to this error, rushed headlong into it, ran riotously in it. The error of Balaam is the error of teaching wrong doctrine for reward, although the one teaching knows that it is contrary to the truth and against the people of God. The error of Balaam also involves abusing the influence of certain gifts to lead the people of God astray from the pure worship of the Lord to idolatrous worship (Num. 22:7, 21; 31:16; Rev. 2:14). Balaam knew that what he taught was against God&#8217;s truth and against His people, and he knowingly taught it for gain.<p>In verse 11 Jude also speaks of those who perished in the rebellion of Korah. The Greek word translated &#8220;rebellion&#8221; here literally means contradiction, speaking against. The rebellion of Korah was a rebellion against God&#8217;s deputy authority in His government and His word spoken by His deputy (like Moses). This brings in destruction (Num. 16:1-40). God always speaks through a deputy authority. To rebel against this authority and speaking is, in principle, to be in the rebellion of Korah.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE DEGRADATION OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the remaining aspects of the degradation of the church.<h2 class=head2>P. Having Left the First Love toward the Lord</h2><p>Although the church in Ephesus had many virtues, it was degraded because it had left its first love. In Revelation 2:4 the Lord said, &#8220;I have this against you, that you have left your first love.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;first&#8221; here is the same as the word translated &#8220;best&#8221; in Luke 15:22. Our first love toward the Lord must be the best love for Him. The church in Ephesus had left this best love toward the Lord.<p>The church as the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23) is a matter of life; as the new man (Eph. 2:15), it is a matter of the person of Christ; and as the bride of Christ (John 3:29), it is a matter of love. The first epistle to the Ephesians tells us that for the church life we need to be strengthened in our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that we, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:16-19); and that it is for the church life that grace is with all them who love the Lord Jesus (Eph. 6:24). Now the second epistle to the Ephesians reveals that the degradation of the church begins with our leaving the first love toward the Lord. Nothing but love can keep us in a proper relationship with the Lord. The church in Ephesus had good works, labored for the Lord, endured suffering, and tried the false apostles, but she left her first love toward the Lord.<p>We in the local churches today must be warned of the possibility of losing our first love for the Lord. We may work and labor for the Lord and we may be pure doctrinally and correct scripturally, yet not have the first love for the Lord. Once we have fallen from our first love, our degradation has begun. We may remain the same in everything else-in work, in labor, and in other things-but we are degraded because we have left our first love.<h2 class=head2>Q. Having the Works of the Nicolaitans</h2><p>In Revelation 2:6 the Lord refers to &#8220;the works of the Nicolaitans,&#8221; which He hates. The works of the Nicolaitans refer to a hierarchy among the saints in which some set themselves to rule over others. This brings into being the so-called clergy and laity. In the church of Ephesus there was not the doctrine, the teaching, of the Nicolaitans. This was to develop later. But there were the works and activities of the Nicolaitans, that is, there was some type of clergy and laity.<p>The word &#8220;Nicolaitans&#8221; is an equivalent of the Greek word nikolaitai, the root of which is nikolaos, composed of two Greek words-niko and laos. Niko means conquer or above others. Laos means common people, secular people, or laity. So nikolaos means conquering the common people, climbing above the laity. Nicolaitans, then, must refer to a group who esteem themselves higher than the common believers. This was undoubtedly the hierarchy formed and established by Catholicism and Protestantism. The Lord hates the works of these Nicolaitans, and we must hate what the Lord hates.<p>God in His economy intended that all His people be priests to serve Him directly. In Exodus 19:6 God ordained the children of Israel to become &#8220;a kingdom of priests.&#8221; This means that God wanted them all to be priests. However, because of the worship of the golden calf (Exo. 32:1-6), they lost the priesthood, and only the tribe of Levi, because of their faithfulness to God, was chosen to replace the whole nation of Israel as priests to God (Exo. 32:25-29; Deut. 33:8-10). Hence, there was a mediatorial class between God and the children of Israel. This became a strong system in Judaism. In the New Testament God has returned to His original intention according to His economy in that He has made all believers in Christ priests (Rev. 1:6; 5:10; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). But at the end of the initial church, even in the first century, the Nicolaitans intervened as the mediatorial class to spoil God&#8217;s economy. According to church history, this became a system adopted by the Roman Catholic Church and was also retained by the Protestant churches. Today in the Roman Catholic Church there is the priestly system, in the state churches there is the clerical system, and in the independent churches there is the pastoral system. All these are a mediatorial class, spoiling the universal priesthood of all believers. Thus, there are two distinct classes-the clergy and the laity. But in the proper church life there should be neither clergy nor laity; all believers should be the priests of God. Because the mediatorial class destroys the universal priesthood in God&#8217;s economy, the Lord hates it.<h2 class=head2>R. Becoming in Union with the World Where Satan&#8217;s Throne Is</h2><p>During the first three centuries, the church suffered a great deal as the Roman government tried its best to damage her. Eventually, the enemy, Satan, realized that persecution did not work very well. Therefore, being the subtle one, he changed his strategy from persecuting the church to welcoming her. In the early part of the fourth century, Constantine the Great accepted Christianity and made it a state religion. From that time onward, Christianity became a type of Roman state church. This welcoming of the church by the Roman Empire ruined her, because it caused the church to become worldly. The church has been called out of the world and has been separated from the world to God. However, by being welcomed by the Roman Empire, the church went back to the world and, in the eyes of God, even married the world. God considers this type of worldly union spiritual fornication.<p>In Revelation 2:13 the Lord Jesus said of the church in Pergamos, &#8220;I know where you dwell, where Satan&#8217;s throne is.&#8221; Satan&#8217;s dwelling place is the world. Because the church has entered into union with the world and has become worldly herself, she now dwells where Satan dwells-in the world.<p>The church in Pergamos also dwells where Satan&#8217;s throne is. This again refers to the world. The world is not only Satan&#8217;s dwelling place but also the sphere wherein he rules. Now the church is not only one with the world but even one with Satan. Such a worldly church is saturated with the thoughts, concepts, theories, and practices of Satan.<h2 class=head2>S. Holding the Teaching of Balaam to Eat Idol Sacrifices and to Commit Fornication</h2><p>In Revelation 2:14 the Lord says, &#8220;I have a few things against you, because you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication.&#8221; This verse speaks of &#8220;the teaching of Balaam.&#8221; Balaam was a Gentile prophet who caused God&#8217;s people to stumble. For the sake of reward (2 Pet. 2:15; Jude 11), he brought fornication and idolatry to God&#8217;s people (Num. 25:1-3; 31:16). In the worldly church, some began to teach the same things. Idolatry always brings in fornication (Num. 25:1-3; Acts 15:29). When the worldly church disregarded the name, the person, of the Lord, she turned to idolatry, which issued in fornication. The teachings of Balaam always cause people to enter into union with worldly things. This is to eat idol sacrifices and to commit spiritual fornication.<h2 class=head2>T. Holding the Teaching of the Nicolaitans to Have Hierarchy</h2><p>In Revelation 2:15 the Lord says, &#8220;You also have those who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&#8221; The worldly and degraded church holds not only the teaching of Balaam but also the teaching of the Nicolaitans. The teaching of Balaam distracts the believers from the person of Christ to idolatry and from the enjoyment of Christ to spiritual fornication, whereas the teaching of the Nicolaitans destroys the function of believers as members of the Body of Christ, thus annulling the Lord&#8217;s Body in expressing Him. The former teaching disregards the Head, and the latter destroys the Body.<p>In the church in Ephesus only the works of the Nicolaitans were found (2:6), whereas in the church in Pergamos their works progressed into a teaching. First, they practiced the hierarchy in the initial church; now they taught it in the degraded church. Today in both Catholicism and Protestantism this Nicolaitan hierarchy prevails in both practice and teaching. The Lord hates the Nicolaitan hierarchy because it kills the function of the members of the Body and builds up an organization in place of an organism. This hierarchy is evil and satanic, and the Lord hates it. If we would have the proper church life, we must develop the function of all the members, encouraging them to function according to life in a living way that the Body may be built up as an organism.<h2 class=head2>U. Tolerating the Woman Jezebel, Who Calls Herself a Prophetess, to Teach and Lead the Lord&#8217;s Slaves Astray to Commit Fornication and to Eat Idol Sacrifices, and to Teach the Deep Things of Satan</h2><p>In Revelation 2:20 the Lord says, &#8220;I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices.&#8221; The woman here is the very woman prophesied by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 13:33, the woman who added leaven (signifying evil, heretical, and pagan things) into the fine flour (signifying Christ as the meal offering for the satisfaction of God and man). This woman is also the great prostitute of Revelation 17, who mixes abominations with the divine things. The pagan wife of Ahab, Jezebel, was a type of this apostate church. The apostate church is filled with all manner of fornication and idolatry, both spiritual and physical.<p>In Revelation 2:20 the Lord indicates that the apostate church is a self-appointed prophetess. A prophet is one who speaks for God with God&#8217;s authorization. The apostate church presumes to be authorized by God to speak for God. She demands that people listen to her rather than to God.<p>The church in Pergamos had the teachings of Balaam and of the Nicolaitans, and these are continued in the apostate church signified by the church in Thyatira. Furthermore, the apostate church herself teaches, causing her people to listen to her rather than to the holy Word of God. Her adherents are all drugged by her heretical, religious teaching, not caring for Christ as their life and life supply, as indicated by the tree of life and hidden manna promised by the Lord to the churches in Ephesus and Pergamos (Rev. 2:7, 17).<p>Revelation 2:24 indicates that the apostate church teaches &#8220;the deep things of Satan.&#8221; &#8220;Deep things&#8221; means depths as in Ephesians 3:18. It figuratively denotes mysterious things. The apostate church has many mysteries or deep doctrines. Against the suffering church there was the synagogue of Satan (Rev. 2:9); with the worldly church there was the throne of Satan (2:13); and within the apostate church there are the deep things of Satan. The religion of the synagogue, the world under Satan&#8217;s throne, and the philosophy of the satanic mysteries are all used by Satan to damage and corrupt the church.<p>The church suffered persecution from the synagogue of Satan, and eventually she became worldly, dwelling in the place where Satan dwells and where his throne is. But in Thyatira there is something more serious than this. Now Satan has come into the church and has saturated the church with himself. In the apostate church are the deep things of Satan, the mysterious teachings of Satan. This is the satanic philosophy. The apostate church does teach the satanic mysteries. This indicates that the deep thought of Satan, Satan&#8217;s concept, has saturated the apostate church. Eventually, this church becomes the embodiment of Satan. The proper church is the Body of Christ, but the apostate church is the embodiment of Satan. Christ indwells the church, but Satan indwells the apostate church in a subtle way through the teaching of the deep things of Satan, the mysteries of Satan. The apostate church teaches mysteries, but not the mysteries revealed in the New Testament concerning God&#8217;s economy. Rather, the apostate church teaches the mysteries of Satan.<h2 class=head2>V. Having a Name of Being Living but Actually Being Dead</h2><p>Another aspect of the degradation of the church is that of having a name of being living but actually being dead. In Revelation 3:1 the Lord says, &#8220;I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead.&#8221; Here we see that the church had a name of being living, but the Lord says that she was dead. In her dead condition, she needs the seven living Spirits and the shining stars.<p>In 3:1 the Lord identifies Himself as the One who &#8220;has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars.&#8221; The seven Spirits of God are for the church to be living intensely, and the seven stars are for her to be shining intensely. To the church in Ephesus, Christ is the One who holds the seven stars and walks in the midst of the seven lampstands. The initial church needed the care of Christ, and her leaders needed His keeping grace. To the church in Smyrna, He is the One who became dead and lived again. The suffering church needed the resurrection life of Christ. To the church in Pergamos, Christ is the One who has the sharp two-edged sword. The degraded, worldly church needed His judging and slaying word. To the church in Thyatira, He is the One who has eyes like flaming fire and feet like shining brass. The apostate church needed His searching and judging. Now to the church in Sardis, He is the One who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. Because this church is dead, she needs the sevenfold, intensified Spirit of God and the shining leaders.<h2 class=head2>W. Being Lukewarm and Keeping Christ outside the Door</h2><p>The church in Laodicea prefigures the degraded recovered church. To this church the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish you were cold or hot. So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to vomit you out of My mouth&#8221; (3:15-16). Once the recovered church becomes degraded, it is lukewarm-neither cold nor hot. This should be a warning to us. Once we become lukewarm, we are not fitting for the Lord&#8217;s move and shall be vomited out of His mouth. When the recovered church becomes degraded, she is in danger, unless she repents to be hot in seeking the rich experiences of the Lord, of being vomited out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth. To be vomited out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth is to lose the enjoyment of all that the Lord is to His church.<h2 class=head2>X. Consummating in Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth-the Apostate Christendom</h2><p>All the aspects of the degradation of the church will consummate in &#8220;Babylon the Great, The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth&#8221; (Rev. 17:5). The proper church life will eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem, and the degraded church will consummate in Babylon the Great, that is, into apostate Christendom, which has deviated from God&#8217;s New Testament economy. Whereas the genuine local churches are pure, golden lampstands, today&#8217;s Christendom, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations, and the independent groups, is a great mixture altogether lacking in purity. This mixture constitutes Babylon the Great.<p>Revelation 17:4, speaking of Babylon the Great, says, &#8220;The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication.&#8221; Purple signifies divinity with authority (John 19:2-3). This color is a blend of blue and red; it signifies the blending of heavenly things with earthly. This is the appearance of the apostate church.<p>The woman in verse 4 is &#8220;gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls,&#8221; the materials with which the New Jerusalem is built (Rev. 21:18-19, 21). But the woman, the apostate church, is not solidly built with these precious things as the New Jerusalem is; she is only gilded with these treasures as an ornament for outward display. This is her deception to attract people. It is the prostitute&#8217;s false appearance.<p>The prostitute holds in her hand &#8220;a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication.&#8221; Gold in figure signifies the divine nature, the nature of God. Hence, the golden cup here means that the apostate church does have something of God in appearance. But within, her golden cup is full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication, full of idolatry, pagan practices, and filthiness in a heretical, sinful, religious relationship.<p>Revelation 17:5 goes on to say, &#8220;And upon her forehead a name was written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth.&#8221; Since the Mother of the Prostitutes is the apostate church, the prostitutes, her daughters, should be all the different sects and groups in Christianity who to some extent hold the teachings, practices, and traditions of the apostate Roman Catholic Church. The pure church life has no evil transmitted from the apostate church.<p>The apostate church is the mother of the abominations of the earth. These abominations are idols (Deut. 7:25-26), with which the apostate Roman Church is filled.<p>In Revelation 17:4 and 5 we see the real situation of apostate Christendom. The outward appearance is simply a display. Inwardly, apostate Christendom is filled with things that are abominable in the eyes of God. She is unclean to the uttermost, full of idolatry and fornication. This is the consummation of the degradation of the church.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE OVERCOMERS IN THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>In the foregoing messages we covered the failures in the churches and the degradation in the church. In this message we shall begin to consider the overcomers in the church.<h2 class=head1>XIII. THE OVERCOMERS IN THE CHURCH</h2><p>The Christian life plus the church life is altogether an overcoming life. This matter of overcoming began with our believing in the Lord. Our believing in the Lord was a strong step of overcoming. The entire universe is against people believing in the Lord. Therefore, to believe in the Lord is real overcoming, a real victory.<h2 class=head2>A. Having Overcome through Faith in Christ to Inherit the Eternal Life and to Be the Sons of God for Eternity</h2><p>We overcome through faith in Christ to inherit the eternal life and to be sons of God for eternity. This is revealed in Revelation 21:6b-7. &#8220;I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely. He who overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he shall be a son to Me.&#8221; This word refers to our enjoyment in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth. In the age of eternity we shall enjoy the eternal life, and we shall be sons of God as the composition of the New Jerusalem.<p>The meaning of &#8220;overcome&#8221; in Revelation 21:7 differs from that in chapters two and three of Revelation, where it is used seven times. In 21:7 it means to overcome by believing, as in 1 John 5:4 and 5. The overcoming in Revelation 2 and 3 qualifies the overcoming believers for participation in the enjoyment of the millennial kingdom as a particular reward in God&#8217;s dispensational administration, whereas the overcoming in 21:7 qualifies all believers for participation in the New Jerusalem with all its enjoyment as a common portion of God&#8217;s eternal salvation.<p>The &#8220;son&#8221; in 21:7 is the believer who will dwell in the New Jerusalem. The sons of God in the New Jerusalem are the constituents of the New Jerusalem. They are the regenerated believers who have the divine life and the divine nature. The New Jerusalem is constituted of all these saints who have been born of God, for the New Jerusalem is a composition of all the reborn children of God. Every reborn child of God is a part of this living composition. Because the sons of God are the constituents of the New Jerusalem, they will also dwell in the New Jerusalem.<p>The sons of God will participate in all the enjoyment of the New Jerusalem, especially the enjoyment of the water of life. We should not confuse the enjoyment of the saints with the enjoyment of the nations. The nations will enjoy the common blessing, but the saints will have a particular enjoyment. Mainly, the saints will enjoy the life supply of the water of life (Rev. 22:1).<h2 class=head2>B. Having Overcome the World through Faith in the Son of God</h2><p>The overcomers in the church have overcome the world through faith in the Son of God. First John 5:4 and 5 say, &#8220;Because everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory which overcame the world-our faith. And who is he who overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;world&#8221; in these verses is kosmos. Here it denotes not the earth but an ordered system set up by Satan, the adversary of God. God created man to live on the earth for the fulfillment of His purpose. But His enemy, Satan, in order to usurp the God-created man, has formed an anti-God world system on earth by systematizing men with religion, culture, education, industry, commerce, and entertainment through men&#8217;s fallen nature in their lusts, pleasures, pursuits, and even in their indulgence in living necessities, such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The whole of such a satanic system, which includes all persons, matters, and things, lies in the evil one (1 John 5:19). This system is altogether against God&#8217;s economy, and it opposes the believers in their following of Christ in an absolute way. Therefore, we need to overcome the world.<p>First John 5:4 tells us that &#8220;everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world.&#8221; The word &#8220;everything&#8221; refers to every person who has been begotten of God. Yet such an expression should refer especially to the part that has been regenerated with the divine life, that is, the spirit of the regenerated person (John 3:6). The regenerated spirit of the believer does not practice sin (1 John 3:9), and it overcomes the world. The believer&#8217;s divine birth with the divine life is the basic factor of such a victorious living.<p>We have seen that &#8220;everything&#8221; in 5:4 points to the human spirit. To say that everything begotten of God overcomes the world actually means that it is the regenerated human spirit that overcomes the world. Regarding overcoming the world, we should not trust in our own ability or effort. On the contrary, we need to trust our regenerated spirit. In ourselves we cannot overcome the world. However, our regenerated spirit is well able to overcome the world, the evil satanic system. When we exercise our spirit, stay in our spirit, and walk by our spirit, we shall see that our spirit has the life ability to overcome all negative things. This is why we need to exercise our spirit to have fellowship with the Lord and pray concerning the enjoyment of the Lord. We also need to exercise our spirit to call on the Lord&#8217;s name and to pray-read the Word. This exercise stirs up the ability in our spirit to overcome the world.<p>It is the divine life in our spirit that has the ability to overcome the world. The divine life in our spirit can overcome the temptations that surround us. We all need to see that our spirit is mingled with the divine life and is the organ that can overcome the world.<p>First John 5:4b says, &#8220;This is the victory which overcame the world-our faith.&#8221; This is the faith that believes that Jesus is the Son of God (5:5) that we may be begotten of God and have the divine life, by which we are enabled to overcome the Satan-organized-and-usurped world.<p>Actually, our trust should not be in our faith itself. The faith by itself does not overcome the world. Our faith brings us into an organic union with the processed Triune God, and it is this organic union, not the faith directly, that overcomes the world. By believing in the Lord Jesus, we are brought into an organic union with the Triune God. This union, produced by faith, then overcomes the world.<p>First John 5:5 goes on to say, &#8220;And who is he who overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?&#8221; Such a believer is one who has been begotten of God and has received the divine life (John 1:12-13; 3:16). The divine life empowers him to overcome the evil world energized by Satan. Such believers are in contrast to those who remain the pitiful victims of the evil satanic system. Our believing that Jesus is the Son of God brings us into an organic union with the Son, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. It is this organic union with the Triune God in the Son that overcomes the world.<h2 class=head2>C. Having Overcome the Evil One</h2><p>First John 2:13 and 14 speak of the overcoming of the evil one. &#8220;I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, young children, because you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;evil one&#8221; is poneros. This word differs from kakos, which refers to an essentially worthless and wicked character; it also differs from sapros, which indicates worthlessness and corruption, degeneracy from original virtue. The word poneros denotes one who is pernicious, harmfully evil, affecting and influencing others to be evil and vicious. Such an evil one is Satan, the Devil, in whom the whole world lies.<p>According to 1 John 2:13 and 14, the believers who are &#8220;young men&#8221; overcome the evil one. These are the believers who have grown up in the divine life. One characteristic of these grown-up and strong believers is that they overcome the evil one. This is possible because the young men are nourished, strengthened, and sustained by the word of God which abides in them and operates in them against the Devil, the world, and its lusts. Overcoming the evil one is a strong evidence that a believer has grown to be a young man.<p>Concerning the young men, in 2:14 John says not only that they have overcome the evil one, but also that they are strong and that the word of God abides in them. The word ending with &#8220;abides in you&#8221; strengthens the word &#8220;you have overcome,&#8221; which was written in the previous verse to the young men. Many in the church life are strong young men who have overcome the evil one and who have the word of God abiding in them. Through the word of God that abides in them, they are strengthened, nourished, sustained, and invigorated.<p>By overcoming the world the believers also overcome the evil one, Satan, who has formed the satanic world system and who is now instigating the world to rise up against the followers of the Lord Jesus.<h2 class=head2>D. Having Overcome the Antichrists through the Indwelling Christ</h2><p>First John 4:3 and 4 say, &#8220;Every spirit which does not confess Jesus, is not out of God; and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now is already in the world. You are out of God, little children, and you have overcome them, because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.&#8221; These verses indicate that the overcomers in the church have also overcome the antichrists through the indwelling Christ. There are many antichrists. Among the antichrists, the strongest and greatest one will be the Antichrist, who will rise up during the last years of the church age. But before his coming, there will be many antichrists, such as the Modernists, who deny the deity of Christ. Whoever brings in something as a factor and element of the degradation of the church is an antichrist. We must overcome the antichrists, not participating in their teachings, practices, or activities.<p>According to 1 John 4:3, the spirit which does not confess Jesus is not out of God, but is the spirit of antichrist. This is the spirit of a false prophet actuated by the spirit of deception, the spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.<p>In 4:4 John continues, &#8220;You are out of God, little children, and you have overcome them, because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.&#8221; The believers are &#8220;out of God&#8221; because they have been begotten of God (1 John 4:7; 2:29; 3:9). Those who are overcome are the false prophets (4:1), the antichrists, those who teach heresy concerning Christ&#8217;s person. The believers have overcome them by abiding in the truth concerning Christ&#8217;s deity and concerning His humanity through divine conception, according to the teaching of the divine anointing (2:27).<p>In 4:4 John tells the believers that He who is in them is greater than he who is in the world. The One in the believers is the Triune God who dwells in the believers as the all-inclusive, life-giving, anointing Spirit, and who strengthens them from within with all the rich elements of the Triune God (Eph. 3:16-19). Such a One is much greater and stronger than Satan, the evil spirit.<p>The words &#8220;he who is in the world&#8221; in 1 John 4:4 refer to Satan, the fallen angel. Satan as the evil spirit usurps fallen mankind and operates in evil persons, who are the components of his world system. Such a one is less than the Triune God and weaker than He is.<h2 class=head2>E. Having Overcome All the Degradations of the Degraded Churches</h2><p>The overcomers have overcome all the degradations of the degraded churches spoken of in Revelation 2:4, 6, 13, 14, 15, 20, 24; 3:1,15, 20a, and 17:5. During the degradation and desolation of the church, in order to maintain and continue the church&#8217;s testimony concerning Christ that the church may be recovered to her original state, the need to have the overcomers is a pressing matter, and it is something of the Lord&#8217;s desire. For this reason, at the end of each of the seven epistles which the Lord wrote to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, He consistently sounds out a serious call to the overcomers. Throughout the generations there have been many believers who have answered His call and have been strong to rise up to spread the Lord&#8217;s testimony and the church&#8217;s recovery.<p>Let us now briefly consider the degradations of the churches that need to be overcome. In Revelation 2:4 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I have this against you, that you have left your first love.&#8221; The degradation of the church begins with the leaving of the first love, the best love, for the Lord. The church in Ephesus had good works, labored for the Lord, endured suffering, and tried the false apostles. However, she left her first love for the Lord. Leaving the first love is the origin of the church&#8217;s degradation. Therefore, we should not allow anything to separate us from the love of the Lord. We must take care of the first love and constantly love the Lord.<p>Revelation 2:6 speaks of &#8220;the works of the Nicolaitans,&#8221; which the Lord hates. The Nicolaitans are those who esteem themselves higher than the common believers. They regard themselves as the &#8220;clergy&#8221; as opposed to the &#8220;laity.&#8221; However, in the proper church life there should be neither clergy nor laity, for all believers should be the priests of God.<p>Revelation 2:13 says, &#8220;I know where you dwell, where Satan&#8217;s throne is; and you hold fast My name, and you have not denied My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.&#8221; This verse speaks of &#8220;where Satan&#8217;s throne is,&#8221; and &#8220;where Satan dwells.&#8221; Satan&#8217;s throne is in the world, where he dwells. Because the worldly church entered into union with the world, she dwells where Satan dwells.<p>Revelation 2:14 says, &#8220;I have a few things against you, because you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication.&#8221; Balaam was a Gentile prophet who brought fornication and idolatry to God&#8217;s people (Num. 25:1-3; 31:16). In the worldly church signified by the church in Pergamos, some began to teach the same things.<p>Idolatry always brings in fornication (Num. 25:1-3; Acts 15:29). When the worldly church disregarded the name, the person, of the Lord, she turned to idolatry, which issued in fornication.<p>In verse 15 the Lord goes on to speak of &#8220;the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&#8221; The teaching of the Nicolaitans destroys the function of the believers as members of the Body of Christ, thus annulling the Lord&#8217;s Body in expressing Him. In the church in Ephesus only the works of the Nicolaitans were found, whereas in the church in Pergamos their works progressed into a teaching. Today, in both Catholicism and Protestantism, the Nicolaitan hierarchy prevails in both practice and teaching.<p>In Revelation 2:20 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices.&#8221; This woman is the same as the one prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33, the woman who added leaven (signifying evil, heretical, and pagan things) into the fine flour (signifying Christ as the meal offering for the satisfaction of God and man). This woman is the great prostitute of Revelation 17, who mixes abominations with the divine things. The pagan wife of Ahab, Jezebel, was a type of this apostate church.<p>Revelation 3:1 says, &#8220;To the messenger of the church in Sardis write: These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead.&#8221; The church in Sardis, which signifies the reformed Protestant Church, is living in name but dead in actuality. Hence, there is the need of the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. The seven Spirits of God are for the church to be living intensely, and the seven stars are for her to be shining intensely.<p>&#8220;I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish you were cold or hot&#8221; (Rev. 3:15). This is the Lord&#8217;s word to the church in Laodicea, which signifies the degraded recovered church. Concerning the condition of this church, the Lord says, &#8220;Because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to vomit you out of My mouth&#8221; (v. 16). This warns us that once we become lukewarm, we are not fitting for the Lord&#8217;s move and shall be vomited out of His mouth.<p>Revelation 3:20 says, &#8220;Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me.&#8221; Here we see that the Lord as the Head of the church is standing outside the degraded church, knocking at her door. The degraded recovered church must realize this! Such a church needs to realize that although she has knowledge, she does not have the presence of the Lord.<p>Revelation 17:5, speaking of the &#8220;woman sitting on a scarlet beast&#8221; (v. 3), says, &#8220;upon her forehead a name was written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth.&#8221; &#8220;Mystery&#8221; here indicates that Babylon the Great in this chapter is not the material one, as in chapter eighteen, but the religious one. Religious Babylon, the apostate church, is truly mysterious in what she is, in what she practices, and in what she teaches.<p>Since the &#8220;Mother of the Prostitutes&#8221; is the apostate church, the prostitutes, her daughters, should be all the different sects and groups in Christianity who hold, to some extent, the teaching, practices, and traditions of the apostate Roman Church. The pure church life has no evil transmitted from the apostate church.<p>In this message we have covered five matters that need to be overcome: the situation that frustrates us from believing in the Lord; the world, which is against our following the Lord to the end of our life; Satan, the one who formed the satanic system and who instigates people to be against the believers; the antichrists, those who teach heresy concerning the person of Christ; and all the degradations in the church. If we overcome all these things, we truly are the overcomers, those who have overcome the situation that opposes our believing in Christ to have eternal life and to become sons of God and who have overcome the world, Satan, the antichrists, and all the degradations of degraded Christendom.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE OVERCOMERS IN THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover four aspects of the overcomers in the church: the dead overcomers, the living overcomers, the overcomers as the bride at the marriage feast of Christ and in the millennium, and the overcomers as the armies in heaven fighting with the coming Christ against Antichrist and his armies.<h2 class=head2>F. The Dead Overcomers- the Man-child within the Woman</h2><p>The believers may be overcomers either as the man-child (the dead overcomers) or as the firstfruit (the living overcomers). The dead overcomers are the man-child within the woman in Revelation 12. Verse 5 says, &#8220;She brought forth a son, a man-child, who was about to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.&#8221; In the Bible the woman signifies the weaker one and the man the stronger one (1 Pet. 3:7). Hence, the man-child in Revelation 12:5 signifies the stronger part of God&#8217;s people. Throughout all generations there have been some stronger ones among God&#8217;s people. These are considered in the Bible a collective unit fighting the battle for God and bringing God&#8217;s kingdom down to earth.<p>The fact that the man-child &#8220;was about to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod&#8221; indicates that the man-child consists of the overcomers, as mentioned in 2:26-27. Furthermore, &#8220;brought forth&#8221; in 12:5 signifies resurrection, as in Acts 13:33 and 34.<p>The man-child is composed of the dead overcoming saints resurrected. This is proved by the words &#8220;unto death&#8221; in Revelation 12:11. All the overcomers who die will be part of the man-child. By resurrection the man-child will come into full existence. Abel, who was the first martyr, the Apostles, and all the martyrs and deceased overcomers are waiting for the time of resurrection. The resurrection of all the dead overcoming believers will be the delivery of the man-child. Therefore, the man-child is composed of all the overcoming saints who die before the time of this resurrection.<p>A believer who is an overcomer today and lives until the Lord Jesus comes back will not be part of the man-child but may be among the firstfruit. However, a believer who is an overcomer and dies before the Lord Jesus comes back will be resurrected to be part of the man-child. The man-child in Revelation 12:5 does not represent the overcomers who live until the Lord comes back, but represents all the dead overcomers who will be resurrected before the Lord comes back. This resurrection will be their delivery as the man-child.<h2 class=head3>1. Comprising the Overcomers of Both the Old Testament and the New Testament</h2><p>The dead overcomers, the man-child within the woman, comprise the overcomers of both the Old Testament and the New Testament (Heb. 11:33, 39-40). All these overcomers as a totality are the man-child. As Hebrews 11:39 and 40 indicate, the overcomers in the Old Testament dispensation need the overcomers in the New Testament to be their completion, their complement. This means that the New Testament overcomers will match them in victory over all negative things. Eventually, in the millennium, all will join together to enter into the feast of the kingdom.<h2 class=head3>2. To Be Resurrected and Raptured to the Throne of God before the Great Tribulation</h2><p>The dead overcomers through all the generations will be resurrected and raptured to God and to His throne. Revelation 12:5 tells us that the man-child &#8220;was caught up to God and to His throne.&#8221; To be &#8220;caught up&#8221; is to be raptured. The rapture of the man-child differs from that of the majority of the believers as mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4:17. There, the rapture of the majority of the believers will be to the air, whereas the rapture of the man-child, the dead overcomers resurrected, will be to the throne of God in the heavens.<p>The dead overcomers will be raptured to God and to His throne before the period of the great tribulation, that is, before the three and a half years, the twelve hundred sixty days. The rapture of the man-child is in Revelation 12:5. Verse 6 goes on to speak of &#8220;a thousand two hundred and sixty days,&#8221; and verse 14 of &#8220;time, and times, and half a time,&#8221; which denotes three and a half years. From this we see that the man-child, comprising the dead overcomers through all the generations, will be raptured before the great tribulation.<h2 class=head2>G. The Living Overcomers- the Firstfruit of God&#8217;s Harvest on the Earth</h2><p>The living overcomers will be the firstfruit of God&#8217;s harvest on the earth (Rev. 14:4). God has a harvest on earth, and this harvest is growing in the field. The growth is taking place in the church life, which today is God&#8217;s farm (1 Cor. 3:9). Also, the church itself is the harvest. In this harvest some are growing faster and will ripen earlier. These will be the firstfruit at the time of the Lord&#8217;s coming.<p>Revelation 14:1 says, &#8220;I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.&#8221; Verse 4b goes on to explain, &#8220;These were purchased from among men as firstfruit to God and to the Lamb.&#8221; The firstfruit to God and to the Lamb are those of God&#8217;s crop who mature the earliest. These early overcomers will be the first ripe ones in God&#8217;s field. Hence, they will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruit to God and to the Lamb. According to verses 14 through 16, the harvest will be reaped later. This means that the firstfruit will be raptured to the heavens before the harvest, just as the firstfruit of the good land was reaped and brought into the temple of God before the harvest. The crucial matter concerning the firstfruit is the principle that among the believers living on earth at the time of the Lord&#8217;s coming back, some will ripen early and, being the first to mature, will become the firstfruit in God&#8217;s field.<h2 class=head3>1. Comprising Only the New Testament Overcomers Who Live until the Lord&#8217;s Coming Back</h2><p>The living overcomers, the firstfruit of God&#8217;s harvest, will comprise only the New Testament overcomers who live until the Lord&#8217;s coming back. This is indicated by Matthew 24:39b-41, which says, &#8220;So also shall the coming of the Son of Man be. Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.&#8221; &#8220;To be taken&#8221; means to be raptured. The two men in verse 40 must be brothers in Christ, and the two women in verse 41 must be sisters in the Lord. This is indicated by verse 42, which tells us to watch because we do not know on what day the Lord comes. Both &#8220;watch therefore&#8221; and &#8220;your Lord&#8221; prove that the two men and the two women in these verses are believers. Of the two men in the field, one is taken and the other is left; and of the two women grinding at the mill, one is taken and the other is left. The reason for this is that there is a difference between them in the matter of life. I believe that the one taken is mature and that the one left is immature. The growth in life to maturity makes the difference.<h2 class=head3>2. To Be Raptured to Mount Zion in the Heavens before the Great Tribulation</h2><p>The firstfruit will be raptured to mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation. The Zion in Revelation 14:1 is not the earthly one but the one in the heavens (Heb. 12:22). The events recorded in Revelation 14:6-13, all of which will take place during the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), indicate clearly and prove strongly that the first overcomers as the firstfruit will be raptured before the great tribulation and that the harvest in Revelation 14:14-16, which includes the majority of believers, will be raptured toward the end of the great tribulation.<p>Revelation 3:10 also refers to this rapture. &#8220;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.&#8221; &#8220;Trial&#8221; in this verse undoubtedly denotes the great tribulation. The Lord promises the overcoming believers that He will keep them &#8220;out of the hour of trial&#8221; (not just out of the trial but out of the hour of trial) because they have kept the word of His endurance, the word of His suffering. This promise of the Lord indicates that the believers who have kept the word of the Lord&#8217;s endurance will be raptured before the great tribulation. This implies that those who have not kept the word of His endurance will be left in the tribulation.<p>Luke 21:36 says that some believers will &#8220;prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.&#8221; &#8220;All these things&#8221; are the things of the great tribulation. The word &#8220;escape&#8221; signifies being taken, raptured, before the great tribulation. Here the Lord promises that if we are watchful and beseeching so that we may overcome to escape (or, are counted worthy to escape) the coming tribulation, we shall be raptured to, will be placed in, His presence. This is what it means &#8220;to stand before the Son of Man.&#8221; This verse is a further indication that the living overcomers will be raptured before the great tribulation.<h2 class=head3>3. For the Satisfaction to God and Christ</h2><p>The firstfruit of God&#8217;s crop will be raptured to mount Zion in the heavens for God and Christ&#8217;s satisfaction. Here we see the difference between the man-child in Revelation 12 and the firstfruit in Revelation 14. The man-child is for fighting and for defeating Satan. The firstfruit is not for fighting but for the satisfaction of God and Christ. God and Christ need enjoyment. The living overcomers will be the firstfruit to satisfy this need for enjoyment. The enemy, the Devil, in heaven must be cast down by the man-child, who will execute the Lord&#8217;s judgment over him. But there is another need in the heavens-God and Christ must be satisfied through having fresh enjoyment. God and Christ are hungry and thirsty, desiring some firstfruit to taste for Their satisfaction. If we realize this, we shall desire to ripen earlier for the satisfaction of God and Christ. The earliest ones, the firstfruit, of God&#8217;s crop to mature are for the enjoyment of God and Christ.<h2 class=head2>H. To Be the Bride at the Marriage Feast of Christ and in the Millennium</h2><p>All the overcomers, both the dead and the living, will be the bride at the marriage feast of Christ and in the millennium (Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2). This means that at His coming back Christ will marry the overcoming believers.<p>Revelation 19:7 says, &#8220;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready.&#8221; The marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. God&#8217;s economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age. Then the bride, consisting of the overcoming believers, will be ready.<p>The words &#8220;His wife&#8221; in Revelation 19:7 refer to the church (Eph. 5:24-25, 31-32), the bride of Christ (John 3:29). However, according to Revelation 19:8 and 9, the wife, the bride of Christ, in verse .7 consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium, whereas the bride, the wife, in Revelation 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity. The readiness of the bride in 19:7 depends on the maturity in life of the overcomers. Furthermore, the overcomers are not separate individuals but a corporate bride. The overcomers are not only mature in life but are also built together as one bride.<p>Revelation 19:8 says, &#8220;It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.&#8221; &#8220;Pure&#8221; refers to the nature, whereas &#8220;bright&#8221; refers to the expression. The Greek word translated &#8220;righteousnesses&#8221; may also be rendered &#8220;righteous acts.&#8221; These righteousnesses do not refer to the righteousness (which is Christ) we received for our salvation (1 Cor. 1:30), a righteousness that is objective so that we may meet the requirement of the righteous God. The righteousnesses of the overcoming believers in Revelation 19:8 are subjective so that they may meet the requirements of the overcoming Christ. Hence, the fine linen indicates our overcoming life, our overcoming living. This is actually the Christ whom we live out of our being.<h2 class=head2>I. To Be the Armies in Heaven Fighting with the Coming Christ against Antichrist and His Armies</h2><p>The overcomers will also be the armies in heaven fighting with the coming Christ against Antichrist and his armies (Rev. 17:12-14; 19:11-21). Christ&#8217;s armies are composed of His called, chosen, and faithful ones. &#8220;He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him are called and chosen and faithful&#8221; (Rev. 17:14). Here we see that those with Christ are called, chosen, and faithful. It is significant that &#8220;chosen&#8221; is mentioned after &#8220;called.&#8221; To be called is to be saved, but to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord on the basis of an overcoming life. Many are called today, but few will be chosen in the future (Matt. 22:14). We all have been called. In order to be among the chosen in the future, we need to live an overcoming life today. In Revelation 17:14 the chosen ones are those faithful to the Lord who will become His armies.<p>Revelation 19:14 tells us that those in the Lord&#8217;s armies are &#8220;dressed in fine linen, white and pure.&#8221; This fine linen is the garment of the overcoming believers that qualifies them both to attend the marriage feast of Christ and to fight with Him against His enemy. Thus, the wedding garment becomes the fighting garment. The &#8220;fine linen, white and pure&#8221; qualifies the overcomers not only to attend the wedding feast but also to be in the armies. The overcomers who follow Christ to fight against His enemy will be properly formed heavenly armies.<p>The heavenly armies following the Lord will fight against Antichrist and the false prophet and their armies and destroy them. Revelation 19:19 says, &#8220;I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army.&#8221; Christ&#8217;s enemies are the beast. Antichrist (undoubtedly including his associate, the false prophet), and the kings of the earth and their armies. The kings of the earth especially include the ten kings under Antichrist (Rev. 17:12-14), and the armies include the two hundred million cavalry troops from the rising of the sun (Rev. 9:16; 16:12). Christ and His armies will defeat Antichrist and his armies. Christ as the King of kings and the Lord of lords with His armies, composed of the overcoming believers, will defeat Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE OVERCOMERS IN THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover further aspects of the overcomers in the church. We shall see that the overcomers will reign with Christ and be priests of God and Christ in the millennium, that they will inherit the kingdom of Christ and of God to enter the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, and that they will be glorified with Christ.<h2 class=head2>J. To Reign with Christ and to Be Priests of God and Christ in the Millennium</h2><p>In the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ. Revelation 20:4b says, &#8220;They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.&#8221; Verse 6b tells us, &#8220;They shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years.&#8221; Furthermore, in 2 Timothy 2:12a Paul says, &#8220;If we endure, we shall also reign with Him.&#8221; These verses indicate that in the coming manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ as His co-kings and that they will be priests of God and of Christ.<p>Some today teach that all the believers will be kings and priests in the millennium. This teaching is not accurate. During the millennium only the overcoming Christians, not all the believers, will be kings and priests. Those who will reign with Christ in the millennial kingdom are those who live in the reality of the kingdom today. Then, in the coming age, they will be in the manifestation of the kingdom.<h2 class=head3>1. To Be Crowned</h2><p>As the co-kings with Christ, the overcomers will be crowned with a number of crowns. These crowns include the crown of righteousness, the unfading crown of glory, the crown of life, and an incorruptible crown.<h2 class=head4>a. With the Crown of Righteousness</h2><p>In 2 Timothy 4:8 Paul says, &#8220;There is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me in that day; and not only to me, but also to all those who have loved His appearing.&#8221; The crown is a symbol of glory given as a prize, in addition to the Lord&#8217;s salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race (1 Cor. 9:25). This prize is neither of grace nor by faith as salvation is (Eph. 2:5, 8-9); rather, this prize is of righteousness through works (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 2 Cor. 5:10). Such a reward will be awarded to the believers not according to the grace of the Lord, but according to His righteousness. Hence, it is a crown of righteousness. The One who awards it is the Lord as the righteous Judge, not as the merciful God or the gracious Redeemer. Paul was assured that such a prize was reserved, laid up, for him and would be awarded to him at the day of the Lord&#8217;s second appearing.<p>Paul says that such an award will be given to all who love the Lord&#8217;s appearing. The Lord&#8217;s appearing, His coming back, is a warning, an encouragement, and an incentive to us. We should love it and look forward to it with earnest expectation and joy.<h2 class=head4>b. With the Unfading Crown of Glory</h2><p>First Peter 5:4 says, &#8220;When the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.&#8221; At Peter&#8217;s time, crowns were given to victors in athletic games and warfare (1 Cor. 9:25; 2 Tim. 4:8). Those were corruptible crowns, whose glory faded. The crown given by the Lord to the overcomers will be a reward to them. The glory of this crown will never fade. It will be a portion of the glory for the overcomers&#8217; enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and Christ (2 Pet. 1:11).<h2 class=head4>c. With the Crown of Life</h2><p>In Revelation 2:10b the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.&#8221; A crown in New Testament usage always denotes a prize in addition to salvation. The crown of life as a prize to those who are faithful unto death in overcoming persecution denotes the overcoming strength which is the power of the resurrection life (Phil. 3:10); it also signifies that these overcomers have attained to &#8220;the out-resurrection from among the dead,&#8221; that is, the outstanding resurrection (Phil. 3:11).<h2 class=head4>d. With an Incorruptible Crown</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 9:25 Paul says, &#8220;Everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; those, therefore, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.&#8221; The incorruptible crown, which the Lord will award His overcoming saints who win the race, is a reward in addition to salvation. As believers, we have all received His salvation through faith in Him. This has been settled once for all. But whether we shall be rewarded by Him depends on how we run the race. Here in 1 Corinthians 9 the apostle is running the course. In Philippians, one of his last Epistles, he was still running (Phil. 3:14). It was not until the last moment of his running, in 2 Timothy 4:6-8, that Paul had the assurance that he would be rewarded by the Lord at His appearing. With this prize in view, the apostle charged the believers to run the race so that they might obtain the reward.<h2 class=head3>2. To Sit with Christ on His Throne</h2><p>In Revelation 3:21 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.&#8221; To sit with the Lord on His throne will be a prize to the overcomer that he may participate in the Lord&#8217;s authority in the coming millennial kingdom. This means that the overcomers will be co-kings with Christ ruling over the whole earth.<p>A verse that we should consider in relation to Revelation 3:21 is Matthew 19:28. Here the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&#8221; The regeneration is the restoration of the coming kingdom age (Acts 3:21) after the Lord&#8217;s second coming. In the coming kingdom, the overcomers will sit on thrones to reign over the earth (Rev. 20:4). The first twelve apostles, including Peter, will judge the twelve tribes of Israel, while the others will rule over the nations (Rev. 2:26).<h2 class=head3>3. To Have Authority over the Nations and Shepherd Them</h2><p>In the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcomers will rule, have authority over, the nations and shepherd them. In Revelation 2:26 and 27 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;He who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations, and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father.&#8221; This is a prize to the overcomers of reigning with Christ over the nations in the millennial kingdom. This promise of the Lord strongly implies that those who do not answer His call to the overcomers will not participate in the reign of the millennial kingdom. In Psalm 2:9 God gave Christ authority to rule over the nations. In the coming kingdom Christ will give the same authority to the overcomers.<p>Revelation 12:5 tells us that the man-child &#8220;was about to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.&#8221; In the millennial kingdom the ruler will be a shepherd. The iron rod in this verse is the authority of Christ which He gives the overcomers. The overcomers will exercise the authority of Christ over the nations and rule them with Christ in the millennial kingdom.<p>In the Lord&#8217;s teaching about faithfulness in Luke 19:11-27, He indicates that the overcomers will rule over the nations. Verse 17 says, &#8220;Well done, good slave; because you became faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities.&#8221; In verse 19 He says, &#8220;And you, be over five cities.&#8221; Having authority over ten cities or five cities signifies the overcomers&#8217; reigning over the nations. Furthermore, these verses indicate that the overcoming believers&#8217; reigning in the coming kingdom as a reward will differ in extent.<p>In Matthew 25:21 and 23 the Lord says to the overcomer, &#8220;I will set you over many things.&#8221; &#8220;Over&#8221; signifies the ruling authority in the coming kingdom, and &#8220;many things&#8221; signify the responsibilities in the coming kingdom.<h2 class=head3>4. To Participate in the Joy of the Lord</h2><p>In Matthew 25 the Lord Jesus twice says, &#8220;Enter into the joy of your lord&#8221; (vv. 21b, 23b). &#8220;The joy of your lord&#8221; signifies the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming kingdom. When the Lord Jesus comes back, that will be the time for Him to enjoy the earth. Satan will be bound, Christ will recover the earth, and the entire earth will be under His reign. By repossessing the earth, the Lord will have His enjoyment. Then He will invite His followers, His partners, to participate in this enjoyment, to enter into His joy.<p>The overcomers will be crowned, sit with Christ on His throne, have authority over the nations and shepherd them, and also participate in the joy of the Lord. On the one hand, they will be seated with Christ on His throne to have authority over the nations; on the other hand, they will enter into the joy of the Lord. Entering into the Lord&#8217;s joy is greater than being crowned and having authority over the nations. The joy of the Lord will be the greatest thing in the millennium.<h2 class=head2>K. To Inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God to Enter the Manifestation of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>In Ephesians 5:5b Paul speaks of a believer&#8217;s &#8220;inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.&#8221; The kingdom of Christ is the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 16:28); it is also the kingdom of God (Matt. 13:41, 43). The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God (John 3:5) and in the church life they are living in the kingdom of God today (Rom. 14:17). However, not all believers will participate in the millennium; only the overcoming believers will. The defeated believers will have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God in the coming age.<p>The term &#8220;the kingdom of Christ and of God&#8221; refers not to the kingdom today in the church life but to the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming millennium. The millennium will be a kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today. Only in the millennium will the kingdom of Christ also become the kingdom of God. Today all believers are in the kingdom of God but not all of them will have an inheritance in the coming millennial kingdom. Both the defeated ones and the overcoming ones may be in the church as the kingdom of God, but only the overcomers will inherit the kingdom during the millennium.<p>In 1 Corinthians 6:10b Paul speaks of inheriting the kingdom of God. The word &#8220;inherit&#8221; here implies enjoyment. To inherit a certain thing is to enjoy that thing. Hence, to inherit the coming kingdom means to enjoy the kingdom. The coming kingdom will be a joyful inheritance to the overcomers. According to Matthew, the manifestation of the kingdom will be a reward to the overcoming saints as their enjoyment with the Lord. To inherit the kingdom is not just to enter the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment. This should be an incentive for us to live an overcoming life. By living an overcoming life today we shall be qualified to inherit the coming kingdom as a reward.<p>In Galatians 5:21 Paul, referring to the works of the flesh, says, &#8220;Those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.&#8221; The inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers. It is not related to a believer&#8217;s salvation. Those believers who practice the works of the flesh listed in Galatians 5 will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward.<p>Second Peter 1:11 says, &#8220;So shall be richly and bountifully supplied to you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&#8221; The bountiful supply we enjoy in the development of the divine life and divine nature will bountifully supply us a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord. It will enable and qualify us to enter into the coming kingdom with all the riches of the divine life and divine nature as our excellent virtues unto the splendid glory of God.<p>The eternal kingdom in 2 Peter 1:11 refers to the kingdom of God given to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (Dan. 7:13-14), which will be manifested at His coming back (Luke 19:11-12). It will be a reward to His faithful believers who pursue the growth in His life unto maturity and the development of the virtues of His nature, so that they may participate, in the millennium, in His kingship in God&#8217;s glory (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6). To enter thus into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to the entrance into God&#8217;s eternal glory, to which He has called us in Christ (1 Pet. 5:10; 1 Thes. 2:12).<p>The overcomers will inherit the kingdom of Christ and of God to enter the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5:20; 7:21; 2 Tim. 4:18). With the kingdom of the heavens there are three aspects: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward contents of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature, as revealed in Matthew 5-7. The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward state of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed in Matthew 13. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power, as revealed by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 24 and 25. Both the reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church today. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will begin with the coming back of the Lord Jesus. When the Lord comes back, the kingdom of the heavens will be manifested. Whereas the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens includes all of the false believers, only the victorious, overcoming believers are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. After the Lord Jesus comes back, these overcoming believers will participate in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.<h2 class=head2>L. To Be Glorified with Christ</h2><p>The overcomers will also be glorified with Christ. Romans 8:17b says, &#8220;If indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.&#8221; Glory is the expression of God. Christ, the hope of glory (Col. 1:27), has been sown into us as the seed of glory and this seed will grow until it reaches the stage of blossoming, at which time the glory will come out. For God to glorify us means that the glory which has been sown into us saturates our whole being and is expressed through us. When our entire being has been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, that glory will come out of us. This is what it means for the believers to be glorified.<p>The believers&#8217; glorification will not be an accident. Rather, their glorification will be the issue of their maturity in life. First, we are regenerated, and then we are gradually transformed through the growth of the divine life within us. As the divine life grows within us, it saturates us with the divine element, and this element changes us metabolically. This metabolic change is what the New Testament calls transformation. Glorification is the issue of transformation, and transformation is accomplished by the gradual and continuous growth in life. One day, when we reach our maturity, we shall be glorified and thereby brought into the full expression of the Triune God.<p>In Romans 8:17 Paul points out that if we suffer with Christ, we shall also be glorified with Him. Although we should not say that without suffering we shall not be glorified, it is certain that the degree of our suffering determines the degree of our glory. The more suffering we pass through, the more our glory will be intensified, for suffering increases the intensity of our glory. We want to be glorified, but we may not want to experience suffering. However, suffering increases glory. Eventually, we all shall shine and be glorified, but the intensity of our glory will depend on the amount of suffering we are willing to take. Realizing this, Paul went on to say in Romans 8:18, &#8220;For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us.&#8221; The present suffering means nothing compared with the coming glory.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE OVERCOMERS IN THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the overcomers in the church.<h2 class=head2>M. To Inherit Eternal Life in the Millennium</h2><p>In Matthew 19:29 the Lord Jesus speaks of inheriting eternal life. The overcomers will inherit eternal life in the millennium. To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded in the coming age with the enjoyment of the divine life in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. Certain believers who have received eternal life enjoy it to some extent; however, they do not enjoy it to the proper extent. As a result, when the Lord Jesus comes back at the time of the manifestation of the kingdom, they will miss the enjoyment of the millennial kingdom. To miss the enjoyment of the divine life in the coming kingdom is to miss the enjoyment of eternal life during that dispensation.<p>When the overcoming believers participate in the coming kingdom, they will inherit eternal life and thereby have a fuller enjoyment of the divine life. In the manifestation of the kingdom, the overcoming believers will participate in the enjoyment of eternal life with the Lord Jesus. In the church life today we are enjoying the divine life, the eternal life, but this enjoyment is not in full. In the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcomers will enjoy the eternal life in a fuller way. The overcomers, therefore, will be the first group of believers to enjoy eternal life in full.<h2 class=head3>1. To Have Their Names Remain in the Book of Life</h2><p>For the overcomers to inherit eternal life in the millennium is to have their names remain in the book of life. In Revelation 3:5 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;He who overcomes, he shall be clothed in white garments, and I will by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.&#8221; The name being erased out of the book of life indicates that the name was already written in the book of life. The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings God has prepared for them. The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book (Luke 10:20). These blessings are in three stages: the church, the millennial kingdom, and eternity. The blessings in the stage of the church, such as forgiveness, redemption, regeneration, eternal life, and the divine nature, are all the initial portions. All God&#8217;s chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life. If they cooperate with God&#8217;s supplying grace, they will mature in life in the church age, and this earlier maturity in life will constitute a prize with which the Lord will reward them at His coming back. However, those who do not mature in life in the church age will not be ready at the Lord&#8217;s coming back to enter into the millennial kingdom and share in the divine blessing of that age as a prize. Therefore, during the millennial kingdom their names will be erased from the book of life. After being disciplined by the Lord and growing in life unto maturity during the millennial kingdom, they will share in the divine blessings in the stage of eternity. Then their names should be written in the book of life again. This means that all God&#8217;s chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life and who have been brought into the participation of the divine blessings in the stage of the church shall &#8220;by no means perish to the age&#8221; (John 10:28, lit.), that is, they shall by no means lose the divine blessing of eternity. But some, who will not cooperate with the Lord in the church age, will be dispensationally disciplined by the Lord during the millennial kingdom and will miss the divine blessings in that stage. However, the names of those who have lived an overcoming life in the church age will remain in the book of life during the coming age of the kingdom.<h2 class=head3>2. Not to Be Hurt of the Second Death</h2><p>Since the overcomers will inherit eternal life in the millennium, they will not be hurt of the second death. In Revelation 2:11 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death.&#8221; Due to the fall and the entering in of sin, every man must die once (Heb. 9:27). This first death, however, is not the final settlement. All the dead will be resurrected and pass through the judgment of the great white throne at the close of the millennium, that is, at the conclusion of the old heaven and the old earth, except those who through faith in the Lord Jesus have been recorded in the book of life. As a result of this judgment, they will all be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death as the final settlement (Rev. 20:11-15). Hence, the second death is God&#8217;s dealing with man after man&#8217;s death and resurrection. Because the overcomers have overcome death through their faithfulness unto death under persecution and have left nothing requiring further dealing by God after their resurrection, they will be rewarded with the crown of life and will not be touched, or hurt, any more by the death after resurrection, which is the second death.<h2 class=head3>3. To Eat of the Tree of Life in the Paradise of God-the New Jerusalem</h2><p>For the overcomers to inherit eternal life in the millennium also means that they will eat of the tree of life in the paradise of God-the New Jerusalem. Revelation 2:7b says, &#8220;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.&#8221; Here the paradise of God is the New Jerusalem, of which the church is a foretaste today. Strictly speaking, to eat of the tree of life in the paradise of God refers to the particular enjoyment of Christ as our life supply in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom, because this is a promise of reward made by the Lord to His overcomers. The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth will be the common portion of all God&#8217;s redeemed people, whereas the particular enjoyment of Him as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom will be a reward only to the overcoming believers. If we overcome all the distractions in the church&#8217;s degradation to enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the church today, we shall be rewarded with the eating of the tree of life in the paradise of God in the coming age. This will also be a fuller enjoyment of the eternal life.<h2 class=head2>N. To Shine Forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of Their Father</h2><p>The overcomers will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Matthew 13:43a says, &#8220;Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.&#8221; Daniel 12:3 speaks of the same thing. &#8220;They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.&#8221; Today the believers shine as lamps, but in the coming age the overcomers will shine as the sun.<p>Those who will shine as the sun are the sons of the kingdom (Matt. 13:38) as the righteous. According to Matthew 5:20, these sons of the kingdom will have the surpassing righteousness. They will be righteous to such an extent that their entire being will shine. This righteousness is the indwelling Christ lived out of us so that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future.<p>The overcomers as the righteous, the sons of the kingdom, will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father, the heavenly part of the millennium. We are sons of God the Father, and God is light (1 John 1:5; 1 Tim. 6:16). The divine light, which is God Himself, is, of course, much greater than the light of the sun. When in the millennium the overcoming believers enjoy the Father as light, they will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<h2 class=head2>O. To Participate in the Feast of the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>In the coming age the overcomers will participate in the feast of the kingdom of the heavens. Matthew 8:11 indicates that the overcoming believers will feast with Old Testament overcomers. In this verse the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.&#8221; This refers to the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. It will be in the manifestation of the kingdom that the overcoming believers in Christ will feast with the Old Testament overcomers including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p>As the overcomers participate in the feast of the kingdom of the heavens, they will drink the cup of the new covenant anew with their Lord. In Matthew 26:29 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I will by no means drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father.&#8221; This word was spoken when the Lord was establishing the table (Matt. 26:26-30). By speaking this word, He made it clear that from the time He established the table He would be physically away from the believers and not drink the fruit of the vine with them until He drinks it anew with them in the Father&#8217;s kingdom. After His coming back, the Lord will drink the cup of the new covenant anew with the overcoming believers. Therefore, the Lord&#8217;s promise in Matthew 26:29 will be fulfilled with the overcomers in the kingdom of the Father during the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.<h2 class=head2>P. To Enjoy the Reward</h2><p>The overcomers will enjoy the reward. In Matthew 5:11 and 12 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and say every evil thing against you, lying, for My sake. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in the heavens; for thus they persecuted the prophets before you.&#8221; This reward is great and is in the heavens, a heavenly reward, not an earthly one.<p>In Matthew 16:27 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;The Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each man according to his doings.&#8221; The context indicates that the Lord&#8217;s rewarding of His followers at His coming back in this verse will be according to whether they lose or save their soul, as mentioned in verses 25 and 26. This means that the reward will be given according to how we have borne the cross. It will depend on whether or not we keep ourselves under the killing of the cross, on whether we save our soul life in this age or lose it. If we bear the cross to follow the Lord by losing the enjoyment of our soul in this age, He will reward us with the enjoyment of the soul in the kingdom.<p>In 16:27 the Lord says that He will reward &#8220;each man according to his doings,&#8221; that is, according to whether or not we lose our soul life&#8217;s enjoyment in this age. This will have nothing to do with our eternal salvation; however, it will have very much to do with the Lord&#8217;s dispensational reward to us. The Lord&#8217;s reward will be the entering into the kingdom, which will be at the manifestation of the kingdom. The manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium will be the reward to the followers who remain under the killing of the cross. All the believers who follow Christ in this way will be rewarded with the manifestation of the kingdom.<p>Luke 14:14 says, &#8220;You will be blessed, because they do not have anything with which to repay you; for it will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous.&#8221; This resurrection is the resurrection of life (John 5:29; Rev. 20:4-6), when God will reward the saints (Rev. 11:18) at the Lord&#8217;s return (1 Cor. 4:5).<p>In order to receive the reward in the coming age, we need to enjoy Christ faithfully in this age. Many saved ones are not faithful to enjoy Christ today. For this reason, God has set up a reward as an incentive so that we may enjoy Christ faithfully in this present age. If we do not enjoy Christ faithfully today, we shall lose the enjoyment of Christ in the coming age. Here we see that in His wisdom God has made the enjoyment of Christ in the coming age a reward for the faithful ones, the ones who enjoy Christ faithfully in this age. There are no terms, no conditions, for enjoying Christ in this age. As long as we believe in Him, accepting God&#8217;s invitation, we may enjoy Christ today. Nevertheless, we need to enjoy Him faithfully in order to receive the reward in the coming age of the kingdom. Otherwise, we shall lose the enjoyment of Christ in the coming age.<p>Revelation 11:18b tells us, &#8220;The time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to give the reward to Your slaves the prophets, and to the saints.&#8221; The reward will be given by the Lord to His faithful ones at His coming back (Rev. 22:12; Matt. 16:27). The purpose of the judgment of the prophets and the saints will be to determine who among the saved persons will be worthy of a reward and who will need further discipline. The giving of the reward to the prophets and to the saints will occur after the resurrection and rapture of the saints.<p>In Revelation 22:12 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to render to each one according to his work.&#8221; &#8220;I come quickly&#8221; is the Lord&#8217;s repeated warning (vv. 7, 20) that we may consider His reward at His coming back. The Greek word translated &#8220;reward&#8221; in 22:12 means wages. At the Lord&#8217;s coming, this reward will be rendered to each one of the believers, after their rapture, at the judgment seat of Christ.<p>Second Corinthians 5:10 says, &#8220;We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may be recompensed for the things done through the body, according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad.&#8221; The judgment seat of Christ is where Christ will judge His believers at His coming back, not concerning their eternal salvation but concerning their dispensational reward (1 Cor. 4:4-5; 3:13-15). Alford points out that &#8220;recompense&#8221; is a technical word for receiving wages. While we are still at home in the body, we should do things through it to please the Lord, that we may be rewarded for them by the Lord at His coming.<p>Hebrews 10:35 says, &#8220;Do not cast away therefore your boldness, which has great reward.&#8221; The reward spoken of here is the kingdom reward because it will be given to us for our enjoyment in the coming kingdom, not in this age. Today in the church life the kingdom is an exercise. If we are faithful in the kingdom exercise today, we shall be rewarded with the kingdom as an enjoyment in the coming age. Then it will be the kingdom reward.<p>The kingdom reward is in addition to eternal salvation (Heb. 5:9). Based on Christ&#8217;s eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12), eternal salvation has been given to us freely and eternally according to God&#8217;s eternal selection of us. This is eternally secure. However, after receiving this salvation, how we would behave ourselves is a problem. Hence, according to God&#8217;s wisdom, in addition to this eternal salvation, a reward is promised as an incentive to us that we may be faithful in our living by the Lord and in our working for Him.<p>Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work (Eph. 2:8-9), whereas the kingdom reward is for our work after we are saved. We may not receive the kingdom reward even though we are saved, because we are void of the work which the Lord would approve (1 Cor. 3:15). In Hebrews 10:35 the Hebrew believers in particular are charged not to miss the kingdom reward-the coming Sabbath rest (Heb. 4:9), the enjoyment of Christ and the reign with Christ in the coming age.<p>Hebrews 11:26, speaking of Moses, says, &#8220;Esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked away to the reward.&#8221; Because he was willing to suffer the reproach of the Christ, Moses will receive the reward of the kingdom. He was not allowed to enter into the rest of the good land because of his failure at Meribah (Num. 20:12-13; Deut. 4:26-27; 32:50-52), but he will be with Christ in the kingdom (Matt. 16:28-17:3). By referring to this, the writer surely intended to encourage his readers who were suffering persecution for Christ&#8217;s sake to follow Moses by esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the things they lost, and looking away to the reward.<p>In 1 Corinthians 3:8b, Paul tells us, &#8220;Each one shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.&#8221; Then in verse 14, concerning building upon Christ as the unique foundation, Paul goes on to say, &#8220;If anyone&#8217;s work which he has built upon it shall remain, he shall receive a reward.&#8221; According to the context, the work that remains must be that of gold, silver, and precious stones, the product of faithful ministers of Christ. Such a work will be rewarded by the coming and judging Lord. Reward is based on a believer&#8217;s work after being saved. It differs from salvation, which is based on faith in the Lord Jesus and His redemptive work. In 1 Corinthians 9:17 Paul, speaking of preaching the gospel, says, &#8220;If I do this voluntarily, I have a reward.&#8221; The book of 1 Corinthians was written not to help lost sinners to be saved but to help saved believers to grow (3:6-7), to build with precious materials (3:10,12-14), to care for the Lord&#8217;s members (8:9-13), and to run the race (9:24). For this reason, reward is mentioned repeatedly as an incentive to the believers&#8217; progress (3:14; 9:18, 24-25).<p>In 1 Corinthians 9:24 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Do you not know that those who run in a race-course all run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may lay hold.&#8221; This reveals that the Christian life is a race we must run successfully in order to receive the prize. This prize is a reward as an incentive.<h2 class=head2>Q. To Be the New Jerusalem- the Paradise-in the Millennium</h2><p>Finally, the overcomers in the church will be the New Jerusalem-the paradise-in the millennium. This is indicated by the Lord&#8217;s word in Revelation 3:12 and 2:7. Revelation 3:12 says, &#8220;He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.&#8221; Here we see that the overcomer will be made a pillar built into the temple of God. Because he is built into God&#8217;s building, &#8220;He shall by no means go out anymore.&#8221; This promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom as a prize to the overcomer.<p>The name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the Lord&#8217;s new name written upon the overcomer indicate that the overcomer is possessed by God, by the New Jerusalem, and by the Lord; that God Himself, His city, the New Jerusalem, and the Lord Himself all belong to him; and that he is one with God, with the New Jerusalem and with the Lord. The name of God means God Himself, the name of the New Jerusalem means the city itself and the name of the Lord means the Lord Himself. To write the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the name of the Lord upon the overcomer indicates that what God is, the nature of the New Jerusalem, and the person of the Lord have all been wrought into the overcomer. The mentioning of the New Jerusalem as a prize to the overcomer indicates that this promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom. The New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom will be a prize only to the overcoming saints, whereas the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all the redeemed for eternity.<p>Revelation 2:7 speaks of the paradise of God. The paradise in Luke 23:43 is the pleasant and restful place where Abraham and all the dead saints are (Luke 16:23-26). But the paradise of God in Revelation 2:7 is the New Jerusalem (3:12; 21:2, 10; 22:1-2, 14, 19), of which the church is a foretaste today. The overcomers in the church will actually be the New Jerusalem-the paradise of God-in the millennium, for in the coming age the New Jerusalem will be a composition of all the overcomers to be the paradise of God.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>In the foregoing messages we saw the failures in the churches, the degradation of the church, and the overcomers in the church. In this message we shall begin to consider the vital matter of the recovery of the church.<h2 class=head1>XIV. THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>The word &#8220;recover&#8221; means to obtain again something that has been lost, or to return something to a normal condition. &#8220;Recovery&#8221; means the restoration or return to a normal condition after a damage or a loss has been incurred. When we speak of the recovery of the church, we mean that something was there originally, that it became lost or damaged, and that now there is the need to bring that thing back to its original state. Because the church has become degraded through the many centuries of its history, it needs to be restored according to God&#8217;s original intention. Concerning the church, our vision should be governed not by the present situation nor by traditional practice but by God&#8217;s original intention and standard as revealed in the Scriptures.<p>We need to understand the recovery of the church in relation to God&#8217;s intention and accomplishment and Satan&#8217;s work of destruction. The New Testament reveals that regarding the church God has a definite intention, purpose, and goal. The New Testament also gives us a clear picture of God&#8217;s accomplishment according to His intention. First, God purposed and then He came in to accomplish His purpose. Furthermore, the New Testament also gives us a clear record of how God&#8217;s enemy came in to destroy what God had accomplished. The satanic way to destroy God&#8217;s accomplishment has two aspects: the inward and the outward. The inward aspect is to damage and corrupt God&#8217;s people. Then Satan seeks to destroy God&#8217;s accomplishment outwardly. Nevertheless, God is a God with an eternal purpose. He is a purposeful God, and once He has made up His mind to do something, nothing can change His mind or stop Him. Therefore, after Satan&#8217;s destruction, God comes in to redo the things that He had done before. This redoing is His recovery. This is to bring back whatever has been lost and destroyed by God&#8217;s enemy, Satan.<h2 class=head2>A. Typified by the Return of the Children of Israel from Their Captivity</h2><p>The recovery of the church is typified by the return of the children of Israel from their captivity (Ezra 1:3-11). In order to understand the recovery of the church, we need to consider the history of the people of Israel in the Old Testament. The Old Testament is a book of types, and the greatest, all-inclusive type is the history of the people of Israel. Many Bible teachers apply the things which happened in the beginning of the history of the people of Israel to Christian experience today. For example, they apply the Passover to the experience of redemption and the crossing of the Red Sea to the experience of baptism. Furthermore, we may apply the enjoyment of the daily manna and of the water from the cleft rock to our experience of taking Christ as our life supply and as our living water. We may even know how to apply the temple built by Solomon to our experience. However, not many Christians know how to apply the last part of the history of the people of Israel-the captivity in Babylon and the return from captivity. As we shall see, the return of the children of Israel from their captivity typifies the recovery of the church.<p>In the Old Testament God first gained a people through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Eventually, that people became the nation of Israel, which was called a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). That people, that nation, was a type of the church. In Acts 7:38 Stephen even refers to the people of Israel as &#8220;the assembly in the wilderness,&#8221; using the word ekklesia, the word for &#8220;church&#8221; in the New Testament. This is a further indication that the children of Israel are a type of the church.<p>The entire history of the nation of Israel is a full type, an all-inclusive type, of the church. The nation of Israel began with the exodus. The children of Israel were in slavery in Egypt, but through the lamb of the Passover they were redeemed out from Pharaoh&#8217;s usurpation. They made their exodus from Egypt, crossed the Red Sea, entered the wilderness, and came to Mount Sinai, and there they built the tabernacle as God&#8217;s dwelling place on earth. Eventually, the people of Israel crossed the Jordan and entered into Canaan, the good land. After conquering the people and gaining the land, they built the temple. The time immediately after the building of the temple was a golden time. However, that golden time did not last very long. Mainly due to the failure of Solomon, the temple was destroyed, and the children of Israel were taken to Babylon as captives. The Babylonian army not only destroyed Jerusalem with its temple but also brought the utensils of the temple to Babylon and put them into idol temples. What a shame! The people of Israel remained in Babylon for seventy years.<p>Spiritually speaking, the church, due to its degradation, has been in captivity. God&#8217;s people have been divided, scattered, and carried away from the proper ground of unity to a wrong ground. In the Old Testament type, the children of Israel were centered around Jerusalem, but later they were scattered and carried away to many places, in particular, to Babylon. This portrays the situation among many of today&#8217;s Christians. In a very real sense, the believers today are more scattered than the children of Israel were. Therefore, we need to be recovered. We need not only revival but also recovery.<h2 class=head3>1. From Babylon- the Capturing and Divisive Ground</h2><p>As typified by the latter part of the history of the children of Israel, the recovery is from Babylon-the capturing and divisive ground (Ezra 1:11). For the children of Israel to be recovered meant for them to be brought back to Jerusalem from Babylon. Negatively, to be recovered means to be brought out of Babylon; positively, it means to be brought up to Jerusalem. Although the Scriptures reveal that some of the people of Israel were taken captive to Syria and others to Egypt, the majority of them were taken captive to Babylon. Babylon was the main place of their captivity. Hence, in type the meaning of Jerusalem is the ground of unity, and the meaning of Babylon is division, scattering, and captivity. To be recovered out of Babylon is to be recovered out of division, and to be recovered to Jerusalem means to be recovered back to the original ground of unity.<p>In the Old Testament, the temple was destroyed, and all its vessels were carried away to Babylon and placed in the temple of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s idols. This signifies that at a certain time the entire church was destroyed by the &#8220;Babylonians,&#8221; who carried away the contents of the temple to Babylon and placed them in the temple of their idols. At a certain time in church history, Babylonianism came into the church, destroyed it, and carried away its contents. If you study church history, you will see that this was truly the situation. Therefore, in Revelation 17 the apostate church is called Babylon the Great, the great prostitute.<p>In its degradation the church was captured and held in the captivity of Babylon the Great. In Revelation 18 Babylon refers to the city of Rome. In a figure of speech, John, the writer of Revelation, called Rome &#8220;Babylon the Great.&#8221; Eventually, the organized church under the pope was called the Roman Church. This Roman Church in Revelation 17 is given by the Lord the title &#8220;Babylon the Great, The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth&#8221; (Rev. 17:5). This expression corresponds to the use of the word Babylon in Old Testament times. In those times God&#8217;s people were carried away to Babylon and kept in captivity there. In the New Testament, with the fulfillment of the type, the principle is the same: the church, God&#8217;s chosen people, eventually were held in the captivity of Babylon the Great. This means that both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament God&#8217;s people were held captive in Babylon.<p>If we see this, we shall have a clear view, an overall view, concerning the degradation of the church and the recovery of the church. The captivity of the children of Israel was due to their degradation. Because of their degradation, they were carried away to captivity in Babylon. The church also became degraded and eventually was brought into captivity by Babylon the great, Christendom, which is a prostitute in the eyes of the holy God. The recovery of the church, therefore, involves a return from the capturing and divisive ground signified by Babylon.<h2 class=head3>2. Back to Jerusalem, the God-ordained Unique Ground, with all the Vessels of the Temple of God Which Had Been Captured to Babylon</h2><p>The recovery of the children of Israel was not only from Babylon but back to Jerusalem, the God-ordained unique ground. Jerusalem was the place the Lord had chosen (Deut. 12:5). Jerusalem, therefore, was the center for God&#8217;s people to worship Him, and this unique center preserved the unity of the people of God. Without such a center, after the children of Israel had entered the good land, they would have been divided. Foreseeing this problem, God repeated the commandment again and again concerning the place of His choosing (Deut. 12:5, 11,13-14). The people of Israel had no right to choose their own place to worship. That right was in God&#8217;s hands; He alone could make that choice, and the people were to take His choice, the divine choice. God&#8217;s choice became the center of the gathering of His people, and this is the unique ground of unity. For this reason, it was necessary for God&#8217;s people in the Old Testament to be brought back to Jerusalem, the unique ground ordained by God.<p>For God&#8217;s people in the Old Testament, Jerusalem was the unique place of worship, the uniting center. Babylon caused division, but Jerusalem maintained the oneness. Today&#8217;s Babylon is division, and today&#8217;s Jerusalem is oneness. When we come back to oneness we come back to Jerusalem.<p>Those who went back to Jerusalem from Babylon brought with them all the vessels of the temple of God which had been captured to Babylon (Ezra 1:5-11). These vessels, which were of silver and gold, signify the experiences of Christ and the riches of Christ. All the vessels in the temple are the experiences of the various aspects of Christ. The people of God were scattered, and all the spiritual experiences were carried away. That was a shame to them and to God. Even today, some dear Christians have real experiences of Christ, but they are in Babylon. This means that they have the experiences of Christ in the place of captivity, and in the place of idols. The experiences are right, but the place is wrong, for the vessels are right, but they are the vessels of the temple of God in the temple of idols. Therefore, all the vessels of silver and gold must be brought back to Jerusalem.<p>In typology, silver refers to Christ&#8217;s redemption, and gold refers to the divine nature, the nature of God. The children of Israel bringing vessels of silver and gold with them from Babylon to Jerusalem indicates that our experiences must be the experiences of Christ and His redemption and of God and His nature.<p>Today&#8217;s Babylon has not only captured God&#8217;s people but also robbed all the riches from God&#8217;s temple. The vessels, signifying the riches of Christ, have been carried away. This is the reason that in Roman Catholicism and in the Protestant denominations very little is said, if anything, concerning the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8). The believers are not encouraged to eat Christ, to drink Christ, to feast with Christ, to enjoy Christ in full. The reason there is little or no enjoyment of the riches of Christ is that all the vessels in the temple have been carried away by Babylon the Great. Now the Lord wants to recover the experience of the riches of Christ. He wants not only to call His faithful people out of Babylon and back to the proper church life, but also to recover and bring back all the different aspects of Christ which have been lost.<h2 class=head3>3. To Rebuild the Temple of God, the House of God</h2><p>The recovery of the church is also typified by the rebuilding of the temple of God, the house of God, in Jerusalem after the return of God&#8217;s people from Babylon. Ezra 1:3 says, &#8220;Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Lord God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.&#8221; Verse 5 goes on to say, &#8220;Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.&#8221; These verses indicate that the recovery is not only a matter of going back to Jerusalem with the vessels of the temple of God but also of rebuilding the temple of God, which had been destroyed.<h2 class=head3>4. To Rebuild the City of Jerusalem</h2><p>Finally, the recovery of the church is typified in the Old Testament by the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem (Neh. 2:11, 17). After the recovery of the building of the temple, there was still the need to build up the city. Without the city, there would have been no protection for the temple. The temple, the place of the Lord&#8217;s presence, needed protection. The wall of the city was the defense to the temple.<p>This also is an aspect of the type that we must apply in the New Testament. Ephesians 2:19 and 1 Timothy 3:15 speak of the church as the house of God. But in the last two chapters of Revelation, there is a city, and in this city there is no temple (Rev. 21:22), because the city has become the enlargement of the temple.<p>In order to understand the relationship between the house and the city in the New Testament, we need to realize that the church is the enlargement of Christ and the increase of Christ. All the believers are parts of Christ and members of Christ. All these parts put together are the increase of Christ. The church, therefore, is the fullness of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23) because Christ has been increased and enlarged into so many members. The first step of the enlargement of Christ is the church as the house. The second step of this enlargement is also the church, not as the house but as the city. The church as the house must be enlarged to be the church as the city. Eventually, the whole church becomes the city. Because the temple has become the city, Revelation 21:22 tells us that there is no temple in the city of New Jerusalem. The city is the tabernacle, the dwelling place (Rev. 21:2-3). Hence, the city is the enlargement of the temple, the development of the house, to the uttermost.<p>The building of the house and the city is the center of God&#8217;s eternal purpose. This building is actually the mingling of God with man. The church, therefore, is the mingling of divinity with humanity. When this mingling is enlarged and consummated to the fullest extent, that is the city. The city, then, eventually becomes the mutual building, the mutual habitation, of God and man, for God dwells in us and we dwell in God. This is the universal, eternal mingling of God with man. On a small scale, this is the house, and on a large scale, it is the city.<p>Christ&#8217;s first coming had very much to do with the return of God&#8217;s people from Babylon to Jerusalem. Christ came a little over four hundred years after this return from captivity. Christ was born of Mary, a descendant of those who had returned to Jerusalem. If none of God&#8217;s people had returned from Babylon to Jerusalem, there would have been no one to carry out Christ&#8217;s first coming. However, according to the New Testament, there was a number of holy people, including Mary, Zechariah and Elizabeth (the parents of John the Baptist), Simeon, and Anna, all of whom were descendants of those who returned from captivity. All these were very much used for the first coming of Christ.<p>The principle is the same with Christ&#8217;s second coming. If there is no recovery of the church life, that is, no return of God&#8217;s people from Babylon the Great to the church life, there will be no way for Christ to carry out His second coming. This is the reason that the Lord, at the end time, is working to have a recovery. I believe that this recovery will be a preparation and a base for Christ&#8217;s coming again. There will be many Marys, Zechariahs, Elizabeths, Simeons, and Annas to prepare a base for Him to accomplish His second coming. Therefore, for Christ&#8217;s second coming there is the need of the recovery of the church.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In the foregoing message we saw that the recovery of the church is typified by the return of the children of Israel from their captivity. In this message we shall see that the recovery of the church is indicated in the New Testament.<h2 class=head2>B. Indicated in the Later Epistles of the New Testament</h2><p>The recovery of the church is fully revealed in the New Testament even though the word &#8220;recovery&#8221; is not used. This recovery is revealed mainly in the later Epistles of the New Testament. We do not find the recovery of the church in such Epistles as Romans or 1 Corinthians, but we do find it in Titus, 2 Timothy, 2 John, and Revelation. In these later writings of the New Testament the recovery is fully unveiled.<h2 class=head3>1. To Be Separated from the Factious- the Sects and Denominations</h2><p>For the recovery of the church, we need to be separated from the factious-the sects and denominations. This is indicated by Paul&#8217;s word in Titus 3:10. &#8220;A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse.&#8221; A factious man is a sectarian man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinions. A factious, divisive person, after a first and second admonition, should be refused, rejected. This is to stop intercourse with a contagiously divisive person for the church&#8217;s benefit.<p>Nearly all believers today are factious. They honor, respect, and uplift their denominations. Furthermore, they nourish and build their denominations. Hence, they are builders of sects and denominations. Millions of Christians today are members of these sects. Because they are members of sects, we cannot join them, even though they may be genuine brothers in Christ. We surely love our brothers in Christ, but they are in the denominations and the sects, where we cannot be. It is not that we separate ourselves from other believers; it is that the sects and denominations separate us from the church life. If we are to share in the recovery of the church, we need to be separated from all the sects and denominations. Like Ezra, Nehemiah, and other faithful ones in the Old Testament, we need to leave Babylon and come back to Jerusalem.<h2 class=head3>2. To Cleanse Ourselves from the Vessels unto Dishonor in the Great House- the Apostate Christendom</h2><p>The recovery of the church also requires that we cleanse ourselves from the vessels unto dishonor in the great house-the apostate Christendom. &#8220;In a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen, and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor; if therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work&#8221; (2 Tim. 2:20-21). Here Paul uses the expression &#8220;a great house.&#8221; The house of God defined in 1 Timothy 3:15 and 16 is the genuine church in its divine nature and essential character as the foundation of the truth, whereas the great house here refers to the deteriorated church in its mixed character, as illustrated by the abnormally big tree in Matthew 13:31-32. In this great house there are not only precious vessels but also base ones. For this reason, we cannot believe that the great house in 2 Timothy 2:20 refers to the church as the house of the living God in 1 Timothy 3:15. The great house is certainly not the house of the living God, which is the great mystery of godliness and also God manifest in the flesh. Such a house cannot contain vessels unto dishonor. Hence, the great house must refer to Christendom. Furthermore, this great house is equal to the big tree in Matthew 13. The genuine church today is the house of the living God, whereas the apostate Christendom is the great house. Just as many unclean birds lodge in the big tree, so in the great house there are vessels unto dishonor, wooden and earthen vessels. In the genuine church, however, there are only gold and silver vessels.<p>Honorable vessels are of both the divine nature (gold) and the redeemed and regenerated human nature (silver). These are the genuine believers. Dishonorable vessels are of the fallen human nature (wooden and earthen) and signify the false believers. The word &#8220;these&#8221; in verse 21 indicates that the genuine believers need to cleanse themselves from the dishonorable vessels. This means that we must stay away from them. If we cleanse ourselves from negative things and negative persons, we shall be vessels unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master and prepared unto every good work.<h2 class=head3>3. Not to Contact Those Who Do Not Abide in the Teaching of Christ- the Teaching concerning Christ&#8217;s Deity and Incarnation by Divine Conception</h2><p>&#8220;Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice! For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works&#8221; (2 John 9-11). These verses reveal that we should not contact those who do not abide in the teaching of Christ-the teaching concerning Christ&#8217;s deity and incarnation by divine conception. Literally, the Greek word translated &#8220;goes beyond&#8221; in verse 9 means to lead forward (in a negative sense), that is, to go further than what is right, to advance beyond the limit of orthodox teaching concerning Christ. Those who go beyond in this way go beyond the teaching of the divine conception of Christ and thus deny the deity of Christ. Consequently they do not have God in salvation and in life.<p>In verse 9 John speaks of not abiding in the teaching of Christ. This is not the teaching by Christ but the teaching concerning Christ, that is, the truth concerning the deity of Christ, especially regarding His incarnation by divine conception.<p>Today&#8217;s modernists go beyond and do not abide in the teaching of Christ. They also claim to be advanced in their thinking. According to them, it is out-of-date to say that Christ is God, that He was born of a virgin through divine conception, that He died on the cross for our sins, and that He was resurrected both physically and spiritually. Denying this truth concerning Christ, the modernists claim to be advanced in their philosophical thought.<p>According to verse 9, the one who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God. But he who abides in the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son. To &#8220;have God&#8221; is to have both the Father and the Son.<p>According to verse 10, we should not receive the one who does not bring the teaching concerning Christ. The pronoun &#8220;him&#8221; in this verse refers to a heretic, an antichrist, a false prophet, who denies the divine conception and deity of Christ. Furthermore, we should not tell such a one to rejoice, to be happy. We should not have any contact with those who do not abide in the teaching of Christ; that is, we should have a severe and clear separation from those who do not have the teaching concerning Christ&#8217;s deity and incarnation by divine conception.<p>At this point I would like to say a word concerning the conception and birth of the Lord Jesus, the God-man. Matthew 1:20 says, &#8220;While he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take Mary your wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; In this verse the King James Version uses &#8220;conceived&#8221; instead of &#8220;begotten.&#8221; The word &#8220;conceived&#8221; is a proper, normal, ordinary description of conception within a woman. The word &#8220;begotten&#8221; is a particular expression used to describe the conception that had taken place in Mary&#8217;s womb. Within Mary something was not merely conceived but was begotten.<p>The Greek word for begotten in Matthew 1:20 is gennao. In Matthew 1:2-16 the Greek word is used thirty-eight times and is translated as &#8220;begot.&#8221; Verse 16 says, &#8220;And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;born&#8221; here is also a form of the word gennao. In English the past participle of beget is begotten, and the past participle of bear is born. Furthermore, in English we can differentiate the words beget and bear, using beget to refer to the male and bear to the female. The male generates the conception, and the female completes the conception by her delivery of the child. Then we have the birth.<p>Although we can differentiate in English the words beget and bear, in Greek gennao is used both for the male&#8217;s begetting and the female&#8217;s bearing. In the first sixteen verses of Matthew 1, gennao, translated &#8220;begot,&#8221; is used thirty-eight times with respect to males. In verse 16 this word is used in relation to the female and is translated &#8220;born.&#8221; Jesus was not begotten of Mary-He was born of her. The point we would emphasize here is that in Matthew 1 the same Greek word is used both for a male&#8217;s generating and for a female&#8217;s giving birth. Verse 20 speaks of &#8220;that which is begotten in her.&#8221; It would also be correct to translate this verse, &#8220;That which is born in her.&#8221;<p>The word &#8220;begetting&#8221; may also be used to include the whole process of conception and birth. When the Bible says, &#8220;Abraham begot Isaac,&#8221; the word &#8220;begot&#8221; includes both the father&#8217;s generating and also the mother&#8217;s delivery. The word begot used thirty-eight times in Matthew 1:2-16 comprises both the generating of the conception and the completing of the birth.<p>Thus far, we have two important facts. First, the word &#8220;begotten&#8221; in 1:20 is a particular expression describing Mary&#8217;s conception. Because this expression is particular, extraordinary, we should not understand it in an ordinary way. This was not a usual, common, normal conception, and we cannot understand it according to the knowledge in our natural mind. On the contrary, we should understand it according to the facts revealed in the Bible. The second fact is that the words begot and begotten in Matthew 1 comprise the delivery as well as the conception.<p>With these facts as the basis, we may say that in the divine conception God was born into Mary. This is not a matter of biology but a matter of the divine incarnation. In this incarnation God was born, begotten, into Mary. The Lord Jesus was God born into a human virgin. Because He was born into a virgin, He took on humanity and was delivered out of that virgin to become the God-man. This is Jesus, Jehovah the Savior and Emmanuel, God with us (Matt. 1:21, 23).<p>&#8220;Jesus&#8221; is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word Joshua (Num. 13:16), which means Jehovah the Savior, or, the salvation of Jehovah. Hence, Jesus is not only a man but Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation. Whereas Jesus was the name given by God, &#8220;Emmanuel,&#8221; meaning &#8220;God with us,&#8221; was the name called by man. Jesus the Savior is God with us. He is God incarnated to dwell among us (John 1:14). He is not only God but God with us.<h2 class=head3>4. To Come Out of the Religious Babylon the Great</h2><p>Revelation 17 presents a vision of Babylon the Great. According to verse 5, Babylon the Great is called &#8220;The Mother of the Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth.&#8221; Verse 4 exposes the fact that although this woman has a pleasant appearance, evil is concealed within her. &#8220;The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication.&#8221; Outwardly Babylon the Great is clothed in purple and scarlet and is gilded with gold, precious stone, and pearls. Furthermore, she has a golden cup in her hand. But this cup is full of abominations and unclean things of her fornication. This is a picture of Christendom today. Christendom may have the golden cup, but the contents of the cup are idolatry, fornication, and every kind of evil.<p>We surely cannot remain in Babylon the Great. Rather, we need to obey the Lord&#8217;s word in Revelation 18:4. Here He tells us, &#8220;Come out of her, My people, that you may not participate in her sins, and that you may not receive other plagues.&#8221; Since Babylon the Great is twofold, to come out of her means to come out of both religious Babylon and material Babylon. This coming out is for the coming back to the proper church life, and this coming back is the recovery. Although we love all the brothers in Christ in the Catholic Church and in the denominations, we must leave the Babylonian system and come back to Jerusalem, that is, come back to the proper church life. This is the recovery of the church.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>We have seen that the recovery of the church is typified by the return of the children of Israel from their captivity and that it is indicated in some of the later New Testament writings. Now we shall go on to see what it means for the church to be recovered. In this message we shall consider the matter of being recovered from the divisive and apostate ground with its deviation from the truths concerning the person of the Triune God and the person and work of Christ. In the following message we shall see the significance of being recovered back to the unique and pure ground of the oneness of the Body of Christ with its truths concerning the New Testament faith and God&#8217;s economy, the person and work of Christ, the person and the dispensing of the Triune God, the church as the Body of Christ, and the universal and local aspects of the church. Then we shall go on to cover the building of the Body of Christ, the temple of God, the house of God, and the establishing of the kingdom life.<h2 class=head2>C. To Be Recovered:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. From the Divisive and Apostate Ground with Its Deviation from the Truths concerning:</h2><h2 class=head4>a. The Person of the Triune God</h2><p>We need to be recovered from the divisive and apostate ground with its deviation from the truth concerning the person of the Triune God. During the centuries, three main schools of teaching concerning the Trinity have emerged: modalism, tritheism, and the pure revelation according to the Bible. Modalism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not all eternal and do not all exist at the same time, but are merely three temporary manifestations of the one God. Tritheism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three Gods. We should have nothing to do with modalism, for that extreme view of the Trinity is a heresy. It is also a great heresy to teach that there are three Gods.<p>According to the natural law in God&#8217;s creation, there is the law of balance. Nothing can exist without having two sides. The principle is the same with the truths in the Bible: all the truths in the Scriptures have two sides. Therefore, in order to hold a truth properly, we must hold both sides of it.<p>The pure revelation of the Triune God in the Bible occupies a central position between the extremes of modalism and tritheism. Because the truths in the Scriptures have two sides, there are two aspects to the Trinity: the aspect of the one-in-three and the aspect of the three-in-one. Modalism is an extreme on the side of the three-in-one. There is, of course, ground in the Scriptures for the side of the three-in-one, but modalism, going to an extreme, far beyond the confines of the Bible, neglects and even annuls the side of the one-in-three. Modalism has gone beyond the confines of the Scriptures concerning the aspect of the three. Hence, it is a heresy on the extreme of the one. Tritheism is the opposite extreme. Tritheism stresses the side of the three and neglects the side of the one. It also has scriptural ground because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit certainly are three. But tritheism, like modalism, also goes beyond the confines of the Bible and becomes a heresy. Therefore, both modalism and tritheism, being extremes, are heresies. The following diagrams will help us to visualize this:<center><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/images/diagrams/modalism-chart.gif" width="480" height="150" border="0" alt="diagram"></center><p>The Bible is not at either of these extremes; it stands in the center, testifying the twofoldness of the truth of the Trinity. In this matter, the Scriptures are balanced. The Bible, true to the principle of balance in God&#8217;s creation, is balanced and in the center; it does not go to an extreme.<p>We need to be very clear concerning the error in modalism. Modalism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not all eternal and do not all exist at the same time. Instead, modalism claims that the revelation of the Son ended with the ascension and that after the ascension the Son ceased to exist. Modalism has gone too far, not believing in the coinherence and coexistence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Unlike the modalists, we believe in the coinherence and coexistence of the three of the Godhead; that is, we believe that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit all exist at the same time and under the same conditions. We also believe that all three are eternal. Isaiah 9:6 says that the Father is eternal, Hebrews 1:12 and 7:3 indicate that the Son is eternal, and Hebrews 9:14 speaks of the eternal Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not temporary but eternal.<p>The truth concerning the person of the Triune God is twofold. This means that the truth has two sides or two aspects: the aspect of the one and the aspect of the three. The twofoldness of the truth concerning the Trinity is embodied in the word &#8220;triune.&#8221; This adjective is actually a Latin word composed of two parts: tri-, meaning three, and -une, meaning one. The word triune, therefore, means three-one. On the one hand, our God is uniquely one; on the other hand, He is three. In the aspect of God&#8217;s being one, there is no separation between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. However, in the aspect of God&#8217;s being three, there is a distinction between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me&#8221; (John 14:10). Because the Father and the Son are mutually in each other, They cannot be separated. Nevertheless, there is still a distinction between the Father and the Son.<p>Concerning the Trinity we should not drift to either of two extremes, to the tritheistic extreme of emphasizing the three or to the modalistic extreme of emphasizing the one. In order to be balanced, we need to emphasize both aspects of the Trinity-the aspect of the three and the aspect of the one. Although the Father and the Son are one, there is still a definite distinction between Them. In the sense of distinction, the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit. Although there is a distinction between the three of the Godhead, the three nonetheless are still one.<p>In The Principles of Theology W. H. Griffith Thomas says the following:<p class=indent1>The term &#8220;Person&#8221; is also sometimes objected to. Like all human language, it is liable to be accused of inadequacy and even positive error. It certainly must not be pressed too far, or it will lead to Tritheism. While we use the term to denote distinctions in the Godhead, we do not imply distinctions which amount to separateness, but distinctions which are associated with essential mutual coinherence or inclusiveness...While, therefore, we are compelled to use terms like &#8220;substance&#8221; and &#8220;Person,&#8221; we are not to think of them as identical with what we understand as human substance or personality. The terms are not explanatory, but only approximately correct, as must necessarily be the case with any attempt to define the Nature of God.<p>I especially appreciate Griffith Thomas&#8217;s word that the term &#8220;Person&#8221; must not be pressed too far &#8220;or it will lead to Tritheism,&#8221; the belief in three Gods. In the same principle, when we say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one, we should not press this too far, or we will fall into another kind of error. Some have used sunlight as an illustration: the sun is the Father, the ray is the Son, and the shining is the Spirit. Another illustration is that of ice, water, and vapor, with these three respectively representing the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Such illustrations may be used for temporary help; however, they should not be pressed too far, or they will lead to error.<h2 class=head4>b. The Person and Work of Christ</h2><p>We also need to be recovered from the divisive and apostate ground with its deviation from the truth concerning the person and work of Christ. One such deviation from the truth concerning Christ&#8217;s person is mentioned in 1 John 2:22 and 23. Verse 22 says, &#8220;Who is the liar if not he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, who is denying the Father and the Son.&#8221; Even in the first century, certain heretics said that Jesus was not the Christ. Denying that Jesus is the Christ was the heresy of Cerinthus, who distinguished the maker (creator) of the world from God and represented that maker as a subordinate power. He taught adoptionist Christology, saying that Jesus became the Son of God by exaltation to a status that was not His by birth, thus denying the conception of Jesus by the Holy Spirit. In his heresy Cerinthus separated the earthly man Jesus, regarded as the son of Joseph and Mary, from the heavenly Christ. According to John&#8217;s word, Cerinthus was an antichrist because he denied that Jesus is the Christ.<p>In verse 22 John tells us that the antichrist denies the Father and the Son. To confess that Jesus is the Christ is to confess that He is the Son of God (Matt. 16:16; John 20:31). Hence, to deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Father and the Son.<p>In 1 John 2:22 we see that the principle of antichrist is to deny what Christ is. Jesus is the Christ, Christ is the Son of God, and the Son of God is the embodiment of the Father. To deny any aspect of this truth is to deny something of what Christ is and thereby to follow the principle of antichrist.<p>In verse 23 John goes on to say, &#8220;Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also.&#8221; Because the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30; Isa. 9:6), to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father. In verse 23 to deny the Son refers to the heresy that denies the deity of Christ, not confessing that the man Jesus is God.<p>First John 4:2 and 3 say, &#8220;In this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is out of God, and every spirit which does not confess Jesus, is not out of God; and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now is already in the world.&#8221; Here we see that the discernment of spirits is based upon whether or not a spirit confesses that Jesus has come in the flesh. Because the spirit of a genuine prophet is motivated by the Holy Spirit of truth, this spirit will confess the divine conception of Jesus and confirm that He was born as the Son of God.<p>Jesus was conceived of the Spirit (Matt. 1:18). To confess Jesus coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God (Luke 1:31-35). Since He was conceived of the Spirit to be born in the flesh, the Spirit would never deny that He has come in the flesh through divine conception.<p>The word &#8220;flesh&#8221; in 1 John 4:2 is very important. As human beings, we were all born of flesh to be flesh (John 3:6a). Thus every human being is flesh. To confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God. Christ is God incarnate to become a man through holy conception. He did not have a human father, for He was conceived of the Holy Spirit. Although He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, this conception took place in the womb of a virgin. Therefore, He, the very God, became a man in the flesh. Contrary to the false teaching of the Docetists, who taught that Jesus Christ was not a real man but simply appeared so, Christ&#8217;s body was not a phantasm. On the contrary, He had a real body, a physical body that was solid in its substance. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit; He became flesh and was born of the virgin Mary. Because He was conceived of the Spirit to be born in the flesh, the Spirit would never deny that He has come in the flesh through divine conception.<p>Anyone who denies that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh denies that He was conceived of the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, anyone who rejects Jesus Christ coming in the flesh rejects His humanity and His human living. Such a one also rejects Christ&#8217;s redemption. If Christ had not become a man, He could not have had human blood to shed for the redemption of human beings. If He had not become flesh through the conception of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the virgin Mary, He never could have been our substitute to be crucified to bear our judgment before God. Therefore, to deny that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is to deny His holy conception, His incarnation, His birth, His humanity, His human living, and also His redemption. The New Testament makes it emphatically clear that Christ&#8217;s redemption was accomplished in His human body and by the shedding of His blood.<p>Anyone who rejects Christ&#8217;s incarnation and thereby rejects His redemption also denies Christ&#8217;s resurrection. If Christ had never passed through death, it would not have been possible for Him to enter into resurrection.<p>Denying that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is a great heresy. This heretical teaching makes it impossible to have the enjoyment of the Trinity. According to the revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament, the Son came in the flesh with the Father and in the name of the Father. The Son was crucified, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Therefore, we have the Spirit as the reality of the Son with the Father. This includes incarnation, human living, redemption by the shedding of human blood, death in a human body, burial, and resurrection. All these are components, constituents, of our enjoyment of the Triune God. If anyone denies Christ&#8217;s incarnation, that one denies Christ&#8217;s holy birth, humanity, human living, redemption through crucifixion, and resurrection. This utterly annuls the enjoyment of the genuine Trinity.<p>In 2 John 7 the Apostle John again speaks concerning the antichrist. &#8220;Because many deceivers went out into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.&#8221; These deceivers are the liars, the false prophets, who deny that Jesus is God incarnate and in this way deny the deity of Christ. John clearly says that these deceivers are antichrists.<p>In verse 9 John continues, &#8220;Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son.&#8221; The teaching here is the teaching concerning Christ, in particular the teaching concerning the deity of Christ and His incarnation by divine conception. Today&#8217;s modernists do not have this teaching. They deny the deity of Christ and claim that His death was simply a kind of martyrdom and that it is not redemptive. This kind of teaching insults Christ&#8217;s person and annuls His work, leaving us no gospel to preach.<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:12-17 Paul deals with those who deny the resurrection. In verse 12 he says, &#8220;If Christ is preached that He has been raised from among the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?&#8221; Some of the Corinthians said heretically that there is no resurrection of the dead. In this matter they were like the Sadducees (Matt. 22:23; Acts 23:8). Denying the resurrection is most damaging and destructive to God&#8217;s New Testament economy; it is worse than the heresy of Hymenaeus and Philetus concerning resurrection in 2 Timothy 2:17 and 18. Resurrection is the life pulse and lifeline of the divine economy. If there were no resurrection, God would be the God of the dead, not the God of the living (Matt. 22:32). If there were no resurrection, Christ would not have been raised from the dead. He would be a dead Savior, not the One who lives forever (Rev. 1:18) and is able to save to the uttermost (Heb. 7:25). If there were no resurrection, there would be no living proof of justification by Christ&#8217;s death (Rom. 4:25), no imparting of life (John 12:24), no regeneration (John 3:5), no renewing (Titus 3:5), no transformation (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18), and no conformity to the image of Christ (Rom. 8:29). If there were no resurrection, there would be no members of Christ (Rom. 12:5), no Body of Christ as His fullness (Eph. 1:20-23), and no church as Christ&#8217;s bride (John 3:29) and the new man (Eph. 2:15; 4:24; Col. 3:10-11). If there were no resurrection, God&#8217;s New Testament economy would altogether collapse and God&#8217;s eternal purpose would be nullified.<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:12 Paul refers to the preaching that Christ has been raised from among the dead. This indicates clearly that the apostles preached the resurrection of Christ. According to the book of Acts, the preaching of the gospel was mainly the preaching of Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<p>In verse 13 Paul continues, &#8220;But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.&#8221; This is the first point of Paul&#8217;s rebuttal. It is a fact that Christ has been raised from among the dead. How come, then, could some say that there is no resurrection? If there were no resurrection, then Christ could not have been raised from among the dead.<p>In verse 14 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;And if Christ has not been raised, then is our preaching vain; your faith also is vain.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;vain&#8221; means empty, void. Without the living Christ in resurrection, both the preaching of the gospel and our faith in it would be empty and void, having no reality. Preaching the death of Christ without preaching His resurrection would be vain. The resurrection of Christ is what causes our preaching to become vital and prevailing. Such a preaching would never be in vain. Furthermore, apart from Christ&#8217;s resurrection, our faith would also be vain. Without the resurrection of Christ, both our preaching and our believing become vain. This is a very serious matter.<p>In verse 15 Paul says, &#8220;And we are found also false witnesses of God, because we witnessed concerning God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise if indeed the dead are not raised.&#8221; This is another strong point in Paul&#8217;s rebuttal.<p>In verse 16 Paul continues, &#8220;For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised.&#8221; Then verse 17 says, &#8220;And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;futile&#8221; means fruitless, worthless. Without Christ resurrected to live in us as our life and as everything to us, our faith in Him would be fruitless, worthless, and without any issue like the impartation of life, freedom from sin, victory over Satan, and growth in life. The word futile used here is even stronger than the word vain in verse 14. Something that is vain is empty, but the word futile indicates labor without result, work without any gain. If there is no resurrection, we may still believe, but eventually nothing results from our believing. Hence, our faith becomes futile.<p>Furthermore, according to verse 17, if Christ has not been raised, we are still in our sins. Christ&#8217;s death saves us from the condemnation of our sins, not from the power of sin. It is His resurrection life that delivers us from the power of sin (Rom. 8:2). If Christ were not resurrected, we would still remain in sins and under the power of sin.<p>Second Peter 2:1 says, &#8220;There arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.&#8221; The Greek words translated &#8220;secretly bring in&#8221; may also be rendered &#8220;bring in by smuggling.&#8221; Literally, the Greek means to bring in alongside, to bring in sideways, to introduce a new subject for which the hearers are not prepared. Here it denotes the false teachers bringing in and introducing their false teachings alongside the true ones. These false teachings are called destructive heresies, or, literally, heresies of destruction.<p>Peter tells us that the false teachers even deny the Master who bought them. &#8220;Master&#8221; implies the Lord&#8217;s person and His redemptive work. In their apostasy, the false teachers denied both the Lord&#8217;s person as the Master and His redemption, by which He purchased the believers.<p>In Jude 4 we are warned concerning the heresies of the apostates. &#8220;Certain men have crept in unnoticed, who of old have been written of beforehand for this judgment, ungodly men, perverting the grace of our God into licentiousness, and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.&#8221; Literally, the Greek words translated &#8220;crept in unnoticed&#8221; mean to get in by the side, or to slip in by a side door. The words &#8220;this judgment&#8221; refer to the judgment of the creeping in unnoticed of the apostates. Judgment here is the condemnation for punishment, and it refers to being condemned to be punished.<p>Jude speaks of ungodly men who pervert the grace of God into licentiousness and deny our Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. The evil of these heretical apostates is twofold: perverting the grace of God into wantonness, that is, into the abuse of freedom (cf. Gal. 5:13; 1 Pet. 2:16), and denying the headship and lordship of the Lord. These two go together. Turning the grace of God into an abused freedom for wantonness requires denying the Lord&#8217;s rule and authority.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><p>We have seen that the church needs to be recovered from the divisive and apostate ground with its deviation from the truths concerning the person of the Triune God and the person and work of Christ. The next matter we shall see is that we need to be brought back to the unique and pure ground of the oneness of the Body of Christ with its truths concerning the New Testament faith and God&#8217;s economy, the person and work of Christ, the person and the dispensing of the Triune God, the church, the Body of Christ, the corporate Christ, and the universal and local aspects of the church.<h2 class=head3>2. Back to the Unique and Pure Ground of the Oneness of the Body of Christ with Its Truths concerning:</h2><h2 class=head4>a. The New Testament Faith and God&#8217;s Economy</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 1:3 and 4 Paul says, &#8220;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently, nor to occupy themselves with myths and unending genealogies, which give occasion for questionings rather than God&#8217;s dispensation which is in faith.&#8221; The Greek words translated &#8220;God&#8217;s dispensation&#8221; may also be rendered &#8220;God&#8217;s household economy&#8221; (Eph. 1:10; 3:9). This is God&#8217;s household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people, that He may have a house, a household, to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ (1 Tim. 3:15). The apostle&#8217;s ministry was centered upon this economy of God (Col. 1:25; 1 Cor. 9:17), whereas the differing teachings of the dissenting ones were used by God&#8217;s enemy to distract His people from this.<p>God&#8217;s dispensation is His household economy. According to the Bible, God does not first want to have a kingdom. Rather, He first wants a house, a family. Once He has a family, His family will spontaneously become His kingdom. If He is not able to secure a family, a household, a house, He will not be able to have a kingdom. Thus, God&#8217;s dispensation is first a matter of His household economy, or family economy.<p>In 1 Timothy 1:4 Paul tells us that God&#8217;s dispensation is in faith. The dispensing of the processed Triune God into us is altogether by faith. The dispensation of God is a matter in faith, that is, in the sphere and element of faith, in God through Christ. God&#8217;s economy to dispense Himself into His chosen people is not in the natural realm, nor in the realm of the law, but in the spiritual sphere of the new creation through regeneration by faith in Christ (Gal. 3:23-26). By faith we are born of God to be His sons, partaking of His life and nature to express Him. By faith we are put into Christ to become the members of His Body, sharing all that He is for His expression. This is God&#8217;s dispensation according to His New Testament economy, carried out in faith.<p>We need to be deeply impressed with the meaning of faith in the New Testament. First, faith is God being the word spoken to us. We have God and then God as the word spoken. Through the word of God and by the Spirit of God we are infused with God in Christ. As a result, something rises up within us. This is faith. Faith then works in us to bring us into an organic union with the Triune God. Through this organic union, God is continually transfused and infused into us. As a result, we have the divine life and the divine nature to become God&#8217;s sons, members of Christ, and parts of the new man. As a totality, we become the house of God, the Body of Christ, and the new man. This is God&#8217;s dispensation in faith.<p>Jude 3 speaks of contending for the faith. &#8220;Beloved, using all diligence to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you, entreating you to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.&#8221; Faith here is not subjective; it is objective. It does not refer to our believing, but refers to our belief, to what we believe. The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith (Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 1:19; 3:9; 4:1; 5:8; 6:10, 21; 2 Tim. 2:18; 3:8; 4:7; Titus 1:13), in which we believe for our common salvation. This faith, not any doctrine, has been delivered once for all to the saints. For this faith we should contend (1 Tim. 6:12).<p>With the faith given by God there is both a subjective side and an objective side. The subjective side concerns our believing, and the objective side concerns the things we believe. In Jude 3 the faith does not denote our ability to believe; rather, it refers to what we believe. Hence, the faith refers to the contents of the New Testament.<p>Peter tells us in his second Epistle that like precious faith has been allotted to us (2 Pet. 1:1). This faith is subjective and refers to the faith that is within us. This differs from the faith in Jude 3, for faith here is objective.<p>The faith in the objective sense is equal to the contents of God&#8217;s will (the document of God&#8217;s bequests) given to us in the New Testament. This will even includes the Triune God.<p>To contend for the faith is to contend for the basic and crucial matters of God&#8217;s new testament, His new will. One of these basic matters is Christ&#8217;s death for our redemption. We need to contend for the truth concerning Christ&#8217;s redemption against the modernists. Suppose a modernist tells you that Jesus died on the cross not for redemption but because He was a martyr and sacrificed Himself for His teachings. This understanding of the death of Christ is heretical; it is contrary to one of the main items of God&#8217;s new will. We need to contend for the faith by fighting against heretical, modernistic teachings. This faith has been delivered to the saints once for all, and now we need to contend for it.<h2 class=head4>b. The Person and Work of Christ</h2><p>Concerning the person and work of Christ, we must preach that Christ is God incarnated to be a God-man, that He is both divine and human. We must also preach His redemptive death. In His redemptive work He died on the cross for our sins and for us sinners. Then He was resurrected so that He could impart Himself into us as the divine life. Therefore, the gospel we preach is that Christ, the God-man, died for our sins and was resurrected.<p>John 1:1 says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; This verse reveals that Christ, the Word, was with God and was God from the beginning. In the beginning, that is, from eternity past, the Word was with God. It is not, as supposed by some, that Christ was not with God and was not God from eternity past and that at a certain time Christ became God and was with God. Christ&#8217;s deity is eternal and absolute. From eternity past to eternity future, He is with God and He is God. This is the reason in the Gospel of John there is no genealogy regarding Him as in Matthew and Luke. In the Gospel of John He is &#8220;without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life&#8221; (Heb. 7:3). We all must be very clear that our Christ was with God and was God from the beginning.<p>In the incarnation Christ is God manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16). He was manifested in the flesh not only as the Son but as the entire God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. As the Word, who is the very God, Christ became flesh (John 1:14). Therefore, He is God-the Triune God-manifested in the flesh.<p>We need to realize that the entire God, not only the Son of God, was incarnated. John 1:14 says that the Word, which is God, became flesh. This God, who the Word is, is not a partial God; rather, He is the entire God-God the Son, God the Father, and God the Spirit. The New Testament does not say that the Word, who became flesh, was God the Son. Instead, the New Testament indicates that in the beginning was the Word, and this Word is the entire Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Hence, Christ in incarnation is the entire God manifested in the flesh.<p>Because of the influence of traditional teaching, we may think that only the Son of God, not the entire God, was incarnated. Actually, the New Testament does not say that the Son of God was incarnated; it says that God was manifested in the flesh. This means that the entire God became incarnated.<p>John 1:18 tells us, &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&#8221; The Father&#8217;s only begotten Son declared, explained, God by the Word, life (v. 4), light, grace, and reality (vv. 14, 16-17). The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized. God is fully declared in the Son through these five things.<p>In 1 Timothy 1:15 Paul refers to the redemptive work of Christ. &#8220;Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.&#8221; Christ came into the world to be our Savior by incarnation. He was God incarnated that He may save us through His death and resurrection in His human body. This should be constantly announced as the gospel, the glad tidings, in a local church.<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 we have a brief word concerning the gospel. Verses 1 and 2 say, &#8220;Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you as the gospel, unless you believed in vain.&#8221; The gospel here is the full gospel, including the teachings concerning Christ and the church, as fully disclosed in the book of Romans (1:1; 16:25). We should stand in the full gospel, that is, in the entire New Testament, not just in certain teachings or doctrines.<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:2 &#8220;being saved&#8221; literally means in the way of salvation (Conybeare). After being justified in Christ and regenerated by the Spirit, we are in the process of being saved in the life of Christ (Rom. 5:10) until we are mature and conformed to Him in full (Rom. 8:29). On the one hand, we have been saved; on the other hand, we are being saved. We have been saved by Christ&#8217;s death, but we are still being saved in His resurrection.<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:3 and 4 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.&#8221; Christ&#8217;s death for our sins, His burial for our termination, and His resurrection for our germination with life, according to the prophecies of the Old Testament (Isa. 53:5-8, 10-12; Psa. 22:14-18; Dan. 9:26; Isa. 53:9; Psa. 16:9-10; Hosea 6:2), are the basic items among the first things of the gospel. The last of these items is the most vital in the gospel, for it imparts life to us that we may live Christ.<p>The resurrection of Christ is the vitality of the gospel. There are many philosophies and religions, but none of them is vital. On the contrary, every one of them is devoid of life. Hence, none of them has any vitality. But the Lord&#8217;s gospel contains life, even resurrection life.<p>Resurrection life is a life that has conquered death, a life that entered into death, remained in death for a period of time, and then came out of death. Thus, this life is a death-conquering and death-subduing life. For this reason it is called resurrection life.<p>The gospel of Christ not only has life; it also has the life power to subdue death, to conquer death, and to annul death. This life, the life that has subdued, conquered, and nullified death, is resurrection.<h2 class=head4>c. The Person and the Dispensing of the Triune God</h2><p>The recovery of the church also requires that we be recovered to the truth concerning the person and the dispensing of the Triune God. This matter of God&#8217;s dispensing is something that is altogether missed by many Christians today. By the Lord&#8217;s mercy we have been enlightened to see that in the New Testament economy of God there is the divine, triune Person for the dispensing of Himself into His chosen people to be their life, life supply, and everything. Because this has been neglected by many today, we need to be recovered to the proper understanding and apprehension of the divine dispensing of the riches of the processed Triune God into our being.<p>It is important that we make a distinction between the words &#8220;dispensation&#8221; and &#8220;dispensing.&#8221; According to New Testament usage, the word dispensation refers to God&#8217;s arrangement, God&#8217;s plan. Dispensation is a translation of the Greek oikonomia, which is composed of two words: oikos, which means house, and nomos, which means law. Oikonomia denotes household regulations or household management. Because this word refers to a household administration and management, it implies a plan. In Ephesians 3, the word dispensation means a plan, an arrangement. Therefore, when we use the word dispensation, we mean God&#8217;s household management, God&#8217;s arrangement, God&#8217;s plan. This is different from dispensing, which is the act of God&#8217;s dispensing Himself into us. Nevertheless, in God&#8217;s dispensation the crucial matter is the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us. To be under God&#8217;s dispensation is to be under His administrative government. To be under God&#8217;s dispensing is to be under His dispensing action, His act of dispensing Himself into us.<p>God&#8217;s New Testament economy is His plan to dispense Himself into His chosen people in His trinity. This dispensing has three steps. First, it is of God the Father, who is the source, the origin. Second, this dispensing is through God the Son, who is the course. Third, God&#8217;s dispensing is in God the Spirit, who is the instrument and sphere. Through these steps of God the Father, through God the Son, and in God the Spirit the processed Triune God dispenses Himself into His chosen people.<p>Matthew 28:19 speaks of the person of the Triune God. &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The word &#8220;into&#8221; indicates union, as in Romans 6:3, Galatians 3:27, and 1 Corinthians 12:13. To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into spiritual and mystical union with Him.<p>In Matthew 28:19 there is one name for the divine Trinity-the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. The name is the sum total of the divine Being, equivalent to His person. To baptize anyone into the name of the Trinity is to baptize him into all that the Triune God is.<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 reveals the dispensing of the divine Trinity. &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&#8221; After His resurrection, the Lord charged His disciples to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). This is to bring the believing ones into the Triune God, into an organic union with the processed Triune God, who has passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and has entered into resurrection. It is based upon such an organic union that at the conclusion of 2 Corinthians Paul blesses the believers with the blessed Trinity in the participation of the Son&#8217;s grace with the Father&#8217;s love through the Spirit&#8217;s fellowship.<p>John 16:13-15 also speaks of the dispensing of the divine Trinity into the believers. Verse 13 says, &#8220;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality.&#8221; This reality is nothing less than Christ Himself. Thus, the Spirit of reality will bring us into all the reality of Christ.<p>In verse 15 the Lord says, &#8220;All that the Father has is Mine.&#8221; All that the Father is and has is the Son&#8217;s. The Son is the embodiment of the Father. All that the Father is and has is embodied in Him (Col. 2:9). All that the Father is, all the fullness of the Godhead, dwells in Christ. Therefore, the Father&#8217;s fullness is the Son&#8217;s fullness, and the Father&#8217;s life and nature are also the Son&#8217;s life and nature.<p>In verse 14, speaking of the Spirit of reality, the Lord says, &#8220;He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you.&#8221; All that the Father is and has is the Son&#8217;s, and all that the Son is and has obtained has been received by the Spirit. All of the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, and the Spirit receives this from Christ.<p>In verses 14 and 15 the Lord says that the Spirit of reality &#8220;shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you.&#8221; All that the Son is and has is revealed as reality to the believers through the Spirit. This is to glorify the Son with the Father. The Spirit discloses the Son with the Father to the believers. He makes all that Christ is and has real to us.<p>The Father, who is the source, has many riches. All that the Father has becomes the Son&#8217;s. The Son has unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8). Whatever the Father has is the Son&#8217;s, and what the Son has is received by the Spirit. Because what the Spirit receives is disclosed or transmitted to us, we become the destination. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us. All the riches of the Triune God reach us in the Spirit. Because we are organically united to the Spirit, that is, organically united to the processed Triune God, whatever He is and has now is our portion as our reality.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(5)</h1><p>In the foregoing message we saw that the recovery of the church requires that we be recovered back to the unique and pure ground of the oneness of the Body of Christ with its truths concerning the New Testament faith and God&#8217;s economy, the person and work of Christ, and the person and the dispensing of the Triune God. In this message we shall see that this recovery also involves the truth concerning the church, the Body of Christ, the corporate Christ, and the universal and local aspects of the church. We shall also see that the recovery of the church includes the building of the Body of Christ, the temple of God, the house of God, and the establishing of the kingdom life.<h2 class=head4>d. The Church, the Body of Christ, the Corporate Christ</h2><p>Ephesians 1:22-23 speaks of &#8220;the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&#8221; The Body of Christ is an organism constituted of all the believers, who have been regenerated and have God&#8217;s life, for the expression of the Head. The Body is the fullness of the Head, and the fullness is the expression of the Head.<p>Because the church is the Body of Christ and Christ is the Head of the church (Col. 1:18), the church and Christ are one Body, the mysterious, universal great man, having the same life and nature and sharing the same position and authority. Just as Christ is far above all and sits in the heavenlies (Eph. 1:20-21), so also the church sits together with Him in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:6). Just as Christ has received all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18), so also the church participates in His authority (Luke 10:19). Today the life of the church is hidden with Christ in God, and in the future the church will be manifested with Christ in glory (Col. 3:3-4). What Christ is, what Christ has, where Christ is, and what Christ does are what the church is, what the church has, where the church is, and what the church does. Christ is the life and content of the church, and the church is the organism and expression of Christ. The church receives everything from Christ, and everything of Christ is expressed through the church. The two, Christ and the church, are thus mingled and joined as one, with Christ being the inward content and the church, the outward expression.<p>Ephesians 1:23 reveals that the Body of Christ is &#8220;the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&#8221; Grammatically &#8220;the fullness&#8221; is in apposition to &#8220;His Body.&#8221; This indicates that the Body is the fullness and that the fullness is the Body. This fullness is the expression of the One, the universal Christ, who fills all in all.<p>In Ephesians 1:23 the &#8220;all in all&#8221; which Christ fills is something universal. Christ is unlimited (Eph. 3:18); He is the breadth and length and height and depth, the very dimensions of the universe. Christ thus fills all in all, and we, the church, by enjoying His riches, eventually become His fullness. The church as the Body of Christ is His fullness as His expression.<p>The Body of Christ is actually the corporate Christ. &#8220;As the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:12). In this verse Christ is not the individual Christ but the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ. In Greek &#8220;Christ&#8221; here is &#8220;the Christ,&#8221; referring to the corporate Christ, composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body with all the believers as its members. All the believers of Christ are organically united with Him and constituted of His life and element to be His Body, an organism, to express Him. Hence, He is not only the Head but also the Body. As our physical body has many members, yet is one, so is this Christ.<h2 class=head4>e. The Universal and Local Aspects of the Church</h2><p>The truth concerning the universal and local aspects of the church also needs to be recovered. In a very real sense, these matters have been lost, even annulled. Therefore, we need to be recovered to the truth concerning these two aspects of the church.<p>In the universal aspect the church is uniquely one. This aspect of the church is revealed by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16:18, where He says, &#8220;On this rock I will build My church.&#8221; What is revealed here is the universal church for the unique testimony of the Lord in the universe.<p>In 16:18 the Lord says that He will build His church upon &#8220;this rock,&#8221; which refers not only to Christ Himself but also to the revelation of Christ. The building up of the universal church is altogether on the clear revelation concerning Christ, the Son of the living God. This revelation is the crucial factor, the very center, of the building up of the universal church.<p>In Matthew 18:17 the Lord Jesus reveals the local church. The church mentioned in this verse must be a local church because it is a place where we can go. We cannot bring a problem to the universal church, only to the local church.<p>In the local aspect the church is expressed in many localities as many local churches. The one universal church expressed in many places on earth becomes the many local churches. The expression of the church in a locality is the local church in that particular locality. Without the local churches there would be no practicality and actuality of the universal church. The universal church is realized in the local churches.<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:2, where Paul addresses &#8220;the church of God which is in Corinth,&#8221; we have both the universal and the local aspects of the church. The church is of God, for it is constituted of the element of God. But the church which is of God is also local. Therefore, we have here both the universal aspect and the local aspect of the church. The universal aspect refers to the constitution, nature, and content of the church, whereas the local aspect refers to the expression and practicality of the church. If we have only the local aspect but not the aspect of the church being of God, we shall have only an outward formality, not the inward reality. But if we have only the universal aspect but not the local aspect of the church in a particular locality, we shall have the reality but not the practicality. On the one hand, the church is constituted of God; on the other hand, the church is expressed in a particular locality. The universal church is expressed and practiced in particular localities.<h2 class=head3>3. To Build the Body of Christ, the Temple of God, the House of God</h2><p>In the recovery of the church, we are building the Body of Christ, the temple of God, the house of God. This was typified by the rebuilding of the temple under the leadership of Ezra in Old Testament times. Today we are rebuilding the church life as God&#8217;s temple, the Body of Christ.<p>Ephesians 4:12-17 has much to say about the building up of the Body of Christ. Verse 12 says, &#8220;For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&#8221; In this verse &#8220;unto&#8221; means for the purpose of, for, with a view to. The many gifted persons in verse 11 have only one ministry, that of ministering Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church. This is the unique ministry in the New Testament economy (2 Cor. 4:1; 1 Tim. 1:12). Furthermore, according to the grammatical construction of verse 12, &#8220;the building up of the Body of Christ&#8221; is &#8220;the work of ministry.&#8221; Whatever the gifted persons in verse 11 do as the work of ministry must be for the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>The four special gifts in verse 11-the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherd-teachers-do not build the Body of Christ directly. Instead, these special gifts perfect the saints that they may build the Body of Christ directly. First, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers perfect, equip, the saints. This means that they build up the saints. Then the perfected saints become the building members to build the Body of Christ directly. From this we see that the Body is not built directly by the special gifts but by all the members of the Body. If we realize this, we shall avoid the great heresy of the clergy-laity system. In the church there is no clergy or laity. On the contrary, in the church every member of the Body functions to build up the Body of Christ directly.<p>In Ephesians 4:13 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&#8221; The oneness of the Spirit in Ephesians 4:3 is the oneness of the divine life in reality, whereas the oneness in verse 13 is the oneness of our living in practicality. We already have the oneness of the divine life in reality. We only need to keep it. However, we need to go on until we arrive at the oneness of our living in practicality. This aspect of oneness is of two things: the faith and the full knowledge of the Son of God. The faith here refers not to our act of believing but to the things we believe in, such as the divine person and the redemptive work of Christ for our salvation. The full knowledge of the Son of God is the realization of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience. The more we grow in life, the more we shall cleave to the faith and to the realization of Christ, and the more we shall drop all the minor and meaner doctrinal concepts which cause divisions. Then we shall arrive at, or attain to, the practical oneness; that is to say, we shall arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. A full-grown man is a mature man. Such maturity in life is needed for the practical oneness.<p>The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23), which has the stature with the measure. To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is also a necessity for the practical oneness. Hence, from the oneness of reality to the oneness of practicality we need to proceed onward until we arrive at the three things mentioned in this verse.<p>The fullness of Christ is simply the expression of Christ. As Christ&#8217;s fullness, the Body is Christ&#8217;s expression. Christ&#8217;s fullness, the Body, has a stature, and with this stature there is a certain measure. Hence, 4:13 speaks of the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.<p>To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is to arrive at the full building up of the Body of Christ. It is to arrive at the full completion of the building up of the Body.<p>In verses 14 and 15 Paul says, &#8220;That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error; but holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&#8221; &#8220;Babes&#8221; refers to those believers who are young in Christ, lacking maturity in life (1 Cor. 3:1). To be no longer babes we need to grow up into Christ. This is to have Christ increase in us in all things until we attain to a full-grown man.<p>The word &#8220;Head&#8221; in verse 15 indicates that our growth in life with Christ should be the growth of the members in the Body under the Head. This means that our growth must be in the Body. In order to grow into the Head, we must surely be in the Body.<p>In verse 16 Paul continues, &#8220;Out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&#8221; Our growth in life is to grow into the Head, Christ, but our function in the Body is to function out from Him. First, we grow up into the Head. Then we have something which is out from the Head.<p>In this verse &#8220;every joint of the supply&#8221; refers to the four special gifts mentioned in verse 11. The article before the Greek word translated &#8220;supply&#8221; is emphatic. It indicates that the supply should be a particular supply, the supply of Christ. The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers have the supply, the particular supply. Nevertheless, the Body is built up &#8220;according to the operation in measure of each one part.&#8221; &#8220;Each one part&#8221; refers to every member of the Body. Although the special gifts have the supply, the Body is not built up directly by the four special gifts. The Body is built up directly by all the members of the Body.<p>The building up of the Body of Christ is a matter of constitution. The Body is an organic entity constituted of the element of the processed Triune God. It is through such a constitution that we become the Body of Christ. Therefore, what the Body of Christ needs is not organization but a unique constitution, a constitution which consists of the divine element being dispensed into us and wrought into us. The more the processed Triune God is dispensed into us, the more the divine element becomes our constituent to make us the one Body.<p>John 2:19-21 reveals that the Body of Christ is the temple. &#8220;Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Then the Jews said, It took forty-six years to build this temple, and you will raise it up in three days? But He spoke of the temple of His body.&#8221; Satan&#8217;s ultimate aim is to destroy the house of God. This is seen in his destroying the body of Jesus on the cross. But what the enemy destroyed the Lord raised up in three days. This means that in His resurrection life the Lord built up what was destroyed by the enemy. From this we see that the enemy may damage and destroy the church, which is the house of God, but the Lord will build it up in resurrection and by resurrection. After the enemy has caused damage, the Lord, in resurrection, will rear up a building on a much larger scale.<p>When the Lord Jesus was in the flesh, His body was the tabernacle and temple of God, both of which are God&#8217;s dwelling place. Because Satan realized that the physical body of Jesus was God&#8217;s dwelling place on earth, he did his best to destroy that body, and he did destroy it on the cross through the Jews. After Satan destroyed the Lord&#8217;s physical body on the cross, His body was put into a tomb and rested there. When the Lord Jesus arose, He Himself raised up His dead and buried body. Whereas the body of Jesus that was destroyed on the cross was small and weak, the Body of Christ in resurrection is vast and powerful. This means that after the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, His Body, that is, the temple, was reared up on a much larger scale. The body the enemy destroyed by crucifixion was merely the body of Jesus. What was raised up by the Lord in resurrection was not only His own body, but everyone who was joined to Him by faith (1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6). From the day of His physical resurrection, the Lord Jesus has been enlarging His Body in resurrection life. What an immense Body Christ has today in His resurrection. Although it was once possible to measure the size of the physical body of Jesus, it is impossible to measure the immensity of the Body of Christ. The Lord continues to build His Body in resurrection, and Satan keeps on helping this.<p>The house of God is still increasing in resurrection with the Body of Christ (1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Cor. 3:9; Eph. 2:21-22). Today we are still within the &#8220;three days,&#8221; because the Lord is still working for the building of His Body under the process of resurrection. A great part of the Lord&#8217;s Body has been raised, but there are still some members of His Body who have not yet been raised. Therefore, the Lord&#8217;s Body is still in the process of resurrection.<p>All the damage that the enemy does to the church simply gives the Lord the opportunity to enlarge His Body in resurrection. Satan can never defeat the Lord Jesus. The gates of Hades can never prevail against the builded church (Matt. 16:18). The church is still going on and is still growing. Although the enemy may try his best to tear it down, we shall see the victory. We shall see that not only the Lord Jesus Himself is prevailing but that the church, His Body, the temple, also is prevailing.<p>Concerning the church as the temple of God, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 3:16 and 17, &#8220;Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you? If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, which you are.&#8221; In verse 16 &#8220;a temple of God&#8221; refers to the believers collectively in a certain locality, whereas &#8220;the temple of God&#8221; in verse 17 refers to all the believers universally. The unique spiritual temple of God in the universe has its expressions in many localities on earth. Each expression is a temple of God in that locality.<p>God&#8217;s building (1 Cor. 3:9) is the sanctuary of the holy God, the temple in which the Spirit of God dwells. We, the builders of such a holy temple, should realize this so that we may be careful to build not with the worthless materials of wood, grass, and stubble but with the precious materials of gold, silver, and precious stones (vv. 10-12), which correspond to God&#8217;s nature and economy.<p>A verse that clearly speaks of the house of God is 1 Timothy 3:15. Here Paul says, &#8220;If I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.&#8221; As God&#8217;s dwelling place, the church is both God&#8217;s house and His household, His family. In the Old Testament the temple and God&#8217;s people were two separate things, but in the fulfillment in the New Testament the dwelling place and the family are one.<p>First Timothy 3:15 and 16 reveal that the church as the house of God is also the manifestation of God in the flesh-the mystery of godliness. God is manifested in the church, the Body of Christ and the house of the living God, as the enlarged, corporate expression in the flesh. This means that the church becomes the continuation of Christ&#8217;s manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the great mystery of godliness: Christ lived out of the church, the house of the living God, as the manifestation of God in the flesh. Therefore, the church as the house of God is the continuation, the enlargement, the increase, and the expansion of God manifested in the flesh. In the church God is manifested in the flesh in a wider way according to the New Testament principle of incarnation.<h2 class=head3>4. To Establish the Kingdom Life</h2><p>Finally, the recovery of the church involves the establishing of the kingdom life. This is indicated by Paul&#8217;s word in Romans 14:17. &#8220;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This verse reveals that the kingdom of God is the living of the church. According to the context of Romans 14, the kingdom is today&#8217;s church life. The reality of the church life is the kingdom. Romans 12 speaks of the Body life and Romans 14, of the kingdom life. This indicates that, according to Romans, the kingdom life is the reality of the Body life.<p>The kingdom of God as the living of the church is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. When the authority of God&#8217;s kingdom operates in us, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily life. To have such a living is to establish the kingdom life as typified in the book of Nehemiah by the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem. Therefore, in the recovery of the church, we are building up the church as God&#8217;s house and city.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE STAGES OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>Having considered the recovery of the church, we shall begin in this message to cover the stages of the church.<h2 class=head1>XV. THE STAGES OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Seven Churches in Asia, Being Actual Local Churches, Signify Prophetically the Seven Stages Which the Church Has Gone through and Will Go through until the Lord&#8217;s Coming Back</h2><p>Revelation is a book of prophecy (Rev. 1:3; 22:7), for the revelation it contains is in the nature of prophecy. Most of the visions refer to things to come. Even the seven epistles to the seven churches in chapters two and three, in the sense of signs, are prophecies regarding the church on earth until the Lord&#8217;s coming back.<p>The seven epistles in chapters two and three of Revelation are the record of the actual situation existing in the seven churches of Asia (1:4) at the time these epistles were written. However, since this book is a book of signs with a prophetic nature, the situations of the seven churches are also signs, signifying prophetically the progress of the church in seven stages. The first epistle, to the church in Ephesus, affords a picture of the church at the end of the first stage, during the last part of the first century. The second epistle, to the church in Smyrna, prefigures the suffering church under the persecution of the Roman Empire, from the last part of the first century to the early part of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great brought the church into imperial favor. The third epistle, to the church in Pergamos, pre-symbolizes the worldly church, the church married to the world, from the time Constantine accepted Christianity to the time the papal system was established in the latter part of the sixth century. The epistle to the church in Thyatira depicts prophetically the apostate church, from the ordination of the papal system in the latter part of the sixth century to the end of this age, when Christ comes back. The fifth epistle, to the church in Sardis, prefigures the Protestant church, from the Reformation in the early part of the sixteenth century to Christ&#8217;s coming back. The sixth epistle, to the church in Philadelphia, predicts the church of brotherly love, the recovery of the proper church life, from the early part of the nineteenth century, when the brothers were raised up in England to practice the church life outside all denominational and divisive systems, to the second appearing of the Lord. The seventh epistle, to the church in Laodicea, foreshadows the degraded church life of the brothers in the nineteenth century, from the latter part of the nineteenth century until the Lord&#8217;s return.<p>If we study church history in the light of these seven epistles, we shall realize that these epistles present us a picture of the stages which the church has gone through and will go through until the Lord&#8217;s coming back. The sequence is marvelous, with each stage corresponding respectively to one of the seven churches. Therefore, the Lord&#8217;s seven epistles to the seven churches depict the stages of the church.<h2 class=head2>B. The Church in Ephesus Depicts the End of the Stage of the Initial Church during the Last Part of the First Century</h2><p>The church in Ephesus depicts the end of the stage of the initial church during the last part of the first century. Because there have been apostles not only at the beginning of the church but also later, it is better to speak of the initial church rather than the apostolic church. Ephesus depicts the church at the end of the initial period.<p>&#8220;Ephesus&#8221; in Greek means desirable. This signifies that the initial church at its end was still desirable to the Lord; the Lord still had much expectation in her.<h2 class=head3>1. Having Left the First Love toward the Lord</h2><p>At the end of his Epistle to the Ephesians Paul said a word concerning our love for the Lord Jesus. &#8220;Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility&#8221; (Eph. 6:24). First Timothy 1:17 says that God is incorruptible, and 2 Timothy 1:10 says that the Lord &#8220;nullified death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel.&#8221; First Corinthians 15 tells us that in resurrection the corruptible things will become incorruptible (vv. 50-53). To love the Lord in incorruptibility means to love Him in the new creation. All the things of the old creation are corruptible. This is proved by Romans 8 where we see that the whole creation is groaning under the slavery of corruption (vv. 21-22). Everything of the old creation is corrupting. Only the new creation is not corrupting.<p>Ephesians 6:24 is a total conclusion of the entire book of Ephesians. In the six chapters of Ephesians Paul surely reveals to us the incorruptible things. Christ is incorruptible, the church is incorruptible, and all the positive items related to Christ and the church in chapters one through six are incorruptible. We must love the Lord in these incorruptible things. This means that we must love the Lord in the new creation and not in the old creation. We must love the Lord according to the Father&#8217;s predestination unto sonship, according to the Son&#8217;s redemption, according to the Spirit&#8217;s sealing and pledging, according to the hope of God&#8217;s calling, according to the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, according to the surpassing greatness of His power which made Christ the Head of all things to the church, and according to Christ&#8217;s resurrection which made us alive, resurrected us, and seated us in the heavens. We need to love the Lord according to all the incorruptible things revealed in the six chapters of Ephesians; that is, we must love the Lord in incorruptibility.<p>To love the Lord in incorruptibility is to love Him in the regenerated and renewed spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit. If we do anything in our flesh, that is in corruptibility. I believe that when Paul was writing the book of Ephesians and was giving a conclusion to his writing, he was filled with the feeling that whatever he had taught in the preceding six chapters was incorruptible. Then he concluded by saying that we should love the Lord in incorruptibility.<p>If we would love the Lord in incorruptibility, we have to love the Lord according to everything revealed in Ephesians. At the end of Ephesians 1 is the church which is Christ&#8217;s Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. This surely does not refer to any religious organization. The church is incorruptible, but religious organizations are corruptible. To stand on the proper ground is something incorruptible. To take any ground other than that of the unique oneness of the Body of Christ kept and expressed in each local church in its locality (Rev. 1:11) is to take the ground as something corruptible. We should not love the Lord in corruptibility; we should love Him in a pure way, in the way of incorruptibility that can stand forever.<p>The Lord&#8217;s word in Revelation 2:4 indicates that the church in Ephesus did not keep Paul&#8217;s word. Here the Lord says, &#8220;I have this against you, that you have left your first love.&#8221; Although the church in Ephesus had many virtues, it was degraded because it had left its first love. The Greek word for &#8220;first&#8221; is the same as that translated &#8220;best&#8221; in Luke 15:22. Our first love toward the Lord must be the best love for Him. The church in Ephesus had left this best love toward the Lord.<p>As the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23), the church is a matter of life; as the new man (Eph. 2:15), it is a matter of the person of Christ; and as the bride of Christ (John 3:29), it is a matter of love. The first epistle to the Ephesians tells us that for the church life we need to be strengthened in our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that we, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:16-19); and that it is for the church that grace is with all them who love the Lord Jesus (Eph. 6:24). Now the second epistle to the Ephesians reveals that the degradation of the church begins with our leaving the first love toward the Lord. Nothing but love can keep us in a proper relationship with the Lord. The church in Ephesus had good works, labored for the Lord, endured suffering, and tried the false apostles, but she left her first love toward the Lord. Leaving the first love is the source of all the degradation in the following stages of the church.<h2 class=head3>2. Losing the Enjoyment of the Tree of Life</h2><p>Because the church in Ephesus left the first love toward the Lord, it lost the enjoyment of the tree of life (Rev. 2:7). In Genesis 2, in God&#8217;s creation, the tree of life is mentioned the first time. Here in Revelation 2, in God&#8217;s new creation, the tree of life is mentioned for the church&#8217;s enjoyment.<p>The tree of life is a mystery. In order to understand this mystery, we need to come to the Gospel of John, which is a book of life. John 1:4a says, &#8220;In Him was life.&#8221; &#8220;Him&#8221; here refers to Christ, the Word, who was in the beginning, who was with God, who was God, and through whom everything came into being. In Him as the Word was life. The Gospel of John fully develops the revelation concerning Christ as life to us. Eventually, in chapter fifteen, the Lord likens Himself to a tree, the vine tree. If we put together John 1:4a and 15:1, we shall realize that the tree of life, the life tree, is Christ the Son of the living God for our enjoyment. However, if, like the church in Ephesus, we leave the first love toward Him, we certainly shall lose the enjoyment of Him as the tree of life.<h2 class=head3>3. To Lose the Testimony of the Lampstand</h2><p>In Revelation 2:5 we see the consequence of the church&#8217;s degradation. Here the Lord says, &#8220;Remember therefore whence you have fallen and repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.&#8221; The consequence of the church&#8217;s degradation is losing the testimony. To lose the testimony simply means to have the lampstand removed. If we leave our first love toward the Lord and do not repent, we shall lose the testimony of the Lord and the lampstand will be removed from us. We must be careful and constantly on the alert to avoid this consequence.<p>The crucial words in the Lord&#8217;s epistle to the church in Ephesus are love, life, and light. The basic requirement for having the church life is our love toward the Lord. There is no problem, of course, with the Lord&#8217;s love toward us. He has loved us and He continues to love us. The problem is with our love toward Him. Although we have loved Him in the past and may love Him now, there is the danger that our love for the Lord Jesus might fade. The epistle to the church in Ephesus warns us of this. This epistle also gives us a clear revelation of the source of the degradation of the church life-the fading of the first love. Love gives us the position, the ground, the right, and the privilege to eat of the tree of life. Love gives us the supply of life. If we love the Lord, we shall have the full right to enjoy Him as the tree of life, as our life supply. Light always follows life, issuing out of the abundant supply of life. Life, therefore, gives us light. It is vitally important that we love the Lord. If we have love, then we shall have the life symbolized by the tree of life and the light signified by the lampstand.<h2 class=head3>4. The Lord&#8217;s Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage: to Eat of the Tree of Life in the Paradise of God</h2><p>In 2:7 we have the Lord&#8217;s promise to the overcomer. &#8220;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.&#8221; To overcome in these seven epistles means to overcome the degraded situation of the churches. In the epistle to the church in Ephesus, it means to recover our first love toward the Lord and also to hate the works of the Nicolaitans, the hierarchy which the Lord hates (v. 6).<p>In 2:7 the Lord says that to him who overcomes He will give to eat of the tree of life. For the proper church life and the recovery of the church life, that is, for the proper growth in the Christian life, what we need is not merely the mental apprehension of teachings but the eating in our spirit of the Lord as the bread of life (John 6:57). Even the words of the Scripture should not be considered merely doctrines to teach our mind but food to nourish our spirit (Matt. 4:4; Heb. 5:12-14).<p>The word for &#8220;tree&#8221; in Revelation 2:7, as in 1 Peter 2:24, is &#8220;wood&#8221; in Greek, not the usual word for tree. In the Bible the tree of life always refers to Christ as the embodiment of all the riches of God (Col. 2:9) for our food (Gen. 2:9; 3:22, 24; Rev. 22:2, 14, 19). Here it refers to the crucified (implied in the tree as a piece of wood-1 Peter 2:24) and resurrected (implied in the zoe life-John 11:25) Christ who is in the church today, the consummation of which will be the New Jerusalem, in which the crucified and resurrected Christ will be the tree of life for the nourishment of all God&#8217;s redeemed people for eternity (Rev. 22:2, 14).<p>It was God&#8217;s original intention that man should eat of the tree of life (Gen. 2:9, 16). Due to the fall, the tree of life was closed to man (Gen. 3:22-24). Through the redemption of Christ, the way to touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, has been opened again (Heb. 10:19-20). But in the church&#8217;s degradation, religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life. Hence, the Lord promises to grant the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life in the paradise of God as a reward. This is an incentive for them to leave the knowledge of religion and to return to the enjoyment of Himself.<p>The eating of the tree of life not only was God&#8217;s original intention concerning man, but it will also be the eternal issue of God&#8217;s redemption. All His redeemed people will enjoy the tree of life, which is Christ with all the divine riches as their portion for eternity (Rev. 22:2, 14, 19).<p>According to 2:7, the tree of life is in the paradise of God. The paradise of God here is not the garden of Eden; it is the coming New Jerusalem. The paradise in Luke 23:43 is the pleasant and restful place where Abraham and all the dead saints are (Luke 16:23-26). But the paradise of God in Revelation 2:7 is the New Jerusalem (3:12; 21:2, 10; 22:1-2, 14, 19) of which the church is a foretaste today. Adam was in the garden of Eden, and Abraham and all the dead saints are in paradise. We are waiting to enter into another paradise, the paradise of God in the New Jerusalem. As we are waiting for this, we have a miniature of the New Jerusalem today-the church life, where we enjoy the Lord Jesus as the tree of life. This enjoyment of the foretaste will usher us into the full taste of the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life, our nourishment of life in the New Jerusalem for eternity.<p>In today&#8217;s church life we are in paradise enjoying Christ as the tree of life. The center of the garden of Eden was the tree of life. Likewise, according to the epistle to the church at Ephesus, the tree of life will once again be the center of the paradise of God. Where is the tree of life today? According to our experience and enjoyment, the tree of life is in the church life. This means that the church life is a garden, a paradise. If we love the Lord Jesus, our church life will be a paradise, and in the center of this paradise will be the tree of life, that is, Christ as our enjoyment. The earth is a wilderness full of desolation and chaos. But the church life is a garden, and in the center of this garden we have the tree of life for our enjoyment.<p>Our experience of the tree of life in the church life today is a foretaste of the enjoyment in the coming age, when the paradise of God will be the New Jerusalem. Strictly speaking, &#8220;to eat of the tree of life...in the paradise of God&#8221; in 2:7 refers to the particular enjoyment of Christ as our life supply in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom, because this is a promise of reward made by the Lord to His overcomers. In the coming age the New Jerusalem will be a composition of all the overcomers as the heavenly part of the millennium. That heavenly part will be the paradise of God in the coming age with Christ, the tree of life, as the center for our nourishment and enjoyment.<p>The matter of eating the tree of life brings us back to the beginning, because at the beginning there was the tree of life (Gen. 2:9, 16). The tree of life always brings us back to the beginning where there is nothing but God Himself. In the church life, again and again we need to be brought back to the beginning, forgetting all other things and enjoying Christ Himself as the tree of life.<p>When we are back to the beginning with the tree of life, we enjoy Christ as the life supply. Eating the tree of life, that is, enjoying Christ as the life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life. The content of the church life depends on the enjoyment of Christ. The more we enjoy Him, the richer the content will be. But to enjoy Christ requires us to love Him with the first love. We must love Him above all things, above our work for Him and whatever we have for Him. By simply loving Him we shall be brought back to the beginning where we care for nothing except the Triune God Himself as our life supply in the tree of life. This is the proper way to maintain the church life and to be kept in the church life.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE STAGES OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the stages of the church signified by the church in Smyrna (Rev. 2:8-11) and the church in Pergamos (2:12-17).<h2 class=head2>C. The Church in Smyrna Prefigures the Suffering Church under the Persecution of the Roman Empire from the Last Part of the First Century to the Early Part of the Fourth Century</h2><p>In Greek &#8220;Smyrna&#8221; means myrrh, a sweet spice which, in figure, signifies suffering. In typology, myrrh signifies the sweet suffering of Christ. Thus, the church in Smyrna was a suffering church, prefiguring the church under the persecution of the Roman Empire from the latter part of the first century to the early part of the fourth century. This persecuted church suffered in the sweetness and fragrance of Christ. In other words, this church was in the tribulation of Jesus and in the fellowship of His sufferings. The church in Smyrna suffered as Christ Himself did and thereby became a continuation of His suffering.<p>In Colossians 1:24 Paul tells us that he filled up &#8220;that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church.&#8221; The afflictions of Christ are of two categories: those for accomplishing redemption, which have been completed by Christ Himself, and those for producing and building the church, which need to be filled up by the apostles and the believers. Although no one can continue Christ&#8217;s redemption, His sufferings must be completed by all His followers both individually and collectively. In the church in Smyrna we see the collective continuation of the sufferings of Jesus. Because this church was a continuation of Jesus&#8217; suffering, it was truly the testimony of Jesus.<h2 class=head3>1. Suffering the Slander of the Jews</h2><p>In Revelation 2:9 the Lord Jesus said that He knew &#8220;the slander of those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.&#8221; This indicates that persecution came from religion, from the unbelieving Jews of the synagogue of Satan. The slander of the Judaizers toward the suffering church was their evil criticism of her. The Judaizers were Jews in the flesh but not in spirit (Rom. 2:28-29). Merely being the seed of Abraham in the flesh did not constitute them true Jews. &#8220;Those who are the children of the flesh are not the children of God&#8221; (Rom. 9:8). Therefore, the Lord said that they &#8220;call themselves Jews and are not.&#8221; These Judaizers stubbornly insisted upon keeping their Judaistic system, consisting of the Levitical priesthood, the sacrificial rituals, and the material temple, which were all types now fulfilled and replaced by Christ. Because the church under the new covenant in God&#8217;s economy had no part in their religious practice, the Judaizers slanderously criticized her.<p>The Lord said that those who called themselves Jews and are not are &#8220;a synagogue of Satan,&#8221; a terrible term. A synagogue was a place where the Jews worshipped God mainly by studying their Scriptures, the Old Testament. However, due to their stubbornness in clinging to their traditional, religious concepts, they became one with Satan in opposing God&#8217;s way of life to fulfill His purpose (Matt. 12:9-14; Luke 4:28-29; John 9:22; Acts 6:9, 11-14; 13:43, 45-46, 50; 14:1-2, 19; 17:1, 5-6; Rev. 3:9). Therefore, the Lord called them a synagogue of Satan.<h2 class=head3>2. Suffering the Persecution of the Roman Empire in Ten Periods of Time</h2><p>In Revelation 2:10a the Lord says, &#8220;Do not fear what<p>you are about to suffer. Behold, the Devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation ten days.&#8221; Verse 9 speaks of Satan and verse 10, of the Devil. In Greek Satan means adversary. He is not only the enemy of God from without but also His adversary from within. The Greek word diabolos, translated Devil, means accuser, slanderer (Rev. 12:9-10). The Devil, who is Satan, the adversary of God, accuses us before God and slanders us before men. The persecution suffered by the church began from the religious synagogue of the Jews instigated by Satan, the adversary, and it was consummated by the Roman Empire used by the Devil, the slanderer. The persecution of the suffering church was a cooperation of devilish politics and satanic religion.<p>In 2:10 the Lord speaks of the church in Smyrna having tribulation &#8220;ten days.&#8221; Ten is a number for fullness, such as the Ten Commandments, which express God&#8217;s demand in full. Ten days in the Bible signify a period of time which is full yet short (Gen. 24:55; Jer. 42:7; Dan. 1:12-14). Hence, it signifies that the tribulation of the suffering church was full yet short. As a sign, these ten days indicate prophetically the ten periods of persecution which the church suffered under the Roman Emperors, beginning with Caesar Nero in the second half of the first century and ending with Constantine the Great in the first part of the fourth century.<h2 class=head3>3. The Lord&#8217;s Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</h2><p>In Revelation 2:10b and 11 we have the Lord&#8217;s promise to the overcomers of this stage. To overcome in this epistle means to overcome persecution by being faithful unto death.<h2 class=head4>a. To Be Given a Crown of Life</h2><p>&#8220;Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life&#8221; (2:10b). Here, as elsewhere in the New Testament, the crown denotes a prize in addition to salvation. The crown of life as a prize to those who are faithful unto death in overcoming persecution denotes the overcoming strength, which is the power of the resurrection life (Phil. 3:10); it also signifies that these overcomers have attained to &#8220;the out-resurrection from among the dead,&#8221; that is, the outstanding resurrection (Phil. 3:11).<p>To the church in Ephesus Christ promises to give the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life. To the church in Smyrna He promises to give the overcomers the crown of life. The eating of the tree of life is for inward supply, and the crown of life is for outward glory. Both promises are wrapped up with the divine life. This life must first be our food, and then it will be our expression and our glorification as the crown of life.<h2 class=head4>b. Not to Be Hurt of the Second Death</h2><p>The promise to the overcomers in this stage of the church has both a positive side and a negative side. The positive side is receiving the crown of life, and the negative side is not being hurt of the second death. &#8220;He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death&#8221; (Rev. 2:11b). The second death is God&#8217;s dealing with man after man&#8217;s death and resurrection. It is, therefore, the final settlement (Rev. 20:11-15). Because the overcomers have overcome death through their faithfulness unto death under persecution and have left nothing requiring further dealing by God, after their resurrection they will not be &#8220;hurt,&#8221; touched, by the second death, the death after resurrection. This indicates that those who do not overcome persecution will be hurt by the second death. This is for a believer to suffer some dealing from the Lord after he has been resurrected. Those who do not overcome will not receive the crown of life but will instead be hurt by the second death. However, those who overcome persecution and tribulation by the resurrection life within them will receive the crown of life positively and will not be hurt by the second death negatively. This is the Lord&#8217;s clear promise in His clear word.<h2 class=head2>D. The Church in Pergamos Pre-symbolizes the Worldly Church, the Church Married to the World, from the Day Constantine Accepted Christianity in the Early Part of the Fourth Century to the Time the Papal System Was Established in the Latter Part of the Sixth Century</h2><p>In Greek &#8220;Pergamos&#8221; means &#8220;marriage,&#8221; implying union, and &#8220;fortified tower.&#8221; As a sign, the church in Pergamos prefigures the church which entered into a marriage union with the world and became a high fortified tower, the equivalent of the great tree prophesied by the Lord in the parable of the mustard seed (Matt. 13:31-32). When Satan failed to destroy the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire in the first three centuries, he changed his strategy. He sought instead to corrupt her through Constantine&#8217;s welcoming her as the state religion in the first part of the fourth century. Through Constantine&#8217;s encouragement and political influence, multitudes of unbelieving ones were baptized into the &#8220;church,&#8221; and the &#8220;church&#8221; became monstrously great. Because the church, as a chaste bride, is the spouse to Christ, her union with the world is considered spiritual fornication in the eyes of God.<p>According to the facts of history, during the first three centuries, the church suffered a great deal as the Roman Empire tried its best to damage her. Eventually, Satan realized that persecution did not work very well. Therefore, being the subtle one, he changed his strategy from persecuting the church to welcoming her. In the early part of the fourth century, Constantine the Great accepted Christianity and made it a state religion. From that time onward, Christianity became a kind of Roman state church. This welcoming of the church by the Roman Empire ruined her because it caused the church to become worldly. The church has been called out of the world and has been separated from the world to God for the fulfillment of His purpose. However, by being welcomed by the Roman Empire, the church went back to the world and, in the eyes of God, even married the world.<p>Due to this marriage, the church lost her purity and became worldly. Because the church had entered into union with the world, many worldly things came into the church. Worldly things are related to idol worship, for worldliness is always associated with idolatry. First, the church in Pergamos became worldly and then idolatrous. Satan saturated her with the world and with idols. As a result, the church became absolutely different from what God intended her to be. God desires a church which is outside the world, having nothing to do with the world. The church must be a golden lampstand, the pure expression of the processed Triune God, and have no connections with the world. But after the Roman Empire had made the church a worldly religion, she became impure, worldly, and idolatrous.<p>Revelation 2:12-17 corresponds to Matthew 13:31-32. The church should be like an herb to produce food, but it became a &#8220;tree,&#8221; a lodge for birds, having its nature and function changed. This happened when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world, bringing in thousands of false believers. At that time, the mustard herb became a great tree-Christendom, the worldly church, the church married to the world.<h2 class=head3>1. Getting Settled in the World Where Satan&#8217;s Throne Is</h2><p>In Revelation 2:13 the Lord Jesus said to the church in Pergamos, &#8220;I know where you dwell, where Satan&#8217;s throne is.&#8221; Satan&#8217;s dwelling place is the world. Because the church entered into union with the world and became worldly herself, she began to dwell where Satan dwells-in the world. The church in Pergamos also dwelt where Satan&#8217;s throne is. This again refers to the world, which is not only Satan&#8217;s dwelling place but also the sphere wherein he rules.<h2 class=head3>2. Holding the Teaching of the Gentile Prophet to Eat Idol Sacrifices and to Commit Fornication</h2><p>In 2:14 the Lord said, &#8220;I have a few things against you, because you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication.&#8221; Balaam was a Gentile prophet who caused God&#8217;s people to stumble. For the sake of reward (2 Pet. 2:15; Jude 11), he brought fornication and idolatry to God&#8217;s people (Num. 25:1-3; 31:16). In the worldly church some began to teach the same things. When the worldly church disregarded the name, the person, of the Lord, she turned to idolatry, which issued in fornication. The teachings of Balaam always cause people to enter into union with the worldly things. This is to eat idol sacrifices and to commit spiritual fornication.<p>Fornication actually denotes confusion. According to God&#8217;s holy ordination, a woman should have only one husband. To have more than one husband is to commit fornication, and this brings in confusion. Spiritual fornication is fully related to idol worship. We should love God, our unique Husband. But if we worship idols, we make these idols husbands to us. Hence, in principle, worshipping idols is the same as fornication.<h2 class=head3>3. Holding the Teaching of Clergy to Build Up Hierarchy</h2><p>In Revelation 2:15 the Lord went on to say, &#8220;You also have those who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&#8221; &#8220;Nicolaitans&#8221; is an equivalent of the Greek word nikolaitai, the root of which is nikolaos, composed of two words: niko, meaning &#8220;conquer&#8221; or &#8220;above others&#8221; and laos, meaning &#8220;common people,&#8221; &#8220;secular people,&#8221; or &#8220;laity.&#8221; Hence, nikolaos means &#8220;conquering the common people,&#8221; &#8220;climbing above the laity.&#8221; The Nicolaitans, then, must refer to a group of people who esteemed themselves higher than the common believers. In the church in Pergamos their works (Rev. 2:6) progressed into a teaching. They not only practiced the hierarchy but also taught it. This hierarchy destroys the function of the believers as members of the Body of Christ, thus annulling the Lord&#8217;s Body in expressing Him.<h2 class=head3>4. The Lord&#8217;s Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</h2><p>In 2:17 we have the Lord&#8217;s promise to the overcomers of this stage. To overcome here means specifically to overcome the church&#8217;s union with the world, the teaching of idolatry and fornication, and the teaching of the hierarchy.<h2 class=head4>a. To Be Given to Eat the Hidden Manna</h2><p>In 2:17b the Lord says, &#8220;To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna.&#8221; Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food enabling God&#8217;s people to go His way. A portion of that manna was preserved in a golden pot concealed in the ark (Exo. 16:32-34; Heb. 9:4). The open manna was for the enjoyment of the Lord&#8217;s people in a public way; the hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply. This promise is fulfilled today in the proper church life and will be fulfilled in full in the coming kingdom.<p>The promise to the first church concerns the eating of the tree of life, and the promise to this church concerns the eating of the hidden manna. The worldlier the church becomes, the greater is the need for some to stand up and testify and to maintain intimate fellowship with the Lord. These will be privileged to enjoy the Lord as the hidden manna.<p>The placing of the hidden manna in a golden pot signifies that the hidden Christ is concealed in the divine nature (signified by gold). Whereas the open manna is for all the people of God, the hidden manna is for those who are intimate with the Lord, those who have forsaken the world and every separation between them and God. They come into the intimacy of God&#8217;s presence, and here in this divine intimacy they enjoy the hidden manna in God&#8217;s nature. This enjoyment is so inward that those who eat of the hidden manna are actually in the divine nature enjoying the hidden Christ.<h2 class=head4>b. To Become Transformed Stones for the Building of God, Justified and Approved by the Lord</h2><p>The Lord also promised the overcomer in Revelation 2:17 that He &#8220;will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.&#8221; A stone in the Bible signifies material for God&#8217;s building (Matt. 16:18; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Cor. 3:12). In our natural being we are not stones but clay. Because we have received the divine life with its divine nature through regeneration, we can be transformed into stones, even precious stones, by enjoying Christ as our life supply (2 Cor. 3:18). Those who do not follow the worldly church but enjoy the Lord in the proper church life will be transformed into stones for the building of God. As indicated by the color white, these stones will be justified and approved by the Lord. The overcomers will be justified by God and approved by the Lord. Therefore, they will be the materials for the building up of God&#8217;s temple according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE STAGES OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover two further stages of the church, the stages signified by the church in Thyatira (Rev. 2:18-29) and the church in Sardis (3:1-6).<h2 class=head2>E. The Church in Thyatira Pre-symbolizes the Apostate Church, from the Ordination of the Papal System in the Latter Part of the Sixth Century to the End of the Church Age</h2><p>The church in Thyatira is the church in apostasy. &#8220;Thyatira&#8221; in Greek means &#8220;sacrifice of perfume&#8221; or &#8220;unceasing sacrifice.&#8221; As a sign, the church in Thyatira prefigures the Roman Catholic Church, which was fully formed as the apostate church by the establishment of the universal papal system in the latter part of the sixth century. This apostate church is full of sacrifices, as demonstrated in her unceasing mass. This apostate church will remain until the Lord&#8217;s coming back.<h2 class=head3>1. Doing Many Works</h2><p>In 2:19 the Lord says, &#8220;I know your works and love and faith and service and your endurance, and that your last works are more than the first.&#8221; The apostate Catholic Church has many works and services. Her works in the last days are more than in the past.<h2 class=head3>2. As a Continuation of the Worldly Church, Pre-symbolized by the Church in Pergamos, Keeping the Teaching of the Gentile Prophet Balaam and the Teaching of a Clerical System</h2><p>The church in Thyatira is a continuation of the worldly church, pre-symbolized by the church in Pergamos. The church in Pergamos had the teaching of the Gentile prophet Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans, that is, the teaching of a clerical system. The Catholic Church continues these teachings, the teaching of Balaam to bring people into idol worship and fornication and the teaching of the Nicolaitans to build up the hierarchy. In the Catholic Church today there is a strong teaching concerning the building up of a religious organization with its hierarchy.<h2 class=head3>3. Considering Herself a Prophetess, Symbolized by the Woman Jezebel, to Teach and Lead the Lord&#8217;s Slaves Astray to Commit Fornication and to Eat Idol Sacrifices, That Is, to Hide the Leaven (Evil, Heretical, and Pagan Things) in Three Measures of Meal (Christ as the Meal Offering for the Satisfaction of God and Man), as Prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33</h2><p>One of the crucial points in the epistle to the church in Thyatira concerns the woman Jezebel. The Lord refers to her in verse 20. &#8220;I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices.&#8221; This is the very woman prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33, the woman who added leaven (signifying evil, heretical, and pagan things) into the fine flour (signifying Christ as the meal offering for the satisfaction of God and man). This woman is also the great prostitute of Revelation 17, who mixes abominations with the divine things. The pagan wife of Ahab, Jezebel, was a type of this apostate church.<p>In verse 20 the Lord indicates that the apostate church is a self-appointed prophetess. A prophet is one who speaks for God with His authorization. The apostate Catholic Church presumes to be authorized by God to speak for Him. She demands that people listen to her rather than to God. Her adherents are all drugged by her heretical, religious teaching, not caring for Christ as their life and life supply, as indicated by the tree of life and the hidden manna promised by the Lord to the churches in Ephesus and Pergamos (2:7, 17).<p>Matthew 13:33 says, &#8220;Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.&#8221; Sound teachers of the Bible recognize that the Jezebel in Revelation 2:20 is the same woman prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33. The great harlot in Revelation 17 is also the same woman. Thus, the woman in Matthew 13 is the Jezebel in Revelation 2, and Jezebel becomes the great harlot who is called the great Babylon in Revelation 17. The Jezebel in the Old Testament (1 Kings 16:31) was a prefigure of &#8220;the woman Jezebel&#8221; in Revelation 2:20. When the Lord spoke to the church in Thyatira, He said that there was a present-day Jezebel. According to history, this present-day Jezebel undoubtedly is the apostate church, the Roman Catholic Church. In using the name Jezebel, the Lord was reminding us of what Jezebel, the wife of Ahab, did. She came from a heathen background and brought pagan things into the worship of God by His people. This is the crucial and most central point in the epistle to Thyatira. The principle of the deeds of the apostate church is to mix the heathen, pagan things with the worship of God by His people. She helps God&#8217;s people to worship Him, but she does not do so in God&#8217;s way; rather, she does it in her own heathen, pagan way.<p>The Roman Catholic Church has leavened everything related to Christ. This is indicated by the words &#8220;the whole was leavened&#8221; in Matthew 13:33. The Roman Catholic Church does have Christ, the meal, but it has put leaven into the meal.<h2 class=head3>4. The Lord&#8217;s Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</h2><p>In Revelation 2:26 and 27 we have the Lord&#8217;s promise to the overcomers of this stage. In verse 26 He says, &#8220;He who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations.&#8221; To overcome here means to overcome Catholicism. The overcomers, the rest in Thyatira, do not have Jezebel&#8217;s teaching (v. 24), have not known the deep things of Satan, hold fast the Lord&#8217;s testimony until He comes (v. 25), and keep the Lord&#8217;s works until the end. &#8220;My works&#8221; in verse 26 refers to the things the Lord has accomplished and is doing, such as His crucifixion, resurrection, and intercession, in contrast to the works of the apostate church under the influence of Satan.<h2 class=head4>a. To Be Given Authority over the Nations and to Shepherd Them with an Iron Rod</h2><p>In verse 26 the Lord says that to the one who overcomes He will give authority over the nations. This is a prize to the overcomers of reigning with Christ over the nations in the millennial kingdom (20:4, 6). This promise of the Lord strongly implies that those who do not answer His call to overcome the apostate church will not participate in the reign of the millennial kingdom.<p>In verse 27 the Lord, speaking of the overcomer, goes on to say, &#8220;And he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father.&#8221; In the millennial kingdom the ruler will be a shepherd. In Psalm 2:9 God gave Christ authority to rule over the nations. Here Christ gives the same authority to His overcomers.<h2 class=head4>b. To Be Given the Morning Star (the Coming Christ)</h2><p>In 2:28 we have another aspect of the Lord&#8217;s promise to the overcomer in this stage. He says, &#8220;I will give him the morning star.&#8221; The morning star here refers to the coming Christ. At Christ&#8217;s first coming, the wise men, not the Jewish religionists, saw His star (Matt. 2:2, 9-10). At His second coming, He will be the morning star to His overcomers, who watch for His coming. To all the others, He will appear only as the sun (Mal. 4:2). Only the hidden overcomers, those who enjoy Christ as the hidden manna, will see the hidden Christ appearing as the morning star to those who love Him.<h2 class=head2>F. The Church in Sardis Prefigure  the Protestant Church, from the Reformation in the Early Part of the Sixteenth Century to Christ&#8217;s Coming Back</h2><p>&#8220;Sardis&#8221; in Greek means &#8220;the remains,&#8221; &#8220;the remainder,&#8221; or &#8220;the restoration.&#8221; As a sign, the church in Sardis prefigures the Protestant Church from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ. The Reformation was God&#8217;s reaction to the apostate Roman Catholic Church, signified by the degraded church in Thyatira. The Reformation was accomplished by a minority of the believers, the remainder. Hence, it was the restoration by the remainder.<h2 class=head3>1. Living in Name but Actually Dead</h2><p>To the messenger of the church in Sardis the Lord says, &#8220;I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead&#8221; (Rev. 3:1). The reformed Protestant Church has been considered by many to be living, but the Lord says that she is dead. Hence, in her dead condition, she needs the seven living Spirits and the shining stars. In name the Protestant denominations are living and are better than the Catholic Church. Actually, the Protestant denominations are dead.<h2 class=head3>2. All the Restored Things Being Not Completed but About to Die</h2><p>In verse 2 the Lord says to &#8220;establish the things which remain, which were about to die.&#8221; &#8220;The things which remain&#8221; are the things lost and restored by the Reformation, such as justification by faith and the open Bible. Although these things were restored, they &#8220;were about to die.&#8221; Hence, the Protestant Church needs revivals to keep things alive.<p>In verse 2 the Lord also says, &#8220;I have not found your works completed before My God.&#8221; Nothing begun in the Reformation has been completed by the Protestant churches. Therefore, the church in Philadelphia (3:7-13), signifying the church in recovery, is needed for the completion. In the eyes of God, there are no completed works in the so-called reformed churches.<h2 class=head3>3. The Lord&#8217;s Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</h2><p>In 3:5 we have the Lord&#8217;s promise to the overcomers of this stage. To overcome here means to overcome the deadness of the Protestant churches, that is, to overcome dead Protestantism. The whole of verse 5 is the Lord&#8217;s promise to the overcomers. It will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom after He comes back.<h2 class=head4>a. To Be Clothed in White Garments, Signifying Their Walk and Living, Pure and Approved by the Lord, for Them to Walk with the Lord</h2><p>In 3:4 the Lord says, &#8220;But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.&#8221; Garments in the Bible signify what we are in our walk and living. To defile the garments means particularly to stain them with deadness. Death is more defiling before God than sin (Lev. 11:24-25; Num. 6:6, 7, 9). In this verse the defilement denotes anything of the death nature. The defilement in Sardis was not the defilement of sin but the defilement of death.<p>Speaking of those who have not defiled their garments, the Lord says, &#8220;They shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.&#8221; White not only signifies purity but also approvedness. White garments here signify the walk and living which are unspotted by death and which will be approved by the Lord. It is a qualification for walking with the Lord, especially in the coming kingdom.<p>If you read the context of Revelation 2 and 3, you will see that every time the Lord makes a promise in these seven epistles, it, strictly speaking, refers to the coming kingdom. It never refers to our eternal destiny but to our future in the coming kingdom. This is the basic and governing principle in understanding all the promises in these seven epistles. In 3:4 the Lord promises that the living ones, those who have not defiled their garments, will walk with Him in white. This will be during the millennium. To walk with the Lord in white means to walk with Him during those thousand years.<p>In 3:5a the Lord says, &#8220;He who overcomes, he shall be clothed in white garments.&#8221; This will be a prize to the overcomers in the millennial kingdom. In what they have been walking in this age will be a prize to them in the coming age.<p>Being clothed in white garments involves our experience of Christ as the second of the two garments needed by every Christian. The first garment is the garment of salvation, signifying Christ as our righteousness objectively. In Luke 15, when the prodigal son returned home, the father had the best robe prepared for him. The first thing the father did was to have this robe placed upon his returned son. Wearing that robe, the prodigal son was justified in the presence of the father. This means that he was justified in Christ and that Christ had become his justifying covering. He was covered by Christ as His righteousness. Thus, the garment of justification, the first garment, is for salvation. However, in addition to this, we need another garment to make us approved and well-pleasing to the Lord. The &#8220;fine linen, bright and pure&#8221; in Revelation 19:8 denotes this second garment. This garment is not a matter of Christ as our objective righteousness but of experiencing Christ as our subjective righteousness. This garment is for the reward. The white garments mentioned in 3:5 refer to the second garment.<h2 class=head4>b. To Have Their Names Remain in the Book of Life in the Millennium</h2><p>Concerning the overcomer in this stage of the church, the Lord says in 3:5b, &#8220;I will by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.&#8221; The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings God has prepared for them. These blessings are in three stages: the church, the millennial kingdom, and eternity. All the believers will share in the blessings of the first and third stages, but only the overcomers will share in the blessings of the second stage, that is, the blessings in the millennial kingdom. Those who cooperate with God&#8217;s supplying grace and mature in life in the church age will be given the prize of the entrance into the millennial kingdom and the participation in the divine blessings in that stage. This means that their names will not be erased out of the book of life during the millennium. The names of all the genuine believers have been written in the book of life. However, during the millennium, the names of some, the defeated ones, will be deleted, whereas the names of the overcomers will remain in the book of life during the coming age of the millennial kingdom.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE STAGES OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover the last two stages of the church signified by the church in Philadelphia (Rev. 3:7-13) and the church in Laodicea (3:14-22).<h2 class=head2>G. The Church in Philadelphia Prefigures the Church of Brotherly Love, the Recovery of the Proper Church Life, from the Early Part of the Nineteenth Century to the Second Appearing of the Lord</h2><p>In Greek, &#8220;Philadelphia&#8221; means brotherly love. As a sign, the church in Philadelphia prefigures the proper church life recovered by the brothers who were raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century. Just as the reformed church, prefigured by the church in Sardis, was a reaction to the apostate Catholic Church, prefigured by the church in Thyatira, so the church of brotherly love is a reaction to the dead reformed church. This reaction will continue as an anti-testimony to both apostate Catholicism and degraded Protestantism until the Lord comes back.<h2 class=head3>1. Keeping the Lord&#8217;s Word with the Little Power She Has</h2><p>In 3:8b the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;You have a little power and have kept My word.&#8221; One outstanding feature of the church in Philadelphia is that she kept the Lord&#8217;s word. According to history, no other Christians have kept the Lord&#8217;s word as strictly as those in the church in Philadelphia. The church in Philadelphia, the recovered church, does not care for tradition; she cares for the word of God.<p>The church in Philadelphia keeps the Lord&#8217;s word with the little power she has. We should not regard the church in Philadelphia as being strong, powerful, and prevailing. Whereas we may estimate the church in Philadelphia very highly, the Lord says that she had &#8220;a little power.&#8221; What pleases the Lord is not that we are strong but that we use our little power to do the best we can. The strong ones may not please the Lord as much as those who do their best with the little power they have.<h2 class=head3>2. Not Denying the Lord&#8217;s Name as the Denominated Sects</h2><p>In 3:8 the Lord also says that the church in Philadelphia has not denied His name. The brothers who were raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century did not take any name other than the name of the Lord. The word is the Lord&#8217;s expression, and the name is the Lord Himself. The apostate church has deviated from the Lord&#8217;s word and has become heretical. The reformed church, though recovered to the Lord&#8217;s word to some extent, has denied the Lord&#8217;s name by denominating herself with many other names. The recovered church has not only returned to the Lord&#8217;s word in a full way but has also abandoned all names other than that of the Lord Jesus Christ. The recovered church belongs to the Lord absolutely, having nothing to do with any denominations (any names). To deviate from the Lord&#8217;s word is apostasy, and to denominate the church with any name other than the Lord&#8217;s is spiritual fornication. The church as the chaste virgin betrothed to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2) should not have any name other than her Husband&#8217;s. All other names are an abomination in the eyes of God. In the recovered church life we have no teachings of Balaam (Rev. 2:14), no teachings of the Nicolaitans (2:15), no teachings of Jezebel (2:20), and no mysterious doctrines of Satan (2:24); we have only the pure word of the Lord. Likewise, the recovered church has no denominations (names) but the unique name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The deviation from the Word to heresies and the exaltation of so many names other than that of Christ are the most striking signs of degraded Christianity. The return to the pure Word from all heresies and traditions and the exaltation of the Lord&#8217;s name by abandoning every other name are the most inspiring testimony in the recovered church.<h2 class=head3>3. Given an Open Door Which No One Can Shut</h2><p>In 3:8a the Lord says, &#8220;I know your works; behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut.&#8221; As the One who has the key of David and who opens and no one shall shut (v. 7), the Lord has given the recovered church &#8220;an open door which no one can shut.&#8221; Since the recovery of the proper church life began, in the early part of the nineteenth century, until now, a door has always been wide open to the Lord&#8217;s recovery. The more that organized Christianity tries to shut the door, the wider it is open. In spite of much opposition, the door today is open worldwide. The key is in the hand of the Head of the church; it is not in the hand of the opposers.<h2 class=head3>4. Subduing the Judaizers and Their Judaic Teachings</h2><p>The church in Philadelphia subdues the Judaizers and their Judaic teachings. Whereas the Catholic Church has brought in many Judaic things, adopting many of the Old Testament practices, the brothers in the recovered church in the early nineteenth century abandoned all Judaic teachings.<p>Concerning the subduing of the Judaizers and their teachings, the Lord says in 3:9, &#8220;Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, those who call themselves Jews and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause them to come and worship before your feet, and they shall know that I have loved you.&#8221; The Jewish synagogue holds on to Judaism, which comprises the mediatorial priests, the ordinances of letters, the material temple, and the earthly promises. The recovered church has subdued Judaism by exposing its error and stubbornness in holding on to the above four things and has made the Jews know that the Lord has loved her.<h2 class=head3>5. Promised to Be Kept Out of the Hour of Trial Which Is about to Come on the Whole Inhabited Earth</h2><p>&#8220;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth&#8221; (3:10). This promise actually refers to the rapture of the overcomers before the great tribulation. &#8220;Trial&#8221; in 3:10 undoubtedly denotes the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21) &#8220;which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth,&#8221; as indicated by the fifth, sixth, and seventh trumpets with the seven bowls (Rev. 8:13-9:21; 11:14-15; 15:1; 16:1-2). The &#8220;trial&#8221; may also include the supernatural calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets. The Lord promises the recovered church that He will keep her &#8220;out of the hour of trial&#8221; (not only out of the trial but out of the hour of trial) because she has kept the word of His endurance. This promise of the Lord, like that in Luke 21:36, indicates that the saints who have kept the word of the Lord&#8217;s endurance will be raptured before the great trial.<h2 class=head3>6. The Lord&#8217;s Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</h2><p>In Revelation 3:11 and 12 we have the Lord&#8217;s promise to the overcomers in Philadelphia. To overcome in this epistle means to hold fast what we have in the recovered church.<h2 class=head4>a. To Receive a Crown</h2><p>In verse 11 the Lord says, &#8220;I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown.&#8221; The recovered church has gained the crown already. However, if she does not hold fast what she has in the Lord&#8217;s recovery until the Lord comes back, her crown may be taken away by someone. Being a reward from the Lord, this crown needs to be kept until He comes back.<h2 class=head4>b. To Be Made a Pillar in the Temple of God for God&#8217;s Building</h2><p>In 3:12a the Lord says, &#8220;He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore.&#8221; In 2:17 the overcomer becomes a transformed stone for God&#8217;s building. Here the overcomer will be made a pillar built into the temple of God. Because he is built into God&#8217;s building, &#8220;he shall by no means go out anymore.&#8221; This promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom as a prize to the overcomer.<h2 class=head4>c. To Be the Components of the New Jerusalem in the Millennium, Bearing the Name of God, the Name of God&#8217;s City, and the Lord&#8217;s New Name</h2><p>In 3:12b the Lord goes on to say concerning the overcomer, &#8220;I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.&#8221; Here the Lord speaks of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is not a physical city but a composition of the believers. This composition will appear first in the millennium as the totality of all the overcomers. These overcomers will bear the name of God because they have God&#8217;s nature in them; and they will bear the name of God&#8217;s city because they are God&#8217;s city. This means that the overcomers will be the New Jerusalem. The name of God and the name of the New Jerusalem written upon them will describe their nature and declare what they are. Furthermore, they will bear the new name of the Lord whom they have experienced in a particular way.<p>The name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the Lord&#8217;s new name written upon the overcomer indicate that the overcomer is possessed by God, by the New Jerusalem, and by the Lord; that God Himself, His city, the New Jerusalem, and the Lord Himself all belong to him; and that he is one with God, with the New Jerusalem, and with the Lord. The name of God means God Himself, the name of the New Jerusalem means the city itself, and the name of the Lord means the Lord Himself. To write the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the name of the Lord upon the overcomer indicates that what God is, the nature of the New Jerusalem, and the person of the Lord have all been wrought into the overcomer.<h2 class=head2>H. The Church in Laodicea Foreshadows the Degraded Church Life of the Brothers from the Latter Part of the Nineteenth Century to the Lord&#8217;s Return</h2><p>In Greek &#8220;Laodicea&#8221; means the opinion, the judgment, of the people or of the laymen. The church in Laodicea as a sign prefigures the degraded recovered church. Less than a century after the Lord recovered the proper church in the early part of the nineteenth century, some of the recovered churches (&#8220;assemblies&#8221;) became degraded. This degraded recovered church differs from the reformed church signified by the church in Sardis; it also differs from the proper recovered church signified by the church in Philadelphia. The degraded recovered church, signified by Laodicea, will exist until the Lord comes back.<h2 class=head3>1. Becoming Lukewarm</h2><p>&#8220;I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish you were cold or hot. So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to vomit you out of My mouth&#8221; (3:15-16). Once the recovered church becomes degraded, it is lukewarm-neither cold nor hot.<h2 class=head3>2. To Be Vomited Out of the Lord&#8217;s Mouth</h2><p>According to verse 16b, the Lord is about to vomit the lukewarm ones out of His mouth. Once we become lukewarm, we are not fitting for the Lord&#8217;s move and shall be vomited out of His mouth. When the recovered church becomes degraded, she is in danger, unless she repents to be hot in seeking the rich experiences of the Lord, of being vomited out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth. To be vomited out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth is to lose the enjoyment of all that the Lord is to His church.<h2 class=head3>3. Boasting That She Is Rich and Has Need of Nothing, Yet Not Knowing That She Is Wretched, Miserable, Poor, Blind, and Naked</h2><p>In verse 17 the Lord continues, &#8220;Because you say, I am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.&#8221; The degraded recovered church (&#8220;assembly&#8221;) boasts of her riches (mainly in the knowledge of doctrines). She does not realize that she is poor in life, blind in sight, and naked in conduct.<p>In the eyes of the Lord, the degraded assemblies are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked. They are wretched because they are proud of being rich in the vain knowledge of doctrines but are surely poor in the experience of the riches of Christ. They are miserable because they are naked, blind, and full of shame and darkness. They are also poor in the experience of Christ and in the spiritual reality of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. They care mainly for vain knowledge but scarcely care for the living experiences of Christ. This is real poverty, the poverty that makes the degraded recovered church wretched and miserable.<p>In the eyes of the Lord, the church in Laodicea is not only poor in the riches of Christ but also blind in genuine spiritual things. Although she has some amount of knowledge about spiritual things, she does not have true spiritual insight.<p>The Lord points out in verse 17 that the degraded recovered church is also naked. We Christians have all received Christ as our objective righteousness to cover us like a robe. This is for our justification before God. After being justified by Christ, we need to live by Christ and live out Christ so that He may be our subjective righteousness as another splendid robe to cover our daily walk. Because of the lack of the subjective experience of Christ, the degraded recovered church is naked in the eyes of the Lord.<h2 class=head3>4. Needing to Buy from the Lord</h2><p>In verse 18 the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see.&#8221; To buy requires the paying of a price. The degraded recovered church needs to pay a price for the gold, the white garments, and the eyesalve, which she desperately needs.<h2 class=head4>a. Refined Gold, the Proving of Faith for Partaking of the Divine Element of Christ, for Them to Be Fit for the Golden Lampstand</h2><p>First, the Lord counsels the church in Laodicea to buy &#8220;gold refined by fire.&#8221; In the Bible, our working faith (Gal. 5:6) is likened to gold (1 Pet. 1:7), and the divine nature, the nature of God, which is the divinity of Christ, is also typified by gold (Exo. 25:11). We partake of the nature of God by faith (2 Pet. 1:1, 4-5). The degraded recovered church has the knowledge of the doctrines concerning Christ but not much living faith to partake of the divine element of Christ. Hence, she needs to pay the price to gain the golden faith through the fiery trials that she may participate in the real gold, which is Christ Himself as the life element to His Body. In this way she may become a pure golden lampstand (Rev. 1:20) for the building of the golden New Jerusalem (21:18).<h2 class=head4>b. White Garments, Conduct Approvable to the Lord, Which Is the Lord Himself Lived Out of the Church, to Cover Her Nakedness</h2><p>Second, in 3:18 the Lord counsels the church in Laodicea to buy white garments that they may be clothed and that the shame of their nakedness may not be manifested. In figure, garments signify conduct. &#8220;White garments&#8221; here refer to conduct approvable to the Lord, which is the Lord Himself lived out of the church and which is required by the degraded recovered church to cover her nakedness.<h2 class=head4>c. Eyesalve, the Anointing Spirit Who Is Also the Lord Himself as the Life-giving Spirit, for Her Blindness</h2><p>Third, the Lord counsels the church in Laodicea to buy from Him eyesalve to anoint their eyes that they may see. The &#8220;eyesalve&#8221; needed to &#8220;anoint&#8221; their eyes must refer to the anointing Spirit (1 John 2:27), who is also the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Because the degraded recovered church has been distracted by the dead knowledge of letters, she needs this kind of eyesalve for her blindness.<h2 class=head3>5. Keeping the Lord outside Her Door</h2><p>In Revelation 3:20a the Lord says, &#8220;Behold, I stand at the door and knock.&#8221; The door here is not the door of individuals but the door of the church. The church in Laodicea has knowledge, but she does not have the presence of the Lord. The Lord, the Head of the church, is actually standing outside the degraded church, knocking at her door. This means that, in a very practical way, the degraded recovered church is Christless. This church has Christ in name but not in presence. In actuality, the Lord is outside her door.<h2 class=head3>6. The Lord&#8217;s Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</h2><p>In 3:20b and 21 we have the Lord&#8217;s promise to the overcomers of this stage. To overcome here means to overcome the lukewarmness and pride of the degraded recovered church, to buy the needed items, and to open the door for the Lord to come in.<h2 class=head4>a. To Have the Lord Come in to Them and Dine with Them and They with the Lord</h2><p>In verse 20b the Lord says, &#8220;If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me.&#8221; According to the Greek, the word &#8220;dine&#8221; signifies the principal meal of the day at evening. To dine is not merely to eat one item of food but to partake of the riches of a meal. This may imply the fulfillment of the type of the children of Israel eating the rich produce of the good land of Canaan (Josh. 5:10-12).<p>The dining promised in Revelation 3:20b is not only for the future but also for today. If we are overcomers, when the Lord comes in the kingdom we shall have the special privilege of eating with Him. Before that day, however, we may enjoy His dining with us.<h2 class=head4>b. To Be Given to Sit with the Lord on His Throne</h2><p>In verse 21 the Lord says, &#8220;He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.&#8221; To sit with the Lord on His throne will be a prize to the overcomer that he may participate in the Lord&#8217;s authority in the coming millennial kingdom. This means that the overcomers will be co-kings with Christ ruling over the whole earth.<h2 class=head2>I. All the Last Four Kinds of Churches Will Remain until the Lord&#8217;s Coming Back</h2><p>The seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 not only signify prophetically the progress of the church in seven stages but also symbolize the seven kinds of churches in church history: the initial church, the suffering church, the worldly church, the apostate church, the reformed church, the recovered church, and the degraded recovered church. The initial church had its continuation in the suffering church; the suffering church turned into the worldly church; and the worldly church became the apostate church. Hence, the first four churches eventually issued in one kind of church, that is, the apostate church, the Roman Catholic Church. Then, as a reaction to the apostate church, the reformed church came into existence as another kind of church, a church not fully recovered. Following this, the recovered church was raised up as a full recovery of the church life. By the degradation of the recovered church, the degraded recovered church came into being. These four kinds of churches-the Roman Catholic Church, the reformed church, the recovered church, and the degraded recovered church-will remain until the Lord comes back. Undoubtedly, only the recovered church can fulfill God&#8217;s eternal purpose, and only she is what the Lord is after.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE CONSUMMATION OF THE CHURCH</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the consummation of the church.<h2 class=head1>XVI. THE CONSUMMATION OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>The consummation of the church will be the New Jerusalem. Today the church is a miniature of the New Jerusalem. The proper church life in its genuineness is a small model of the New Jerusalem. The crucial matter here, however, is that the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of all of God&#8217;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, perfected, and glorified people.<p>The New Jerusalem will be the totality of God&#8217;s work in both the old creation and in the new creation. First, God created the old creation. Although the old creation became fallen, God was prepared to deal with that situation. He came to be a man, a God-man, a man with divinity mingled with humanity, to accomplish redemption. This God-man could redeem sinners, dying for them, because He had the blood to shed for them. This blood is called &#8220;His own blood&#8221; (Acts 20:28) and &#8220;the blood of Jesus His Son&#8221; (1 John 1:7). Through His all-inclusive death, the Lord released His resurrection life, and with this life He produced, sanctified, transformed, built, and glorified the people whom He had predestinated. The totality of this work, its ultimate consummation, will be the New Jerusalem. Instead of being a material city, the New Jerusalem is a symbol of the totality of God&#8217;s work.<h2 class=head2>A. All the Members of the Church Are Produced in the Church Age</h2><p>All the members of the church are produced in the church age, that is, in the age between Christ&#8217;s first coming and His coming back. The members of the church are those who were fallen sinners and who have been saved by the grace of God (Eph. 2:8) through their God-given and God-allotted faith (2 Pet. 1:1), which has brought them into an organic union with the Triune God in Christ (1 Cor. 6:17). These members of the church have been forgiven of their sins (Acts 10:43). They have been justified by God in Christ (Acts 13:39; 1 Cor. 6:11), and they have been reconciled to God (Rom. 5:10), so they have been redeemed back to God (Rev. 5:9). Based upon this, the members of the church have been regenerated in their spirit by the Spirit of God (John 3:6) to be the children of God unto the divine sonship (John 1:12-13; Rom. 8:16) and to be the members of Christ (Eph. 5:30) unto His stature (Eph. 4:13) to be His fullness (Eph. 1:23).<h2 class=head2>B. The New Testament Overcomers Are Also Perfected in the Church Age</h2><p>The New Testament overcomers are not only produced in the church age but are also perfected in the church age. The perfecting of the New Testament overcomers is a matter of transformation through the subjective experience and enjoyment of Christ. Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &#8220;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; To be transformed is to have Christ added into our being to replace what we are so that Christ may increase and our natural life may decrease. As the process of transformation takes place within us, the old element of our natural being is carried away, and the glory, the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, is added into us to replace the natural element. It is through such a process that the New Testament overcomers are perfected in this age.<h2 class=head2>C. The Immature Believers Will Be Perfected in the Age of the Millennium</h2><p>The need for transformation is neglected by many Christians today. As a result, many have been kept from being transformed and perfected by the genuine experience and enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ with His unsearchable riches. As a result, there is no way for God to perfect these immature believers in the church age. However, because they are God&#8217;s chosen, redeemed, called, and regenerated people, God will not let them go. Rather, He will perfect them in the coming age of the millennium.<h2 class=head3>1. Through the Lord&#8217;s Dispensational and Governmental Discipline</h2><p>The perfecting of the immature believers in the age of the millennium will be through the Lord&#8217;s dispensational and governmental discipline. Hebrews 12:6 tells us, &#8220;Whom the Lord loves He disciplines and scourges every son whom He receives.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s discipline of the believers is not only in this age but also in the coming age. Because the age of the millennium will still belong to the old heaven and the old earth, the coming age will still be a time for the Father to deal with His children so that they may be perfected. Those believers who are not perfected in the church age will be perfected in the age of the millennium. The means of their perfection will be the Lord&#8217;s dispensational and governmental discipline. This discipline will be for those who were slothful in the church age, in the dispensation of grace, and did not apply the Lord&#8217;s sufficient grace and enjoy it, taking this grace as their portion. Such believers will need the Lord&#8217;s loving discipline in the coming age for their perfection.<h2 class=head3>2. As Illustrated by the Cases of the Unfaithful Slave and the Slothful Slave in Matthew 24:48-51 and 25:24-30</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s dispensational and governmental discipline of the immature believers in the age of the millennium is illustrated by the cases of the unfaithful slave and the slothful slave in Matthew 24:48-51 and 25:24-30. Matthew 24:48 and 49 speak of an evil slave who says in his heart, &#8220;My master is delaying his coming,&#8221; and who begins to &#8220;beat his fellow slaves, and eat and drink with the drunken.&#8221; Verses 50 and 51 say, &#8220;The master of that slave shall come on a day when he does not expect him, and in an hour which he does not know, and shall cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.&#8221; The problem with the evil slave is not that he does not know that the Lord is coming but that he does not expect Him. He does not like to live the kind of life that is prepared for the Lord&#8217;s coming. Moreover, the evil slave beats his fellow slaves, that is, mistreats the fellow believers, and eats and drinks with the drunken, that is, keeps company with worldly people, who are drunk with worldly things. Therefore, when the Lord comes back, He will cut asunder the evil slave and appoint his portion with the hypocrites.<p>To &#8220;cut him asunder&#8221; means to cut him off, not to cut him to pieces. This signifies a separation from the Lord in His coming glory. The Lord will not cut the evil slave in pieces; rather, He will cast him off from the glory in which He Himself will be. The issue here is not salvation but the discipline of an immature believer in the coming age. Such a believer will miss the enjoyment of the kingdom and instead suffer punishment and discipline where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<p>For a believer to be cut asunder is for him to be cut asunder from the organic union with the Lord. Whenever a person believes in the Lord, he is put into an organic union with the Triune God so that he may enjoy Him. According to Matthew 28:19, the believers are to be baptized into the name of the Triune God, that is, into an organic union with the Triune God, so that they may participate in Him, partake of Him, and enjoy Him. By enjoying the Triune God in the organic union we are transformed and perfected, made ready for the Lord to come back to take us into His enjoyment in the millennium. However, Matthew 24 tells us clearly that in the coming age certain ones will be cut asunder from the organic union. This means that they will be cut off from the enjoyment of the Lord. This cutting off from the organic union corresponds to the taking away of the branches in John 15. For a branch to be cut off from the vine means that it is cut off from the union with the vine. Those branches that are in union with the vine enjoy and participate in all the riches of the vine, but those branches that are cut off from the vine lose this enjoyment. This is the correct understanding of the cutting asunder in Matthew 24.<p>After the immature believers have been cut asunder, cut off from the organic union with the Lord, they will be put into the outer darkness, the darkness outside the bright glory in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. This is different from being cast into the lake of fire after the millennium for eternity (Rev. 20:15). The overcomers will be called into the Lord&#8217;s enjoyment, which will be in the glory, but the defeated ones will be put outside this glory. They will be outside the glory in which the Lord and His overcomers will be during the coming age. To be in the glory will be a reward, but to be put outside the glory will be a kind of punishment. Those who are put into the outer darkness will weep and gnash their teeth. The weeping will indicate regret, and the gnashing of teeth, self-blame. Both the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be a sign of suffering the Lord&#8217;s dispensational and governmental discipline.<p>The Lord&#8217;s dispensational and governmental discipline is also illustrated by the case of the slothful slave in Matthew 25:24-30. In verses 26 through 30 we see that the one-talented one who was not faithful in using his gift is rebuked by the Lord and punished. Verse 30 says, &#8220;Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.&#8221; Whoever is cast into outer darkness will be cut off from the Lord, from His presence, from His fellowship, and from the glorious sphere in which the Lord will be. This is not to perish eternally but to be chastened dispensationally during the coming age of the kingdom. This chastening, this punishment, has a goal, and this goal is the believers&#8217; perfection.<p>In this dispensation of grace, the Lord is supporting us and supplying us with rich grace so that we may enjoy this grace, be edified, and be transformed for our perfection. If we are faithful, we shall enter into His joy in the coming age. But if we are not faithful, we shall be disciplined by Him in the coming age so that we may be perfected. Those who are faithful in this age of grace will be rewarded by the Lord in the coming age. They will be with Him in glory and even reign with Him. But for those who are not perfected in the church age, the age of the millennium will be a time of discipline. In order to be fitting to enter into the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth, the immature believers will need to be perfected through discipline during the coming age.<h2 class=head2>D. All the Regenerated and Perfected Believers of the New Testament as Members of the Church, Represented by the Twelve Apostles, Will Be the Components of the New Jerusalem, Which Is the Church&#8217;s Ultimate Consummation</h2><p>God&#8217;s intention is that the church will consummate in the New Jerusalem. All the regenerated and perfected believers as members of the church, represented by the twelve apostles (Rev. 21:14), will be the components of the New Jerusalem. After the dispensation of grace, there will be the dispensation of the kingdom. During this dispensation, all the perfected ones, including the overcomers of the Old Testament and the overcomers of the New Testament, will be the totality of overcomers to be the New Jerusalem. They will be the New Jerusalem in its first stage, the stage of the millennium. During this stage, the New Jerusalem will be Christ&#8217;s bride. Also during the millennium, the defeated, slothful, immature believers will be perfected through their suffering of the Lord&#8217;s dispensational and governmental discipline. Therefore, after the millennium, they also will be components of the New Jerusalem in the second stage, that is, in the new heaven and the new earth. In this second stage the New Jerusalem will be enlarged to be the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21. This enlarged New Jerusalem will be the consummation of the church. From this we can see that the ultimate consummation of the church life will be the New Jerusalem, first in a smaller scale in the millennium composed only of the overcomers and then in an enlarged scale in the new heaven and the new earth composed of all the believers of the New Testament.<h2 class=head3>1. Consummated in Enjoying the Eternal and Divine Life of the Processed and Consummated Triune God</h2><p>The proper church life today is the enjoyment of the eternal and divine life of the processed and consummated Triune God. This enjoyment is just a foretaste; the full taste will be in New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth, which will be the consummation of our enjoyment of our processed and consummated Triune God in its fullest without limitation for eternity.<h2 class=head3>2. Consummated in Experiencing the Mingling of Humanity with Divinity in the Dispensing of the Unsearchable Riches of the Processed and Consummated Divine Trinity</h2><p>Our Christian life today is the experience of the mingling of divinity with humanity in the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of the processed and consummated divine Trinity. This is also a foretaste, and its full taste as its consummation will be also in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth eternally.<h2 class=head3>3. Consummated in Expressing the Processed and Consummated Triune God in His Ultimate Manifestation for Eternity</h2><p>Both our Christian life and church life are the expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in His ultimate manifestation for eternity. Today this is just in the initial stage. Its consummation will be also in the New Jerusalem as the ultimate manifestation of the processed and consummated Triune God for eternity.<p>The church today should grow and be built up in the three matters of enjoying the eternal and divine life of the processed and consummated Triune God, of experiencing the mingling of humanity with divinity in the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of the processed and consummated divine Trinity, and of expressing the processed and consummated Triune God in His ultimate manifestation. This means that the church must grow and be built up in the enjoyment of the eternal, divine life, the life of the processed and consummated Triune God; that the church must grow and be built up in experiencing the mingling of the believers with the Triune God in the way of His dispensing of the unsearchable riches of the processed and consummated divine Trinity; and that the church must grow and be built up in the expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in His manifestation. This is the church life.<p>In some of the foregoing messages we covered the various aspects of the status of the church: the assembly, the house of God, the kingdom of God, the Body of Christ, the counterpart of Christ, the new man, and the golden lampstands. Now we need to see that all these matters can be realized by us in the local churches only as we enjoy the life of the processed and consummated Triune God, experience the mingling of humanity with divinity in the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of the processed and consummated divine Trinity, and express the processed and consummated Triune God in His manifestation.</body></html>
