<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING THE CENTER AND<br />
THE CONTENT OF THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING EVERYTHING</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that Christ is the center and the content of the Word of God. In this chapter we will use twelve points to show that as the center and the content of the Word of God, Christ is everything.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Both God and Man</h2>
<p>God and man are the positive items in the universe. Christ is both God and man. We cannot know God unless we know Christ, and we cannot see a proper man unless we see Christ. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God.&rdquo; This verse speaks of Christ as the Word and as God. Romans 9:5 speaks of &ldquo;Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever,&rdquo; and 1 Timothy 2:5 says, &ldquo;The man Christ Jesus.&rdquo; These verses show that Christ is both God and man. The Lord Jesus is the eternal God. At a certain point in time, He, the eternal God, became flesh; that is, God entered into man (John 1:14). This person was both God and man. He then passed through death and resurrection and ascended into heaven. To this day, He is still a man in heaven. When Stephen was martyred, &ldquo;he looked intently into heaven and saw...Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God&rdquo; (Acts 7:55-56). According to 1 Timothy 3:16, God was manifested in the flesh. The word <em>flesh</em> refers to man. Hence, God&rsquo;s being manifested in the flesh is His being manifested in the man Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is God yet man, and He is man yet God. In Him God and man are joined together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Father and the Son</h2>
<p>Christ is both God the Father and God the Son (John 14:9-10). The Father and the Son are not two separate persons. The Father is the source of the Son, and the Son is the expression of the Father. God hidden is the Father, and God expressed is the Son (1 Tim. 6:16; John 1:18); the two are in fact one. With human beings, a father and a son are two persons, but with Christ, He is both the Father and the Son. Therefore, He said that He and the Father are one (10:30). Isaiah 9:6 says that the Son who has been given to us is called the Eternal Father. The Son is the Eternal Father. This is exceedingly mysterious. It is incomprehensible and inexplicable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Image of God and<br />
Having the Likeness of Man</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ &ldquo;is the image of the invisible God.&rdquo; This means that when we see Christ, we see God. Apart from Christ we cannot know or even see God. Philippians 2:6-7 says, &ldquo;Who, existing in the form of God...emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men.&rdquo; This means that Christ also has the likeness of man. In Christ we see the condition of a normal man. In order to know Christ, we must see Him as the image of God and as the image of man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Both the Creator and a Creature</h2>
<p>Christ is both the Creator and a creature. Colossians 1:15-16 says that He is &ldquo;the Firstborn of all creation, because in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.&rdquo; Verse 16 says that Christ is the Creator, but verse 15 says that He is the Firstborn of all creation; that is, He is the first in creation, the first of all creatures. To become flesh is to become a man, and man is a creature. We cannot comprehend how Christ is not only a creature but also the Firstborn of all creation. He is the first creature. He existed first, and then God created man according to His image and likeness. This truth has caused many theological disputes. It is beyond what the human mind can comprehend, but we must accept Christ as both the Creator and a creature, according to the explicit words of the Bible.</p>
<p>If God were not for our enjoyment, there would not be a need for Him to be incarnated. God is in Christ. In order to be our enjoyment, that is, to have a relationship with us, His creatures, God was incarnated to be a man. He took the position of a creature. Hence, He is no longer only the Creator but also a creature. The person of Christ is very complicated. By Himself God is only the Creator; He is not a creature. However, when God was incarnated, He was still the Creator, but He became a creature. God in Christ has all the details related to being a creature as well as being the Firstborn of all creation.</p>
