<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TO BE SAVED<br>IN THE DIVINE LIFE OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10; 8:2, 6b, 4; 12:2a; 6:19b, 22b; 12:2b; Col. 3:4; Rom. 12:1, 3-5; 8:29b, 6, 11, 30c; Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:23; 5:17; 16:20</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY OF LIFE IN THE BOOK OF ROMANS</H2><P>In this message we will see the matter of the Triune God being life to the tripartite man as shown in the book of Romans. In other words, we will see the book of Romans in the way of life. The verses listed at the beginning of this message are concerning the divine life in the book of Romans. We need a complete view of the book of Romans.</P><P>The title of this message is "To Be Saved in the Divine Life of Christ." As we come to this subject, we need to keep in mind the preceding messages, especially message five which was entitled "The Triune God Being Processed to Be the Life-giving Spirit and the Tripartite Man Being Created with a Spirit to Be the Receiver and Container of the Divine Life." In this and other messages, we have seen how the thought of God being man's life runs throughout the divine revelation, from Genesis to Revelation. We have also seen that the Triune God has been processed to be the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Then we have seen how the tripartite man has been created with a spirit (Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27) to be the receiver and container of the divine life. God was processed to be a Spirit, and we were created with a spirit. When these two spirits come together, we have life. In the foregoing messages, we have seen many things in a general way. But with this message, we will begin to study these things in more detail, point by point.</P><P>The first point of our more detailed study is the Triune God being life to us as revealed in the book of Romans. Most Bible expositors do not touch the matter of life in the book of Romans. Most of them mainly touch the matter of righteousness. This is because of the importance of Romans 1:17 which says, "For the righteousness of God is revealed in it [the gospel] out of faith to faith: as it is written, But the just shall have life and live by faith" (lit.). Most of the expositors only cover the first part of this verse, but neglect the end of it which deals with having life and living by faith.</P><P>There are three crucial points in Romans 1:17: righteousness, faith, and life. The righteousness of God is unveiled out of faith to faith in order that the righteous or just can have life and live by faith. According to my study I have found that other Christian writers usually stress the matters of righteousness and faith in Romans, but not the matter of life. The reason for this is that they, as indicated by their theology, have not yet arrived at the matter of life.</P>
