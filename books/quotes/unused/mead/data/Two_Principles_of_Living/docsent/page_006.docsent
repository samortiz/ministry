   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THERE SHOULD BE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FULLNESS OF LIFE WITHIN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes we come across a brother who has acted very foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to what is proper, we should strongly exhort or rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We tell ourselves that he requires a serious, thorough dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We prepare ourselves to face the situation because we know he will be around for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We go to his home and knock on the door, but then we ask ourselves whether we are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He acted foolishly, so what can we do but exhort him?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have gone to his door and raised our hand to knock, but inwardly there is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our raised hand drops to our side.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though we have convinced ourselves that we are right, this is not a matter of right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a matter of whether or not the life of God allows us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times when we go to exhort a brother, he will receive our exhortation with courtesy and promise to do what God says.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet the more we preach to him, the more our inward being wilts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we return home, we have to admit that we have been wrong in exhorting the brother!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, it is not a matter of good or bad but a matter of being full of life inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I will give you another example.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I met a needy brother a few days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was extremely poor and needed some help.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I thought that I certainly should do something for him because there was no prospect of help coming to him from any direction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Just at that point I had no surplus, so it was a great sacrifice to come to his aid.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I seemed to be exceeding the limits of my strength to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to what is proper, I was right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I should have been happy as I gave him some money.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet for some unknown reason, I wilted inwardly as I gave him the money which I had promised to give him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A voice within said, "You are just acting on charity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That was not an act of life; it was merely human chivalry and natural kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was not done in life but in yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God did not want me to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have suffered concerning that matter for two or three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though I had given the brother money, I had to bow before God, confess my sin, and ask His forgiveness when I reached home.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>OUR LIVING AND ACTIONS MUST BE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>ACCORDING TO THE LEADING OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers and sisters, as we live before God, our actions must not be determined by good and evil, but by the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever life wants us to do is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Anything that we do without life, no matter how good it may be, will bring us nothing but inward condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A Christian should not only repent before God for the sins he has committed; often, he must repent before God for the good things he has done.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The principle of our living is not one that differentiates between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must come before God to determine what is of life and what is of death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we have life within and feel life rising up, we are doing the proper thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the life does not rise up and we cannot sense the anointing in our being, we should not care whether we are acting according to right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, we must confess before God and ask His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul said that he judged nothing by himself, but that only God judged him 1 Cor 4:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people do not understand this passage in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This sentence is very simple, but if we do not know life, it is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have an outward standard of good and evil, it is very easy to judge when we are wrong and right.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul did not act according to an outward standard of right and wrong, so he could only say, "I do not even examine myself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified in this, but He who examines me is the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The one who examines us before the judgment seat is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In addition, we have a life within us that leads us on.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That is the reason 2 Corinthians 5:7 says, "We walk by faith, not by appearance."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not determine things by an outward, visible law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We live according to the leading which the Lord gives us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must learn the lesson before God that we should never act merely according to the standard of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The standard of right and wrong is not bad; it is a good standard, but it is not good enough for a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Christian's standard surpasses right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The things which are wrong are wrong, but the things which are right are not always right.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we act according to God's life, He will show us that His demands are higher than those of human law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This being the case, it becomes very easy to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In every matter when we seek God's speaking within us, spontaneously there will be the shining of inward light.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Please remember that our regeneration is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is also a fact that God is living in us through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord is constantly expressing Himself within us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We hope that each of us would be able to say to God, "Grace me so that I live by the tree of life, not by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I want to constantly pay attention to life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I want to ask, What is the sense of life?'"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we live by this principle, we will see a great change in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many problems arise because we only have a standard of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many mistakes are made because we do not have the standard of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we have the standard of life, many problems will be resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>O Lord, we stand before You beseeching You to speak again.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Man is empty and cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can only ask for Your grace to open our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every time we open our mouths or make decisions, cause us to come before You and ask if our decision is according to right and wrong or according to the inward leading of life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Lord, cause us to see the difference between what is spiritual and what is fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Cause us to really see the difference between inward light and outward law.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Lord, save us from the way of death.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Lord, it is wrong for us to live by discerning right from wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>May we see that discerning right from wrong is sin and death, because only those who live in death can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Those who live in life must be led by life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It must be the life that takes the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Lord, be among us so that we would see this clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have said this many times, and we want to say it again: May Your Word not be spoken in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Cause us to know what life is and what law is.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Bless these scattered utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Have mercy on us, and grace us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Lead us in the way before us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Amen.</S>
