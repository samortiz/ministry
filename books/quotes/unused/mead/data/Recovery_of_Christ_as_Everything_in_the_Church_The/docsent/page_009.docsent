   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ said, I am the way and the reality and the life John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the two preceding chapters we saw how Christ becomes life and reality to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we come to Christ being the way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ first becomes life to us, then reality, and lastly the way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must have Christ as our life in order to participate in Him as our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we have Him as our reality, this reality becomes our way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The way to live the Christian life is a person, the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is our way to contact and serve God, fellowship with other believers, live the church life, preach the gospel, and shepherd the saints.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1:22 through 24 he says, Indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the previous chapter we saw that Christ becomes the reality of all things to us by being the power and the wisdom of God.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The crucified Christ is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 2:1 through 4 Paul says, I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling; and my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul spoke not from his eloquence, keen mind, or burning emotion but from his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His natural being, including his mind and emotion, was crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Paul preached only Christ crucified, he had the attitude of one who was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was with the saints not in his mind but in weakness, fear, and much trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His speech was in demonstration of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul s example shows the crucified Christ as the way to minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way to preach the word is not an exalted way but a crucified way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To rely on human capacity, eloquence, or charisma is to not take the crucified way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The proper way to preach the gospel and minister life to people is the crucified way the way that puts us to death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This way is a person the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The crucified Christ is not only the way to preach the word but also the way to live.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to live, we must die.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way to live is to die.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not know how to die, we do not know how to live.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When young saints ask me how to help others, I say, The way to help others is to die.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some young husbands have asked me how they can properly love their wives.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way to love our spouse is the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A number of times young wives have asked me how to submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They feel that they are able to submit to the Lord and to the church, but it is very difficult for them to submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I tell them, You have to die.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The way is to die.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To live is easy; to die is hard.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even the Lord Jesus, who was holy, pure, sinless, and perfect, had to die and be buried before touching God s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John the Baptist thought that only the sinners needed to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to his natural concept, because Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit and was therefore holy, sinless, and perfect, He did not need to be buried but could enter directly into God s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the Lord Jesus knew that no person should touch God s ministry without having his human nature buried.</S>
