<P>Anointing is like painting. In painting, one layer of paint is painted upon another until the painted article is covered with all the elements of the paint. This is the dispensing of the paint into the painted article. Today, the Triune God as a compound Spirit is painting Himself into us. As such a compound Spirit, He is the consummation, or completion, of the Triune God. In eternity past God was perfect, but He was not complete. He needed humanity, the wonderful death, and the powerful resurrection to make Himself complete. By passing through all the processes, God is now not only perfect but also complete. This completion is the consummation of the Triune God.</P><P>Today, our consummated, processed Triune God is the very compound Spirit. The very Christ in whom we believe today is a life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the compound Spirit, and the compound Spirit is the completed, consummated God, the consummation of the processed Triune God. This is our Christ and our Savior. When we speak to others about Christ, we do not have to talk so much. As long as people believe in Him and call on His name, the compound ointment as a "paint" will anoint them. This will give them one coat of paint. However, this coat may not be very thick. We need to go back to them and sing, pray, read the Word, and call on the Lord with them again. This will give them some thicker coats of paint. Day by day and moment by moment, as they are under this anointing, they will experience the "painting," layer upon layer and coat upon coat.</P><P>As such a compound Spirit, Christ became the bountiful supply of the Divine Trinity for His dispensing. Philippians 1:19 uses the term the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit today is no longer merely the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God has been compounded with the elements of Christ's humanity, death, and resurrection to become the Spirit of Jesus Christ. As such a compound Spirit, He has the bountiful supply.</P><P>Today the Pentecostal people seek to be filled with the Spirit. But many of them do not realize that to be filled with the Spirit is to be filled with the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. To be filled with the Spirit is to be filled with the compound Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who is the bountiful supply. To have the bountiful supply is to be supplied with whatever we need. In Greek, the word for bountiful supply denotes the supplying of all the needs of a musical group by the leader of the group. Whatever the group needs, whether it be musical instruments, clothing, uniforms, food, or medicine, is supplied by the leader.</P><P>Today, Christ is such a Leader. As the life-giving Spirit, who is the compound Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, He has the bountiful supply to meet all our needs. Paul was able to do such a marvelous work for Christ because within him there was such a bountiful supply. This bountiful supply comes from the source of the consummation of the processed Triune God. This consummation is the compound Spirit, and this compound Spirit is Jesus Christ.</P><P>We should not say that we are weak. Instead, we should be strengthened and encouraged because the very Spirit within us is the compound Spirit. We can go out to preach the gospel by being supplied with Him. When we knock on others' doors, we should do so by exercising our spirit and our faith, with much assurance. We should not go according to our feeling, but according to the revelation of the Bible. If we go in this way, our way of preaching the gospel will be transformed. The old way is to speak to people without power, but the new way is to speak with Christ in us. The new way is not merely to knock on the doors of people's houses; it is to knock on the door of their heart and to touch their spirit. To do this we must speak with faith and assurance. The Lord Jesus told the disciples that He had received all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). Therefore, we can go with Him as our authority. When we speak to people with this Christ, who is God passing through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to be the compound Spirit with the bountiful supply, our preaching will become very different from what it was in the past.</P><P>Some people do not believe that a person can be saved within a short time. But painting does not take a long time. If someone comes to you with a can of paint, he can put the paint on you without saying too many words. There is no need to speak too much. Some have been in the church for many years. They may know many things, but they may not have the faith, the power, the authority, or the bountiful supply. The old way is to beseech people in a weak way, but the new way is to go to people with Christ in us.</P><P>It is not a small thing to have Christ within us. As the Spirit within us, He has passed through the great processes of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Now, as the compounded One, He is within us. We have Him, and we are one with Him; therefore, we have the assurance. We should not merely preach to others; we should give them with assurance the command and the order to believe and be baptized.</P>
