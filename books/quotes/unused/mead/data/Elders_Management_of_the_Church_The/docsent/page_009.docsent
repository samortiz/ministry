   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that God has His government in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to see that there is government also in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Testament revelation shows us that the government of the church is very simple and practical: All the government of a church is entrusted to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The elders are the government of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to their spiritual stature, the elders are those who are mature and older.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the affairs they handle, they are the overseers, which speaks of government and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times, we consider the elders to be the leading ones, the shepherds, and those who take care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Seldom do we consider them to be the ones responsible for government.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please remember that shepherding, exercising care, and leading are all for government.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible has not called the elders teachers or shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although 1 Peter says that the elders should shepherd the flock, it does not call them shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the Bible clearly calls the elders overseers Phil 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Teacher is not a title ascribed to the elders, nor is shepherd a title ascribed to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only overseer is a title ascribed to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason for this is that the elders are those responsible for government and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God set up elders in the church in order that they would manage and govern the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would like the brothers and sisters to know that if the elders are truly managing and governing the church, the church will surely be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the elders only shepherd and teach without managing, or if they are incapable of managing, the church will be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even if it is strong and living for a while, the situation is not reliable and will not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order for a local church to be strong, living, reliable, and stable, the elders must be able to govern and administer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps the brothers would ask where in the Bible can we find the elders managing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the New Testament, not only do we have examples, but we have the definite teaching as well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Corinthians talks about the matter of excommunication.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a matter of administration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Timothy chapter three says clearly that the elders are those who take care of, or manage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Corinthians chapter twelve says that God appoints in the church apostles, prophets, and other kinds of people, including one kind that is for administration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Romans chapter twelve says that those who lead should do so in diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The management and administration here speak of government.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In a locality where saints begin to meet, under normal circumstances, elders should be set up as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the example of Acts chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not long after Paul had preached in Asia, he appointed elders in those churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without the elders, there will be no government in the church, and there will be no administration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church will then be in confusion and will not be strong.</S>
