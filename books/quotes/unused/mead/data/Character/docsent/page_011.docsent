   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LAZINESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many in the Lord s service have a big problem in their character laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have several points to cover concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is by no means a great doctrine, yet it has much to do with our usefulness to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first characteristic of one who serves the Lord must be diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A lazy person is useless to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Can you find a verse in the Bible which tells us that God spoke to Moses in the evening?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the contrary, in a number of instances God called Moses early and told him to go in the morning to a certain place to meet Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Dear brothers and sisters, a slothful person can never be useful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Diligence must be built into our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not wish to find fault with you, but I feel that I have a responsibility before the Lord to say this to you: some of you impress me as being lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are many proofs of this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Forgive me for telling you that you are lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>O brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>O sisters!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Allow me the liberty to say this, and believe what I say.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was once your age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have also passed through what you are now learning and pursuing regarding the Lord s service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am clear by watching you from the sidelines.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I realize that you are not intentionally lazy but are so because there is not the element of diligence in your character.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because your past living, circumstances, and habits did not help to build diligence into your character, you now are short of it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At this point I must ask all of you, even the Chinese people, to forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, our country is not strong enough, not what it should be.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are making progress too slowly in politics, the economy, social condition, and education.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather than criticizing the leaders of the government, we must put the blame on our national character.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to realize that the Chinese have a poor character.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are irresponsible, frivolous, and lazy; we pass the buck.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With this kind of character, how can we succeed in building up a nation?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that our country would be strong if all those of average education were diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My point is that since we Chinese are born in such a situation, when we serve God, we encounter many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we have been raised in such an environment, if we are not completely revolutionized within, and if we bring our national character into the Lord s service, our service will never be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such is an improper character.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How deeply I am grieved concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our present condition, we would probably make a great work small and a small work disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This has everything to do with our character.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>NOT BEING EARNEST</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another common condition is that most of you do not do things earnestly; you lack aggressiveness and simply try to get by.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You always begin something without finishing it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Your belongings are disorderly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And when you say that you are short of time, it is because you are loose and waste time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If this is how you brothers and sisters do things, could your Bible study be any different?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you do things sloppily, how can you be careful in your Bible study?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Your character will be the same in everything you do.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have often criticized the way you dress.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not refer to the quality of your clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I realize from the way you dress that there is a shortage in your character.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Your carelessness and sloppiness are seen in the way you dress.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are careless in dressing, could you be fine in Bible study?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Could you do your work well?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Could your work be prevailing, and could it produce valuable results?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not believe so.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What you do always reflects your character.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I say again, unless this character is replaced and a new one built up, you will be useless in God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>O brothers, you must exercise yourself in these daily matters to build up something in yourself so that the divine fire can burn upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not think that I am stressing outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Also, do not assume that to emphasize character is unspiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are you genuinely spiritual with such a faulty character?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brothers and sisters, I say again, you must build up a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Unless this is built up in you, your usefulness to the Lord will be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope that from now on especially the young people will begin to build up a character that is useful to the Lord, so that every aspect of their living will be fit for the Lord s use.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord Jesus said that one who is faithful in the least will be faithful in much Luke 16:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If your dress, your home, and the things you do reveal that you are a careless and passive person, how can your service to the Lord be aggressive?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is hardly possible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you have not built up a proper character, you can give only an ordinary message, not a prevailing one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Your prayers also will be ordinary, not prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They will be the same today as they were two years ago, showing no progress at all.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Brothers, we must improve our character; otherwise, we will accomplish nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even if we receive grace, we will not be able to minister that grace in spirit, because we are simply not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I realize that my speaking has been somewhat fragmented, but I hope that from now on you will seize every occasion, large and small, to build up your character so that you will be suitable for God s use.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because of your character, you do not receive any great light in reading the Bible, as others do.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You would merely gloss over chapter one of the Gospel of Matthew, which speaks of Christ s genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Why did Matthew speak of Christ s genealogy, whereas John did not?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A person with a seeking character will definitely ask questions when he comes to this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I cannot speak too much in detail; I can only lay down a principle here.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Just remember, our usefulness to God will be manifested only when we have a character suitable for His use.</S>
