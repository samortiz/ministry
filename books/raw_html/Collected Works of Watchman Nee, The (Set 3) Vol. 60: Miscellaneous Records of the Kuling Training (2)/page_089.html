<h2 class="head3">Believers Not Being Perfected<br />by the Law after They Are Saved</h2><p>Some ask, "It is true that we are saved by Christ and not by the law. But after we are saved, should we not keep the law?" We have to study Galatians because it deals exclusively with this question. Before many people believed in the Lord, they mistakenly thought that they could be justified by the law. After they believe in the Lord, they still think that they should keep the law. Paul said that it is useless for a man to keep the law before he is justified. After he is justified, it is equally useless for him to keep the law. Paul wanted to show the Galatians that they were still unable to keep what they once could not keep. Let us see how Paul dealt with those who insisted that believers should keep the law. Some told the Galatians that they should keep the law after they were saved. In 1:6 Paul said, "I marvel that you are so quickly removing from Him who has called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel." Verse 7 continues, "Which is not another gospel, only there are some who trouble you and desire to pervert the gospel of Christ." These ones made the gospel of Christ no longer a gospel. In verse 8 Paul spoke a strong word: "If even we or an angel out of heaven should announce to you a gospel beyond that which we have announced to you, let him be accursed." Then verse 9 says, "If anyone announces to you a gospel beyond that which you have received, let him be accursed." Paul said that those who were distracting the Galatians should be accursed. In 2:18 Paul said, "For if I build again the things which I have destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor." Paul said that those who preached another gospel should be accursed. He also said that if he were to build again the things which he had destroyed, that is, if he were to ask a saved person to keep the law again, he would prove himself to be a transgressor. Christ died to the law in order that we could live to Christ. Verse 20 says, "I am crucified with Christ." Since I am crucified with Christ, putting me under the law again would be unlawful. Although I am a living person, I am crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. We who live to Christ can no longer be placed under the law. The law only speaks to the natural man; it cannot speak to a dead man.</p><p>In verses 3:1 and 3 Paul spoke to the Galatians: "O foolish Galatians...are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?" Paul was saying that the law only addresses those who are in the flesh. Galatians 5:22 and 23 say that there is no law against the fruit of the Spirit. This means that the fruit of the Spirit is not under the control of the law. Since it is not under the control of the law, the same Holy Spirit in us would never lead us to keep the law. The law is only meant for those in the flesh. Those who break the law are in the flesh, and those who keep the law are also in the flesh. Once the law comes, the flesh becomes active, and the Holy Spirit is stifled because the flesh wars with the Spirit. Once a man tries to keep the law, the flesh is activated. If a man does not try to keep the law, the flesh will not move. The target of the law is the flesh. Galatians 3 clearly shows that we cannot be justified by the law. Since we have begun by the Spirit, we cannot go back to the law. Today many Christians still carry the flavor of Judaism. We have to be on the alert. Not only are there Judaizers in the church, we may become a Judaizer ourselves if we are not careful. Some do not understand God's plan and arrangement in His redemption; they only pay attention to the things of the law and thus make themselves Judaizers.</p><p>Since a Christian does not need to keep the law, does this mean that he can break the law? Please notice that God's intention for giving man the law was not for man to keep it. God never says that those who keep the law will satisfy His heart. God did not give man the law with the intention that he would keep it, but with the intention that he would gain the righteousness of the law. We have to differentiate between the law and the righteousness of the law. Not being covetous, honoring one's parents, and refraining from idolatry&mdash;these are the righteousnesses of the law. God does not want man to keep the law but to gain the righteousness of the law. In summary, God's intention in instituting the law is as follows: First, He apparently wants man to keep the law, but only for the purpose of exposing him so that he would see the futility of his flesh. Second, He wants man to inherit the righteousness of the law. Third, He wants man to have His life. In order to have life, a man cannot be lawless. Without the righteousness of the law, he cannot receive life. When man inherits Christ as his righteousness, he inherits life as well. According to the law, a man receives the righteousness of the law and inherits life if he keeps the law (Lev. 18:5). Today we can inherit the righteousness of the law and have life without keeping the law. As long as we believe in the Lord, we become righteous (Gal. 2:16), and we have life. But after we have inherited life, the Judaizers say that we should keep the law in order to gain the righteousness of the law. This is wrong. Once a man tries to keep the law, the old man is revived. We are saved when God puts us into the death of Christ. We inherit righteousness through the blood of the Lord, and we receive life by inheriting righteousness. This life is not under the law. If we want to keep the law, our flesh will have to keep it. When we try to keep the law, the flesh is revived. The new life the Lord has given us is not under the law; rather, it fulfills the righteousness of law automatically within us.</p>
