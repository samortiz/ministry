<h1 class="title">PRACTICING THE GENUINE CHURCH LIFE<br />
BY LIVING AND WALKING<br />
BY THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 5:1-2, 4-6, 11, 13, 16-25</h1>
<p>Galatians is a book on Christ versus many negative matters, such as the law with all the ordinances, religion with traditions, and the flesh. As long as we hold to one of these negative things, we are through with Christ in a practical way. If we try to keep the law with its ordinances, we are deprived of all profit from Christ (5:2), and if we still hold on to the traditions of religion, we are brought to nought and separated from Christ (v. 4). Moreover, if we live by the flesh, we are not living by Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit (vv. 16-17). On the negative side, Galatians exposes religion, traditions, the law, ordinances, and the flesh, and on the positive side, it shows us Christ for the producing of the church.</p>
<p>Each of the first four chapters of Galatians reveals a particular aspect of Christ. In chapter 1, Christ is revealed in us (vv. 15a, 16a). In chapter 2, Christ lives in us (v. 20). In chapter 3, we have been baptized into Christ and have put Him on (v. 27). At this point, Christ is in us, and we are in Christ. Then in chapter 4, this Christ needs to be formed within us. Verse 19 says, &ldquo;My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you.&rdquo; This is a strong word. Christ not only is revealed in us, is living in us, and is put upon us, but He is also being formed in us. This means that He is mingled with us. Our entire being with all its inward parts&mdash;our spirit, mind, will, and emotion&mdash;becomes the dwelling place of Christ.</p>
<p>We may illustrate our need for Christ to be formed in us with a hand and a glove. If only the tips of the fingers are in the glove, we still can say that the &ldquo;hand&rdquo; is in the glove, but this is not adequate. In the same way, we may declare that Christ lives in us, but He may not thoroughly dwell in us. For this reason, Paul travailed in birth that Christ would be formed in the believers. To travail is to labor much with suffering and struggling. After much travailing, Christ will be formed in us in a thorough way. Then we will be truly one with Him, and He will be one with us. Christ will make His home in every aspect, area, and avenue of our inward parts. This is altogether a matter of Christ being revealed in us, living in us, being put upon us, and being formed in us.</p>
<p>The experience of Christ in Galatians is not a matter of doing good or of keeping the law with its ordinances, religion with its traditions, or any rituals, forms, and regulations. Rather, Galatians shows us that we need to drop all these things. We need to leave the law behind, drop the ordinances, cast out religion, bury the traditions, and crucify the flesh. The Christian life is a matter only of Christ, not in an objective way but in a very subjective way. He is our life, our person, and the content of all our inward parts. Christ must be fully formed in every area of our being. Then we will be not only sons of God but also heirs of God, inheriting all that God is for our enjoyment (4:7). We do not care for the law, because we have God in Christ. We do not have a religion; we have Christ with all that God is. Moreover, we do not hold to traditions and ordinances; instead, we have the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICALITY OF THE CHURCH LIFE<br />
BEING CHRIST AS OUR ONENESS</h2>
<p>Because we drop all the negative matters and hold only to Christ, we are not confused and divided. Rather, we all are one in Christ. This oneness is the practicality of the church life. Formerly, many of us were scattered in the denominations and free groups. However, we can now boast to Satan, saying, &ldquo;Look at the oneness in the churches today. All the different kinds of people are one in Christ.&rdquo; We are one not in doctrines, the law, ordinances, religion, traditions, or any fleshly similarity. We are one in Christ. If all the real Christians would be like this, the kingdom of the heavens would spread throughout the earth. In this case, there would be no need for the United Nations. The earth does not need that kind of oneness. The true oneness is in the church life. The Lord will recover and carry out this oneness, not with the majority of Christians but with a minority as a remnant, in the principle of the overcomers.</p>
<p>We may compare the recovery of the church life to the reformation of the nation of Israel. Israel was reformed not with all the Jews on the earth but with only a minority. There are millions of Jews in New York City alone, but they are not the nation of Israel. The nation of Israel is composed of only the relatively few who returned to the land of their forefathers, remained there, and built it up. In the same principle, there are millions of Christians today, but as long as they are scattered, divided, and confused, they are not the church in practicality. Just as the Jews in New York City are true Jews, all genuine Christians are the members of the Body of Christ, but most of them are still scattered. However, a minority, a small number, a remnant, has been rescued from the divisions and confusion as well as from laws, ordinances, religion, and traditions. The Lord Jesus has gathered us here together as one. As long as we stand in this oneness, we can tell others, &ldquo;Come and see. This is the church!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Since we are real Christians, are we not also the church?&rdquo; To be sure, all the saved ones are genuine Christians, but many are still scattered in the denominations and divisions. If they would be rescued from the divisions, they will return to the practicality of the Body, where Christ Himself is our oneness. We ourselves may still be accustomed to certain kinds of ordinances, particularly in the practice of our meetings. However, we must avoid every ordinance, even those that appear to be good. We are here only for Christ as our oneness. This is the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. The Lord is recovering the proper church life, which is a life with Christ, by Christ, in Christ, and for Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
