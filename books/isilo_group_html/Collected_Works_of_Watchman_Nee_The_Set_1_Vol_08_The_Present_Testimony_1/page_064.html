If we want to walk in the Spirit, we have to listen to the leading of the conscience. Do not flee from the inner rebuking! Rather, listen carefully. If we want to walk constantly in the Spirit, we need to listen humbly and submissively to the reproving of the conscience. The believer should not make a sweeping confession, thinking that his mistakes are too many to enumerate. A vague confession will not give the conscience the opportunity for a thorough work. The believer should let the Holy Spirit reveal to him through the conscience all his sins one by one. He should humbly, quietly, and obediently allow the conscience to rebuke and condemn him of all his sins one by one. He should accept the rebuking of the conscience and be willing to eliminate everything that is against God, according to the thought of the Holy Spirit. Do you dare let the conscience inspect your life? Do you dare let the conscience tell you the real condition of your whole life? Are you willing to let the conscience lay out before you your living and behavior detail by detail according to God's thought? Are you willing to let the conscience operate on all your sins? If you dare not and are not willing, if you are filled with fears and reservations within, then you still have many more things in your life which need to be condemned and put on the cross; you have not obeyed yet. This shows that in many matters you have not completely obeyed God; you have not walked in full harmony with the Spirit. This also shows that there is not a thorough fellowship between you and your God; there are still many barriers in between. Thus, you cannot say to God, "There is no barrier between You and me."</P><P>Accepting the rebuking of the conscience, without condition and reservation, and willingly and absolutely following the conscience's revelation show whether or not our sacrifices to God are complete, whether or not we really hate sins, and whether or not we have an honest desire to do God's will. Many times we want to obey God; we want to walk in the Spirit; we want to be persons pleasing to God. Now is the time to test this willingness, to see if it is true or false, complete or defective. If we are still entangled with our sins and are not completely cut off from them, I am afraid that all our spirituality is unreal. If a believer cannot fully follow the conscience, he is not walking in the Spirit at all. Before a man has accepted the authority of the conscience, besides the spirit of imagination prompting him, the real Spirit is always pleading with him to listen to the conscience. If the believer feels condemned within and does not let himself be judged in God's light by repenting and having a thorough dealing, his spiritual life cannot have any real progress. You can tell whether a believer's consecration and work are real by merely observing whether or not he is fully obedient to the Lord --obedient to the Lord's command and the Lord's reproof.</P><P>After a believer allows his conscience to start functioning this way, he should not stop there. After one sin has been dealt with, he should go on to deal with other sins. He should go on step by step until all his sins are dealt with clearly. If a believer deals with his sins faithfully and follows his conscience faithfully, the heavenly light will shine in him more and more clearly. He will discover the sins that he neglected before. Day after day he will become clearer about the law which is written in his heart by the Holy Spirit, and he will be enabled to read and to recognize it. Thus, the believer will know what holiness, righteousness, pureness, and uprightness are. Formerly he was confused concerning these things, but now they are deeply engraved upon his heart. This is a great help to the intuition. It will increase its keenness in knowing the intention of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, while the believer's conscience is rebuking him, he should say to God, "I am willing to obey." He should let Christ be his Lord of life once more! He should be willing to be taught and trust in the teaching of the Holy Spirit. If the believer faithfully follows the conscience, the Holy Spirit will come and help him.</P><P>The conscience is the window of the believer's spirit. Heavenly light shines through this window, making the believer's spirit and whole being full of light. Likewise, the believer's whole being and spirit look upon the heavenly light through this window. Every time our thought, word, and behavior are wrong and unbecoming of the behavior of saints, the heavenly light shines in through the conscience to expose our mistakes and condemn our sins. If we let the conscience do its work, obey it, and deal with condemned sins, more heavenly light will shine next time. If we do not confess our mistakes or deal with sins, the stain of sins will remain, and our conscience will be defiled (Titus 1:15) because we do not follow the teaching of God's light. In this way one sin piles upon another, one scar adds to another, and the spiritual window becomes darker and darker day after day. It becomes harder and harder for the light to shine through, until the believer loses all sense of remorse in arbitrary sinning. His conscience is suppressed, and his intuition is numbed by sins. The more a believer becomes spiritual, the keener his conscience becomes. There is surely no believer so spiritual that he does not need to confess. If the conscience is dull or, even worse, insensitive, then the person must be fallen spiritually. Great knowledge, hard work, a stimulating emotion, and a firm will cannot replace the keenness of the conscience. If the believer does not pay attention to his conscience but only pursues the improvement of his mind and emotion, he is retrogressing in his spiritual path.</P><P>The degree of satisfying the conscience can be increased or decreased. If a believer gives room to his conscience to work, his spiritual window will become brighter and brighter. If the believer does not care for his conscience's voice but uses reasons and other works to supersede the requirement of the conscience as previously mentioned, the conscience will speak again and again. But after repeated attempts, it will stop speaking. The voice will become lower in each attempt until eventually there will be no more speaking. Each time the believer disregards his conscience's voice, his spiritual life is wounded. If the believer lets his spiritual life be wounded time after time, sooner or later he will fall into a position of being absolutely in the flesh. The hatred for sins and aspiration for victory, which previously characterized this believer's heart, will be gone. If we do not turn our face toward the conscience's rebuking, we will not know how important it is to listen to the conscience's voice in walking in the Spirit.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 08: The Present Testimony (1) &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
