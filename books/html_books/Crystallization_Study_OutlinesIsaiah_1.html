<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Isaiah (meaning &ldquo;the salvation of Jah&rdquo;) is the leading book among all the books of the prophets, and its subject is the salvation of Jehovah through the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, ascended, and coming Christ; this book is the vision that Isaiah saw (1:1), the word that Isaiah saw (2:1), and the burden that Isaiah saw (13:1; 15:1) concerning Christ as the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s eternal economy (9:6-7; 53:1-12; 40:10):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Isaiah reveals the history of the universe&mdash;from God&rsquo;s original creation through Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and Christ&rsquo;s processes to accomplish God&rsquo;s judicial redemption and His organic salvation for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ, to usher in the kingdom of God unto the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth&mdash;v. 22a; 45:18; 14:12-14; 53:5; 12:2-3; 65:17.</li>
	<li>Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy has a spiritual essence&mdash;the Christ who was processed for the divine purposes is the centrality and universality of the great wheel of the move of the Divine Trinity for the accomplishing of His economy in the divine dispensing of Himself into His elect&mdash;cf. Ezek. 1:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the book of Isaiah, God&rsquo;s love toward Israel is exercised in a threefold way: as a Father (1:2-3; 63:16; 64:8), as a nursing Mother (66:12-13), and as a Husband (54:5):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God deals with people according to what He is; as the Holy One (1:4), He chastises His people that they may be holy (Heb. 12:10), and as the righteous One (Isa. 24:16a), He judges the nations because they are not just and righteous (26:13).</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s dealing in love with His beloved Israel and His righteous judgment upon the nations bring in Christ, the Savior&mdash;43:3-4; 49:26.</li>
	<li>There is a divine, spiritual, and heavenly philosophy that dominates the book of Isaiah:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s chastising of Israel and His judgment on the nations who exercise excessive action upon Israel issue in three things:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Israel is brought back to God.</li>
			<li>The created things are restored.</li>
			<li>The all-inclusive Christ is ushered in.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>When Israel turns to God, there will be the restoration of all things, and then the all-inclusive Christ will be ushered in; this is the divine, spiritual, and heavenly philosophy that dominates the book of Isaiah, especially in the first thirty-nine chapters.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Isaiah, which has sixty-six chapters, is a representative of the entire Bible, which has sixty-six books:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first section (chs. 1&mdash;39) concerns God&rsquo;s governmental dealing with His beloved Israel and His punishing judgment on the nations so that Israel may be brought back to God and the all-inclusive Christ may be ushered in with the expected restoration of all things (11:6-9; 35:5-6; cf. Matt. 19:28).</li>
	<li>The last section (Isa. 40&mdash;66) is the kind word of Jehovah spoken to the heart of Israel, His beloved people; this word unveils the prophet&rsquo;s vision concerning the redeeming and saving Christ as the Servant of Jehovah and reveals the all-inclusive salvation brought in by Christ to Israel and the nations, with the full restoration of all things, consummating in the new heaven and new earth.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Isaiah reveals the Triune God coming out of eternity into time and with His divinity into humanity to pass through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy to produce and build up the church as the Body of Christ and to usher in the kingdom age, consummating in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Isaiah reveals the forerunner of Christ, preparing the way for Christ&mdash;40:1-5.</li>

	<li>Isaiah reveals the human living of Christ&mdash;7:14-15; 40:9b; 53:2-3; 61:1-2a; 9:2; 49:5a; 42:1-4; 11:1-2.</li>
	<li>Isaiah reveals the crucifixion of Christ&mdash;53:4-10a, 12b.</li>
	<li>Isaiah reveals the resurrection of Christ&mdash;vv. 10b-11.</li>
	<li>Isaiah reveals the ascension of Christ&mdash;52:13; 53:12a.</li>

	<li>Isaiah reveals the coming kingdom of Christ&mdash;2:2-5; 11:6-9; 35:1-10; 30:26.</li>

	<li>Christ is the Angel of Jehovah, the Angel of His presence&mdash;63:9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Isaiah speaks of God&rsquo;s building as the goal of God; the church with its ultimate manifestation, the New Jerusalem, is the house of Jehovah&rsquo;s beauty&mdash;1 Cor. 3:9, 12a; Rev. 21:3, 18-22; Psa. 27:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The house of Jehovah as His dwelling place is the mingling and the mutual abode of God and man&mdash;Isa. 57:15; 66:1-2; John 14:2, 20, 23; 15:4; 1 John 4:13.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;I will beautify the house of My beauty&rdquo;&mdash;God beautifies us by dispensing Himself into us&mdash;Isa. 60:7b.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Jehovah your God / ...The Holy One of Israel...He has beautified you&rdquo;&mdash;v. 9c.</li>

		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the New Jerusalem we will enjoy Jehovah in Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, as the eternal light&mdash;vv. 19-20; Rev. 21:23; 22:5.</li>
		<li>In the restoration God in Christ will be our glory and beauty, and we will be Christ&rsquo;s glory and beauty; thus, God and His chosen people will be glorified and beautified in mutuality&mdash;Isa. 60:21; 61:3b; Eph. 3:21; cf. Exo. 28:2.</li>
		<li>This will be accomplished by the divine dispensing through Christ as the Redeemer and the Savior putting Himself, as the life-giving Spirit and the word, into God&rsquo;s people&mdash;Isa. 59:21; Eph. 5:26-27; S. S. 1:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Isaiah speaks of the enjoyment of Christ for God&rsquo;s building:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to see a revelation of our fallen condition and the revelation of Christ in glory&mdash;Isa. 1:18; 57:20-21; 64:6-8; 6:1-8.</li>

45:15; 29:16; 54:5; 12:2-3; 66:2</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li><em>Elohim</em> is the name of God in relation to creation, whereas <em>Jehovah</em> is the name of God in relation to man&mdash;Gen. 1:1; 2:4; Isa. 1:2, 4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Jehovah</em> means &ldquo;I am who I am,&rdquo; indicating that Jehovah is the self-existing and ever-existing eternal One, the One who was in the past, who is in the present, and who will be in the future forever&mdash;Exo. 3:14; Rev. 1:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jehovah is the only One who is and who depends on nothing apart from Himself, and we must believe that He is&mdash;Heb. 11:6.</li>
		<li>As the I Am, He is the all-inclusive One, the reality of every positive thing and of whatever His people need&mdash;John 6:35; 8:12; 10:14; 11:25; 14:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Jehovah in the Old Testament is the Jesus in the New Testament&mdash;Matt. 1:21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Jesus</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the salvation of Jehovah&rdquo;; hence, Jesus is not only a man but Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation&mdash;v. 21.</li>
		<li>As the great I Am, the Lord Jesus is the eternal, ever-existing God who has a relationship with man; anyone who does not believe that Jesus is I Am will die in his sins&mdash;John 8:24, 28, 58.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord Jehovah is the Lord Jesus Christ; the Lord Jehovah is the Old Testament Lord Jesus Christ, and the Lord Jesus Christ is the New Testament Lord Jehovah&mdash;Isa. 25:8; Eph. 1:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jehovah is the eternal God&mdash;Isa. 40:28:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Hebrew <em>the eternal God</em> is <em>Elohey Olam</em> (cf. <em>El Olam,</em> Gen. 21:33):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>El,</em> meaning &ldquo;the Mighty One,&rdquo; is one of the names of God; <em>Olam,</em> meaning &ldquo;eternal&rdquo; or &ldquo;eternity,&rdquo; comes from a Hebrew root meaning &ldquo;to conceal, to hide.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>The full meaning of this title indicates that the Lord Jehovah is the mysterious Mighty One in eternity.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The divine title <em>El Olam</em> implies eternal life (John 1:4; 3:15); by calling on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal Mighty One, Abraham experienced God as the ever-living, secret, mysterious One, who is the eternal life&mdash;Gen. 21:33; John 20:31.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jehovah is the only God&mdash;Isa. 40:18; 44:6, 8, 24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jehovah is the unique Creator&mdash;the majestic, exalted One, who inhabits eternity&mdash;Gen. 1:1; Rev. 4:11; Isa. 42:5; 45:18; 57:15; 2:10-21; 10:34.</li>
	<li>As the holy and righteous One, Jehovah deals with people according to what He is&mdash;51:8; 17:7; 29:23; 24:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Righteousness is the base for holiness, and on this base holiness is exhibited; with His righteousness as the base, God shows Himself as the holy God, in righteousness exhibiting His holiness&mdash;5:16.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s chastening and disciplining is to uplift us from righteousness to holiness&mdash;Heb. 12:5-11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In His salvation He first justifies us to make us righteous in Christ, and then He sanctifies us to make us holy&mdash;Rom. 3:24; 6:19, 22.</li>
			<li>To be righteous is to match God&rsquo;s way of doing things outwardly, but to be holy is to match God&rsquo;s nature inwardly; hence, holiness is higher than righteousness&mdash;Phil. 3:9; Heb. 12:10, 14; Rev. 19:8; 21:2; 22:11.</li>
			<li>While the Lord is chastening us, we should wait for Him in the path of His judging in order to learn the lesson that He would give us; God&rsquo;s judgments always teach us lessons in righteousness&mdash;Isa. 26:8-9.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jehovah is triune&mdash;6:8; 11:2; 42:1; 61:1; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jehovah&mdash;the threefold yet one unique God&mdash;is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; this implies that He is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;Exo. 3:6, 14-15; Matt. 28:19.</li>
	<li>The words <em>I</em> and <em>Us</em> in Isaiah 6:8 indicate that the One speaking here is triune, that He is not merely Christ but Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God&mdash;Col. 2:9; John 1:1, 14; 12:41.</li>
	<li>According to the entire divine revelation in the Scriptures, the Triune God is for God&rsquo;s dispensing: the Father as the origin is the fountain, the Son as the expression is the spring, and the Spirit as the transmission is the flow&mdash;John 4:14; 7:37-39; Rev. 22:1-2; Isa. 12:2-3.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jehovah is a God who hides Himself&mdash;45:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although our God is omnipresent, omnipotent, and full of forgiveness, He is also the hiding God, as the book of Esther indicates; He created the universe and then hid Himself within it, until we do not know where to find Him&mdash;Job 23:3-9.</li>
	<li>We need to realize that the omnipotent God whom we are serving is still hiding Himself, especially when He is helping us&mdash;John 14:26; Rom. 8:26:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We cannot see Him, and apparently He is not doing anything; actually, in a hidden way He is doing many things for us&mdash;vv. 28, 34; Esth. 4:14.</li>
		<li>Silently, secretly, and ceaselessly, the God who hides Himself is working within us&mdash;Phil. 2:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jehovah reveals Himself by speaking&mdash;Isa. 40:5, 8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Without His speaking, God is mysterious, but He has revealed Himself in His speaking, and now He is the revealed God&mdash;Heb. 1:1; Isa. 40:5, 8.</li>
	<li>Jesus was sent by God for the purpose of speaking the word of God for God&rsquo;s expression&mdash;John 3:34a; 7:16; 14:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The word of God is actually Christ, the embodiment of God&mdash;Isa. 40:8; Col. 2:9.</li>
		<li>In the word&mdash;the speaking&mdash;of Jesus, God is unveiled and presented to men so that they may see God&mdash;John 14:7-10.</li>
		<li>The Son, as the Word of God and the speaking of God, has declared God with a full expression, explanation, and definition of Him&mdash;1:1, 14, 18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jehovah is the Potter&mdash;Isa. 29:16; 64:8; Jer. 18:6; Rom. 9:20-21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jehovah is the Potter, and we are the clay in His hand&mdash;Jer. 18:1-6.</li>
	<li>As the Potter, God is sovereign and has absolute authority over us; He has the right to do whatever He desires&mdash;Rom. 9:20-21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If He wills, He can make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor; this does not depend on our choice&mdash;it depends on God&rsquo;s sovereignty&mdash;v. 21.</li>
		<li>It is of God&rsquo;s sovereignty that He, the Potter, makes the riches of His glory known by creating vessels of mercy to contain Himself&mdash;v. 23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jehovah is our Husband&mdash;Isa. 54:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The entire Bible is a divine romance, a record of how God courts His chosen people and eventually marries them&mdash;Gen. 2:21-24; Rev. 19:7; 21:2, 9-10.</li>
	<li>Both the Major Prophets and the Minor Prophets speak of God as the Husband and of God&rsquo;s chosen people as the wife&mdash;Isa. 62:5; Hosea 2:16, 19.</li>
	<li>The crucial emphasis of the revelation released by all the prophets from Isaiah to Malachi is that God wants to have an organic union with His chosen people&mdash;Isa. 62:5; Jer. 2:2; 3:14; 31:32; Ezek. 16:8; 23:5; Hosea 2:7, 19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In this union God is His people&rsquo;s life, and they are His expression.</li>
		<li>In this way God and His chosen people become a universal couple; this is God&rsquo;s intention in His eternal economy&mdash;John 3:29; 2 Cor. 11:2; Rev. 22:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jehovah is our salvation&mdash;Isa. 12:2-3; 17:10; 1:18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Isaiah 12:2 clearly reveals that salvation is God Himself; in the New Testament Jah Jehovah, who is salvation, is Jesus, the incarnated God&mdash;Luke 2:30.</li>
	<li>As the eternal Rock, Christ is the God of our salvation&mdash;Isa. 17:10.</li>
	<li>In God&rsquo;s full salvation He not only forgives our sins, exempting us from the penalty of our sins and removing the record of our sins from before Him; He also washes away the traces of sins in us, making us as white as snow and white like wool&mdash;1:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The washing that makes us as white as snow is a positional washing from without through the blood of Jesus Christ&mdash;1 John 1:7; Heb. 1:3b; Rev. 1:5.</li>
		<li>The washing that makes us white like wool is a washing of our nature metabolically from within by God&rsquo;s Spirit and by His life&mdash;1 Cor. 6:11; Titus 3:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jehovah has become the divine water&mdash;Isa. 12:3; 55:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Both the Old Testament and the New Testament show that God&rsquo;s practical salvation is the processed Triune God Himself as the living water&mdash;12:2-3; 55:1; Rev. 7:10, 14, 17; 21:6; 22:1, 17.</li>
	<li>In the book of Isaiah God considers that He is our salvation as living water&mdash;12:2-3; 55:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be our salvation, the Triune God was processed to become the life-giving Spirit as the living water, the water of life&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; John 7:37-39.</li>
		<li>The waters in Isaiah 55:1 and Revelation 22:17 are the redeeming God, the very God who accomplished redemption for us through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</li>
		<li>In totality, what Christ is and has accomplished is just the divine water, which is the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God for us to drink and enjoy&mdash;Isa. 55:1; John 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 12:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jehovah will deal with His enemies&mdash;Isa. 14:12-15; 24:21; 27:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Isaiah identifies Lucifer with Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, thus regarding him as a figure of Satan, as one who was one with Satan; this unveils Satan&rsquo;s kingdom of darkness behind the nations and his oneness with the rulers of the nations&mdash;14:4, 12-15; Ezek. 28:12; Dan. 10:13, 20; Eph. 6:12b.</li>
	<li>In Isaiah 24:21 <em>the host on high</em> refers to Satan and his angels in the air (cf. Eph. 2:2; 6:12); Jehovah&rsquo;s reaction to the nations&rsquo; excessive action on Israel deals both with Satan&rsquo;s army in the air and with the kings on the earth&mdash;Rev. 12:7-10; 11:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jehovah desires to have as His dwelling place a group of people into whom He can enter&mdash;Isa. 57:15; 66:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God intends to have a dwelling place in the universe that is the mingling of God and man, in which God is built into man and man is built into God, so that God and man, man and God, can be a mutual abode to each other&mdash;John 14:2, 20, 23; 15:4; 1 John 4:13.</li>
	<li>In the New Testament this dwelling place, this house, is the church, which is God&rsquo;s habitation in the believers&rsquo; spirit&mdash;Eph. 2:22; 1 Tim. 3:15.</li>
	<li>The ultimate manifestation of this universal building, this universal house, is the New Jerusalem; in this city God is in man, taking man as His dwelling place, and man is in God, taking God as his habitation&mdash;Rev. 21:3, 22; Gen. 28:12, 17; 2 Sam. 7:12-14.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 4:2-6; 2:2-5</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li><em>In that day</em> in Isaiah 4:2 refers to the coming restoration of the nation of Israel&mdash;Matt. 17:11; 19:28; Acts 1:6; 3:21; 15:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Basically, between eternity past and eternity future, there are three ages&mdash;the age of the old creation, the age of the new creation, and the age of restoration:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>From God&rsquo;s creation of the heavens and the earth in Genesis 1:1 to the beginning of the age of grace is the age of the old creation.</li>
		<li>The age of grace is the age of the new creation; the work of God in the age of grace is to produce the new creation&mdash;John 1:16-17; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.</li>
		<li>The coming age will be the age of restoration&mdash;Matt. 19:28; Acts 3:21:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the coming age God will neither create nor produce the new creation; rather, He will do the work of restoring the old, fallen creation&mdash;Rom. 8:20-22.</li>
			<li>A restoration will be brought to all things; in this restoration death will be limited, and there will be abundant life and much praise and rejoicing&mdash;Isa. 65:18-25.</li>
			<li>After the age of restoration, the entire universe will be changed from the old to the new; then there will be the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem&mdash;v. 17; 66:22; Rev. 21:1-2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Isaiah prophesied concerning the age of restoration (Isa. 2:2-5; 11:1-10; 61:4-9); chapter 35 is a marvelous picture of restoration.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s judgment on the haughty nations ushers in the God-man, Christ (4:2, 5-6), issuing in the restoration of the nation of Israel (vv. 3-6; 2:2-5), which brings in the kingdom and consummates in the new heaven and new earth (65:17).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Christ is the center and the circumference, the centrality and the universality, of God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Col. 1:15-18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the embodiment of the Triune God, Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe&mdash;2:16-17.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is that Christ be everything; therefore, it is crucial for us to see that God wants nothing but Christ and that in the eyes of God nothing counts except Christ&mdash;vv. 16-17; 3:4, 10-11.</li>
	<li>Because Christ is the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s move, the book of Isaiah reveals many aspects of Christ for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;6:1-8; 22:22; 53:5, 10b-12; 54:5; 55:4-5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In 4:2 there is a pair of aspects of Christ&mdash;the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth; <em>the Shoot</em> is in comparison to <em>the Fruit,</em> and <em>Jehovah</em> is in comparison to <em>the earth:</em>
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is eternal, and man came from the earth; <em>the Fruit of the earth</em> refers to a man made from dust&mdash;Gen. 2:7.</li>
	<li>Christ as God came from eternity, but as man He came from the earth, so He is the Shoot of Jehovah and also the Fruit of the earth.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li><em>The Shoot of Jehovah</em> refers to Christ&rsquo;s deity, showing His divine nature&mdash;Isa. 4:2a; John 1:1; 20:28; Rom. 9:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Shoot of Jehovah typifies not only Christ&rsquo;s divinity but also the sprouting and development of Christ&rsquo;s divinity through the incarnation of God&mdash;John 1:1, 14; Heb. 1:1-3; 2:14.</li>
	<li>The Shoot of Jehovah is a new development of Jehovah God for the Triune God to branch Himself out for His increase and spreading through His incarnation&mdash;Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:22-23.</li>
	<li>In His incarnation Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah branched Himself out in His divinity from the territory of divinity into the territory of humanity&mdash;John 1:1, 14.</li>
	<li>In His incarnation Christ came from eternity into time; from ancient times, from the days of eternity, the Triune God was preparing to come forth out of eternity into time, to come with His divinity into humanity&mdash;Micah 5:2.</li>
	<li>The sprouting and development of God in Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah are for the expression of all the riches of divinity in Christ&rsquo;s humanity, that is, for the rich attributes of divinity to be developed into the virtues of Christ, the God-man, in His humanity&mdash;Eph. 3:8.</li>
	<li>The incarnated God, in His divinity, will be the beauty and glory of God&rsquo;s chosen people in the day of restoration&mdash;Isa. 4:2a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our God with His divine nature is our beauty and our glory&mdash;60:1, 9, 13.</li>
		<li>Because Christ lives in us, we are partakers of the divine nature; in this sense, we are not only human but also divine, and the divine nature is our beauty and our glory&mdash;Gal. 2:20; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li><em>The Fruit of the earth</em> refers to Christ&rsquo;s humanity with His human nature&mdash;Isa. 4:2b; Luke 1:42:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the Fruit of the earth, Christ was born a man of human blood and flesh from the earth; the earth was the source of Christ&rsquo;s humanity, just as eternity was the source of His divinity&mdash;Heb. 2:14.</li>
	<li>Christ as the Fruit of the earth is for the multiplication and reproduction of the divine life in humanity&mdash;John 12:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God in Himself, in His divinity, has no way to be multiplied.</li>
		<li>For His multiplication and reproduction, He needs humanity; humanity is the soil, the earth, for the Triune God to be multiplied and reproduced&mdash;20:17; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the Fruit of the earth, Christ, in His humanity, which expresses His divine beauty and glory, will be the excellence and splendor of God&rsquo;s chosen people in the day of restoration&mdash;Isa. 4:2b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Even today in the age of grace, we should live a life that expresses Christ&rsquo;s beauty and glory in a divine way and that expresses Christ&rsquo;s excellence and splendor in a human way&mdash;1 Cor. 10:31; Phil. 1:11, 20.</li>
		<li>A proper Christian is both divine and human, having the divine beauty and glory of Jesus and the human excellence and splendor of Jesus&mdash;vv. 8-9; 1 Pet. 2:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Isaiah 4:5-6 there is a second pair of aspects of Christ&mdash;a covering canopy of glory and an overshadowing tabernacle of grace:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The second pair is the issue of the first pair and is produced by the first pair:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because Christ is the Shoot for God&rsquo;s new development and the Fruit for God&rsquo;s reproduction, He has the divine beauty and glory with the human excellence and splendor; therefore, He can be a canopy covering us and a tabernacle overshadowing us&mdash;vv. 2, 5-6.</li>
		<li>Our Jesus is the God-man, the One who is both divine and human; as the God-man in His divinity and humanity, He, the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth, is a covering canopy of the divine glory and an overshadowing tabernacle of grace in humanity.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The God-man, Christ, is a canopy, which is the covering glory of Christ in His divinity that covers all the interests of Jehovah God on earth&mdash;v. 5.</li>
	<li>The overshadowing tabernacle is the God-man, Christ, in His humanity with His grace, as illustrated in 2 Corinthians 12:9; this is Christ as our overshadowing protection and defense&mdash;Isa. 4:6; John 1:14.</li>
	</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">The Vision of Christ in Glory</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 6:1-8; John 12:38-41</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>&ldquo;In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the temple&rdquo;&mdash;Isa. 6:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The One who was seen by Isaiah was Christ as the Lord, the King, Jehovah of hosts&mdash;v. 5b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>John, in his account of Christ&rsquo;s living and working on earth, said that Isaiah &ldquo;saw His glory and spoke concerning Him&rdquo;&mdash;John 12:41.</li>
		<li>In order to see the vision of the glorious enthroned Christ, we need to take heed to Isaiah&rsquo;s warning word (Isa. 6:9-10) by exercising our spirit to pray that the Lord would open our inner eyes, soften our heart, and keep our heart turned to Him so that we may receive His inner healing of our blindness and sickness (John 12:38-40; Matt. 13:14-17; Acts 28:25-27; Rev. 3:18; 4:2; 2 Cor. 3:16-18).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The vision of Christ in glory was seen by Isaiah in his depression&mdash;Isa. 6:1, 5; cf. 22:1; 2 Chron. 26:3-5, 16-22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In spite of the rebellion, iniquities, and corruptions of God&rsquo;s chosen and beloved people, Christ is still sitting on a high and lofty throne in glory&mdash;Isa. 6:1-4; Lam. 5:19; Rev. 22:1.</li>
		<li>Christ is the unique good thing in the universe; we must look at Him with undivided attention by turning away from every other object; we should not look at anything or anyone other than Christ&mdash;Heb. 12:1-2a.</li>
		<li>On this earth everything changes and fluctuates, but Christ remains the same today and forever; hence, we should not look down at the situation on earth but should look up to Christ on the throne&mdash;v. 2; 13:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s long robe signifies His splendor in His virtues, expressed mainly in and through His humanity; that Christ was wearing a long robe indicates that He appeared to Isaiah in the image of a man; Christ is the enthroned God-man with the divine glory expressed in His human virtues&mdash;Isa. 6:1; cf. Ezek. 1:26, 22; Acts 2:36; Heb. 2:9a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Seraphim hovered over Him, each having six wings: With two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to the other, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts; / The whole earth is filled with His glory&rdquo;&mdash;Isa. 6:2-3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Isaiah saw the long robe signifying Christ&rsquo;s splendor in His virtues, and the seraphim were praising Christ in His holiness and declaring that the whole earth is filled with Christ&rsquo;s glory.</li>
	<li>Isaiah saw Christ in His divine glory with His human virtues and His holiness based on His righteousness:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The seraphim signify or represent the holiness of Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God; they were standing there for Christ&rsquo;s holiness.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s holiness is based on His righteousness; because Christ was always righteous, He was sanctified, separated, from the common people&mdash;5:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;And the foundations of the threshold shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. Then I said, Woe is me, for I am finished! / For I am a man of unclean lips, / And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell; / Yet my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts&rdquo;&mdash;6:4-5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The shaking of the foundations of the threshold signifies solemnity, and the house being filled with smoke signifies glory burning in awe&mdash;cf. 4:5.</li>
	<li>As a result of seeing this vision, Isaiah was terminated, finished, realizing that he was a man of unclean lips, dwelling in the midst of a people of unclean lips&mdash;6:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Revelation comprises seeing as well as killing; the greatest thing in the Christian experience is the killing that comes from light.</li>
		<li>The more we see God, the more we see what we are and the more we deny ourselves and hate ourselves&mdash;Job 42:5-6; Psa. 36:9; Eph. 5:13; Luke 5:8.</li>
		<li>Everyone who truly sees a vision of the Lord in His glory is enlightened in his conscience concerning his uncleanness&mdash;cf. v. 8.</li>
		<li>A great percentage of the words that we speak are evil because most of the words are words of criticism; if we eliminate gossip, murmuring, and reasoning, we may find that we have very little to talk about&mdash;Phil. 2:12-14; cf. Luke 6:45; Eph. 4:29-30; 1 Pet. 1:15-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>How much we realize concerning ourselves depends upon how much we see the Lord; for this reason we need a revival every morning; morning revival is the time for us to see the Lord&mdash;Matt. 5:8; Psa. 27:4, 8.</li>
	<li>The more we see the Lord and are measured by the Lord, the more we are cleansed, supplied, and transformed&mdash;Ezek. 40:3; 47:3-5.</li>
	<li>Seeing God transforms us because in seeing God, we gain God and receive His element into us&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Then one of the seraphim flew to me with an ember in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. And he touched my mouth with it and said, Now that this has touched your lips, / Your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged&rdquo;&mdash;Isa. 6:6-7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>After Isaiah realized that he was unclean, he was purged by one of the seraphim, signifying the holiness of God&mdash;v. 6a.</li>
	<li>Isaiah was purged with an ember from the altar; the application of this ember by the seraphim signifies the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s redemption accomplished on the cross and applied by &ldquo;the Spirit, the Holy&rdquo; in His judging, burning, and sanctifying power&mdash;vv. 6b-7a; 4:4; cf. Luke 12:49; Rev. 4:5.</li>
	<li>This purging by the seraphim with an ember from the altar took away Isaiah&rsquo;s iniquity and purged his sin&mdash;Isa. 6:7b.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us? And I said, Here am I; send me&rdquo;&mdash;v. 8; cf. John 17:21; 20:21-22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Seeing God issues in being purged and cleansed by God, and being cleansed by God issues in being sent by God&mdash;Isa. 6:6-8; 1 John 1:7-9.</li>
	<li>The words <em>I</em> and <em>Us</em> indicate that the One speaking is triune and that this One is not merely Christ but Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God&mdash;Isa. 6:8a; Col. 2:9.</li>
	<li>The Triune God sends us to bring His chosen people into a state of living Christ so that they might express Him in His glory, be saturated with His holiness, and live in His righteousness&mdash;Isa. 6:8b; Acts 13:47; Isa. 49:6; Phil. 1:21a.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Sign of Christ&rsquo;s Incarnation<br />
and<br />
the Unveiling of Christ as the Wonderful One</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 7:11-14; 8:8; 9:6-7; 63:16; 64:8</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Regarding God&rsquo;s economy, the intrinsic connection between the books of history in the Old Testament and their fulfillment in the New Testament is in Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6; these verses indicate that God would put humanity upon Himself, thereby mingling divinity with humanity&mdash;John 1:14; Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20.</li>
<li>In Isaiah 7:14 we have the sign of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jehovah wanted Ahaz, king of Judah, to ask for a sign (vv. 10-25); this sign is related to the ushering in of Christ, who was born of a virgin.</li>
	<li>Isaiah prophesied that the very God of Israel would become a human child born of a virgin and that His name would be called Immanuel&mdash;v. 14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The sign of a virgin conceiving and bearing a son covers the entire Bible from Genesis 11 through Revelation 22.</li>
		<li>The actual fulfillment of this sign was the birth of a son by Isaiah&rsquo;s wife; the ultimate fulfillment was the incarnation, in which Jesus Christ was born of the virgin Mary as a child of a dual nature, the divine nature and the human nature, issuing in Immanuel, &ldquo;God with us&rdquo;&mdash;Isa. 8:3; Matt. 1:23; Luke 1:35.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The land of Immanuel (Isa. 8:8) is the land of Judah, the Holy Land, as the territory of Immanuel, God with us; this land, which was invaded by the army of Assyria, is the land that Christ will inherit to build up His millennial kingdom with His two elect peoples, the chosen Jews as His earthly people and the chosen believers as His heavenly people.</li>
	<li>We should consider the sign of a virgin conceiving and bearing a son&mdash;the sign of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation&mdash;in relation to Satan&rsquo;s use of Babylon to oppose God and God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;13:1, 19; 14:4, 11-15; 21:9; 47:1; 48:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the Bible the result of Satan&rsquo;s work is Babylon; his opposition to God began with Babylon and will end with Babylon&mdash;Gen. 11:1-9; Rev. 17&mdash;18.</li>
		<li>Babylon was the worst nation in offending God, and its king was one with Satan (Isa. 14:4, 11-15); therefore, Babylon is God&rsquo;s number one enemy, being both the beginning and the conclusion of human government, and it will be thoroughly judged, condemned, and punished by God&mdash;21:9; Jer. 51:8-9; Rev. 14:8; 18:2.</li>
		<li>Even the termination of Babylon is included in the sign of a virgin bearing a son called Immanuel&mdash;Isa. 7:14; 8:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 concerning Immanuel can be seen in fulfillment in Matthew 1:20-23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The child born of a human virgin is Emmanuel, God with man:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God was begotten in the virgin Mary of the Holy Spirit&mdash;v. 20.</li>
			<li>The child born of Mary was a &ldquo;God-man child&rdquo;&mdash;a divine-human child.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God Himself came to be both God and man, the God-man, to be Jesus&mdash;Jehovah the Savior&mdash;v. 21.</li>
		<li>Jesus was the name given by God, whereas Emmanuel was the name by which man called Him&mdash;v. 23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He was called by those who experienced Him Emmanuel&mdash;God with us.</li>
			<li>The more we experience the Lord Jesus, the more we will know that He is Emmanuel.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The practical Immanuel, the presence of the Triune God, is the Spirit of reality&mdash;John 1:14; 14:16-20; 1 Cor. 15:45b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He is with us in our gatherings and all our days&mdash;Matt. 18:20; 28:20.</li>
		<li>He is with us in our spirit, which today is the land of Immanuel&mdash;2 Tim. 4:22; Isa. 8:6-8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Immanuel is all-inclusive&mdash;Phil. 1:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He is first our Savior (Luke 2:11), then our Redeemer (John 1:29; Rom. 3:24), then our Life-giver (1 Cor. 15:45b), and then the all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit (John 14:16-20; Rom. 8:9-11).</li>
		<li>Actually, the content of the entire New Testament is an Immanuel (Matt. 1:23; 18:20; 28:20; Rev. 21:3), and all the believers in Christ, as the members of Christ, are a part of this great Immanuel, the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12; Col. 3:10-11).</li>
		<li>The sign of Immanuel consummates in the New Jerusalem, which will be the aggregate of Immanuel, the totality of God being with us&mdash;Rev. 21:2-3, 10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Isaiah 9:6-7 we have the unveiling of Christ as the wonderful One:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is mentioned as a child born to us and as a Son given to us&mdash;v. 6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The words <em>to us</em> indicate that this is not a doctrine but an experience.</li>
		<li>The repetition of <em>to us</em> indicates a strong emphasis, showing that whatever is revealed in this verse is <em>to us</em> in a very personal, subjective, and experiential way.</li>
		<li>Christ as the child, the Son, the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Eternal Father, and the Prince of Peace is for our experience&mdash;v. 6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The child born to us is both human and divine, and the Son given to us is divine:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The divine Son was given through the birth of the divine-human child&mdash;John 3:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The word <em>child</em> in Isaiah 9:6 implies God, implies man, implies God becoming a man, and implies God and man mingled together as one.</li>
			<li>This child of both the divine and human natures born of a human virgin is also the Son given in the divine nature by the Eternal Father.</li>
			<li>The child born in verse 6 is the One born of a virgin and called Immanuel in 7:14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Eternal Father gave us a gift, and that gift was His Son, who became the God-man&mdash;John 3:16; 4:10; Rom. 6:23; 1 John 5:11-12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Mighty God is the name of the child, and Eternal Father&mdash;the Father in the Godhead&mdash;is the name of the Son&mdash;Isa. 63:16; 64:8; John 5:43; 10:30; 14:10, 26.</li>
	<li>Isaiah 9:6 reveals clearly that the child is the Mighty God and that the Son is the Eternal Father:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Son in Isaiah 9:6 bears two main denotations:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>One denotation is that He is the son of a human virgin who was born of her; the other denotation is that He is also the Son of the Most High&mdash;7:14; Matt. 1:23; Luke 1:32.</li>
			<li>The Son as the son of Mary with the human nature was born, and the Son as the Son of the Most High with the divine nature was given through the birth of the son of Mary&mdash;vv. 31-33.</li>
			<li>This wonderful Son was born of the human source and given from the divine source; He is both human and divine&mdash;John 3:16; Gal. 4:4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>According to Isaiah 9:6, the Son given to us is called the Eternal Father, the Father of eternity, the One who is self-existing and ever-existing:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Father in the Godhead is the Father of eternity, and according to verse 6 the Son is also the Father of eternity, the Eternal Father.</li>
			<li>There is only one Eternal Father, the Father who is self-existing and ever-existing.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Isaiah 9:6 is confirmed and strengthened by John 14:7-11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In verse 9 the Lord said, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father.&rdquo;</li>
			<li>The Father and the Son are one; thus, if we confess the Son, we have the Father also&mdash;10:30; 1 John 2:23.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The prophet Isaiah uses 63:16 and 64:8 as a further development of what he prophesied concerning Christ as the Eternal Father in 9:6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In 64:8 he says that the Eternal Father is our Creator, and in 63:16, that the Eternal Father is our Redeemer.</li>
			<li>The Eternal Father being both our Creator and our Redeemer confirms and strengthens the understanding that the Redeemer, Christ, is the Eternal Father, the holy Father in the Godhead.</li>
			<li>From the revelation in the entire book of Isaiah, we can conclude that <em>Eternal Father</em> in 9:6 refers to both Jehovah and Jesus; hence, although He is the Son, His name is called Eternal Father.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>For the government to be upon Christ&rsquo;s shoulder means that the divine administration is upon the shoulder of this child who is born and this Son who is given&mdash;v. 6.</li>
	<li>Christ is the Wonderful Counselor; our Counselor is the Mighty God, who gives us counsel and is the power and strength to carry out this counsel&mdash;v. 6.</li>
	<li>The title <em>Prince of Peace</em> is related to government&mdash;vv. 6-7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we have Christ as the Prince of Peace, we have His ruling, His government, and we enjoy His peace, which comes from His inner ruling&mdash;Eph. 2:14-15; 4:3; Col. 3:15.</li>
		<li>The government, which is upon His shoulder, will be increased with His peace without end&mdash;Isa. 9:7.</li>
		<li>He will be upon the throne of David to rule over His kingdom and to establish His kingdom in justice and righteousness, first in the millennial kingdom and then in the new heaven and new earth unto eternity&mdash;Luke 1:31-33.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6-7 we have the high peak of the divine revelation:

	<li>The physical light in Genesis 1:3 is a type of Christ as the spiritual light for the new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 4:6; 5:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Light is necessary for generating life; according to a great principle in the Bible, light is for life, and where light is, there is life&mdash;John 8:12; 1:9, 12.</li>
		<li>In Genesis light is for the old creation, but in the Gospel of John light is for the new creation; the old creation was brought into existence through physical light, whereas the new creation is brought into being through Christ as spiritual light&mdash;vv. 4-5, 9, 12; 8:12; 12:36; 2 Cor. 4:6.</li>

	<li>The prophecy in Isaiah 9:2 was fulfilled in Matthew 4:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When Christ came to Galilee, the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, light sprang up.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s ministry did not begin with earthly power but with heavenly light:

		</ol></li>
	<li>We can see the Christian life in Isaiah 9:1-5 with the enjoyment of Christ as the great light; through His shining, He saves us and breaks the yoke of our burden, the staff on our shoulder, and the rod of our oppressor.</li>
	<li>Christ was called by Jehovah to be a light for the nations&mdash;42:6:

<h1 class="title">Enjoying Christ<br />
as the Sprout and the Branch<br />
to Grow in Christ<br />
and as the Banner and the Standard<br />
to Propagate Christ<br />
in the Principle of the Restoration of Life<br />
for a New Revival</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 11:1-16</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In studying Isaiah 11:1-16, our emphasis is not on its future fulfillment but on the principle of the restoration of life; Isaiah 11 describes the scene of a recovery, a revival, a restoration&mdash;v. 1; Heb. 6:5; Acts 3:19-21.</li>
<li>We need to enjoy Christ in the principle of the restoration of life as a sprout from the stump of Jesse and as a branch from the roots of Jesse&mdash;Isa. 11:1-9; Heb. 6:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is typified by a sprout from the stump of the great tree of the house of David, which had been hewn down to the roots; Christ&rsquo;s coming in incarnation as the sprout from the stump of Jesse was the revival of David&rsquo;s deprived and &ldquo;hewn down&rdquo; royal family&mdash;Ruth 4:17b; cf. Isa. 10:32-34:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>According to our thought, Christ has two comings, but according to God&rsquo;s realization, He has sent His Son once for all; when Jesus was born, that was the beginning of God&rsquo;s sending His Son to the earth, and this sending is still going on; it will be completed at the time the Son of Man comes to the earth in an open way&mdash;Matt. 24:27.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s coming forth, His going forth, His appearing, is a continuous matter; at the time of His incarnation He began to come forth; then He continued to go forth through His human living, His death, His resurrection, His ascension, His outpouring of the consummated Spirit (who is the reality of Christ Himself), His spreading through the preaching of the gospel to the whole inhabited earth, and His growing within the believers and the church&mdash;Micah 5:2.</li>
		<li>The completion of His being sent by God is accomplished in three ways: by His building up of the church, by His preparing of Israel, and by His adjustment, His judging, of the nations.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>A sprout from the stump of Jesse indicates the restoring power of life in freshness&mdash;Isa. 11:1a; 7:14; 9:6; Exo. 13:4; Acts 3:19-21; Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:23; 5:26; 2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
	<li>A branch from the roots of Jesse indicates the hidden deepening power of life with growing power and fruit-bearing power&mdash;Isa. 11:1b; cf. Phil. 4:12-13; Col. 1:9-11; 2:7; Matt. 6:6; Psa. 91:1; Luke 8:11-15; John 15:5; Jer. 17:8.</li>
	<li>Christ as the sprout and the branch is full of the Spirit of Jehovah, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah; because this Spirit is of seven items, we may say that He is the sevenfold intensified Spirit, who is the presence of the Triune God in the church&mdash;Isa. 11:2; Rev. 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6; cf. Col. 2:2b-3; 1 Cor. 1:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The branching out of Jehovah is altogether a matter of the Spirit; Christ was born of the Spirit; that is, He was constituted of the Spirit as the divine essence&mdash;Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35.</li>
		<li>Moreover, He was baptized, anointed, with the Spirit&mdash;Matt. 3:16; Luke 4:18.</li>
		<li>The Spirit was with Him all the time and was one with Him&mdash;vv. 1, 14; 10:21; John 1:32; Matt. 12:28.</li>
		<li>He walked by the Spirit and lived a life in, with, by, and through the Spirit; in His human living the Spirit was manifested with all the attributes of wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah; no human being has ever feared God as much as Jesus did.</li>
		<li>The Spirit is the reality of Christ&mdash;John 14:16-20; 1 John 5:6b; 2 Cor. 3:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the sprout from the stump of Jesse and the branch from the roots of Jesse, Christ carries out the administration of Jehovah&mdash;Isa. 11:3-5.</li>
	<li>Wherever Christ as life grows in freshness and depth, there is the Spirit with His riches, there is the government of God in righteousness and justice, and there is the restoration of life.</li>
	<li>The administration of Jehovah brings in the restoration of life, where all have their nature changed through Christ as the indwelling, sevenfold intensified Spirit of life in His restoring, deepening, growing, and fruit-bearing power:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the age of restoration the wolf will dwell with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the kid, the cow and the bear will graze, the lion will eat straw like the ox, the nursing child will play by the cobra&rsquo;s hole, and the weaned child will stretch his hand upon the viper&rsquo;s den&mdash;vv. 6-9a.</li>
		<li>In the restoration Christ&rsquo;s restoring power will cause a change in the inward nature of all the creatures; thus, the situation among them will be pleasant, peaceful, and loving; the reason for this change is that the knowledge of Jehovah, the knowing of God, will fill the earth&mdash;Rom. 8:19-21; Isa. 11:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because the church life is a foretaste of the coming age, what will happen in Isaiah 11 should be among us today as a foretaste; among us there should be no &ldquo;wolves,&rdquo; &ldquo;leopards,&rdquo; &ldquo;bears,&rdquo; &ldquo;lions,&rdquo; and &ldquo;vipers&rdquo;&mdash;cf. Acts 20:29-30; Ezek. 34:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church life may be considered as a &ldquo;zoo&rdquo; of the restoration of life, where all have their nature changed through the Spirit and by Christ as the sprout and the branch&mdash;Heb. 6:5; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2.</li>
		<li>Through the divine transformation of our inner being, we are able to practice the Body life, where the knowing of God prevails, the peace of Christ arbitrates in our hearts, and all is pleasant, peaceful, and loving&mdash;Isa. 11:9; Col. 3:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Through our inner enjoyment of Christ, our growth in Christ, and our propagation of Christ, He becomes a banner to the peoples and a standard to the nations for a new revival&mdash;Isa. 11:10-16; Phil. 1:20; 2 Cor. 5:20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ as the banner is full of explanation, description, and instruction concerning the revival and restoration in the church&mdash;Isa. 11:10; cf. John 1:1, 4, 29, 32, 42, 51:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The divine glory, which is God Himself expressed, will be Christ&rsquo;s resting place&mdash;Isa. 11:10b.</li>
		<li>This indicates that the divine glory is one with Christ; it also implies Christ&rsquo;s divinity and indicates that Christ and God are one&mdash;John 17:5, 24; 10:30.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ as the standard to the nations is a great magnet to draw, attract, call, collect, and gather all the people of the earth to Himself&mdash;Isa. 11:12; John 12:31-32; 3:14-15; 8:28-30; 6:44; Jer. 31:3; S. S. 1:4a; Heb. 12:2a.</li>
	<li>Isaiah 11 couples Christ as the sprout and the branch (v. 1) with Christ as the banner and the standard (vv. 10, 12):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the church life, when Christ as the sprout among us grows bigger and bigger, this growing-up sprout becomes a banner, which describes, explains, designates, and even gives instructions to the peoples of the earth concerning what Christ is to God&rsquo;s people&mdash;cf. Exo. 17:15.</li>
		<li>The same Christ as a branch grows up to be a standard to call and gather the nations of the earth.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ as the banner to the peoples and the standard to the nations brings in the return of God&rsquo;s people in the one accord and the submission of the Gentiles through the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth&mdash;Isa. 11:10-16; Matt. 24:14; Rev. 6:2; cf. Acts 16:6-9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;In these days we need to pay our full attention to the all-inclusive Christ, who is the centrality and universality of the great wheel of the move of the Divine Trinity for the divine dispensing of Himself into His elect. In the church life for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, where the proper revival and restoration of life are taking place, Christ should be the sprout, the branch, the banner, and the standard. First, we ourselves must have a restoration of life. Then this will be propagated and will be designated by a banner, Christ. He will then be sought after by the nations, and He will become a standard to them. Hallelujah for Christ!&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Isaiah,</em> p. 275).</li>

<h1 class="title">Drawing Water with Rejoicing<br />
from the Springs of Salvation</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 12:1-6;<br />
Jer. 2:13; Exo. 17:6; Num. 20:8; John 4:10, 14b</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is to be the fountain, the source, of living waters to dispense Himself into His chosen people for their satisfaction and enjoyment&mdash;Jer. 2:13; Psa. 36:8-9; Isa. 12:1-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The goal of this enjoyment is to produce the church, God&rsquo;s counterpart, as God&rsquo;s increase, God&rsquo;s enlargement, to be God&rsquo;s fullness for His expression (John 3:29-30; Eph. 3:16-19, 21); this is the heart&rsquo;s desire, the good pleasure, of God in His economy (1:5, 9; 3:9-11).</li>
	<li>John 4:14b reveals a flowing Triune God&mdash;the Father is the fountain, the Son is the spring, and the Spirit is the flowing river, issuing in the totality of the eternal life, the New Jerusalem as the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to realize that whenever God&rsquo;s people are short of the Spirit of life as the water of life, they will have problems; when God&rsquo;s people have an abundance of the saving Spirit as the living water, their problems among themselves and with God are solved&mdash;Exo. 17:1-7; Num. 20:2-13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Through incarnation Christ came to earth as the rock; on the cross He was smitten by the authority of God&rsquo;s righteous law to accomplish God&rsquo;s redemption, and out of His pierced side flowed blood and water&mdash;Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4; John 19:34:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The blood for our judicial redemption saves us from the guilt of sin, and the water of life in resurrection for our organic salvation saves us from the power of sin&mdash;Gen. 2:21-22; Zech. 13:1; Psa. 36:8-9; Rev. 21:6; <em>Hymns,</em> #1058, stanza 1.</li>
		<li>His side was pierced, and living water flowed out for God&rsquo;s people to drink; this living water is the water of life in resurrection&mdash;the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the ultimate issue of the Triune God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Since Christ has been crucified and the Spirit has been given, there is no need for Christ to be crucified again, that is, no need to strike the rock again, that the living water may flow; to receive the living water from the crucified Christ, we need only to &ldquo;take the rod&rdquo; and &ldquo;speak to the rock&rdquo;&mdash;Num. 20:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To take the rod is to identify with Christ in His death and apply the death of Christ to ourselves and our situation.</li>
		<li>To speak to the rock is to speak a direct word to Christ as the smitten rock, asking Him to give us the Spirit of life (cf. John 4:10; Luke 11:13) based on the fact that the Spirit has already been given.</li>
		<li>If we apply the death of Christ to ourselves and ask Christ in faith to give us the Spirit, we will receive the living Spirit as the bountiful supply of life&mdash;Phil. 1:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In being angry with the people and in wrongly striking the rock twice, Moses failed to sanctify God; in being angry when God was not angry, Moses did not represent God rightly in His holy nature, and in striking the rock twice, he did not keep God&rsquo;s word in His economy&mdash;Num. 20:7-11.</li>
	<li>In all that we say and do concerning God&rsquo;s people, our attitude must be according to God&rsquo;s holy nature, and our actions must be according to His divine economy; this is to sanctify Him; otherwise, in our words and deeds we will rebel against Him and offend Him&mdash;vv. 12, 24; 27:14.</li>
	<li>We need to realize that what God&rsquo;s people need when they have problems is God&rsquo;s practical salvation&mdash;the processed Triune God Himself as the living water.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Therefore you will draw water with rejoicing / From the springs of salvation&rdquo;&mdash;Isa. 12:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to know the difference between the words <em>fountain</em> and <em>springs:</em>
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fountain is the source, the springs are the issue of the source, and the river is the flow.</li>
		<li>In the Bible a spring signifies life that flows out of God in resurrection into His chosen people&mdash;Exo. 15:27; Rev. 7:17; 21:6.</li>
		<li>The term <em>the springs of salvation</em> implies that salvation is the source:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The source of the springs of salvation is a fountain, and that fountain is salvation.</li>
			<li>The springs, which are Christ, issue out of the fountain and become the rivers, which are the Spirit&mdash;John 4:14b; 7:37-39.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The processed Triune God is the fountain, the springs, and the river of water of life; God as our salvation is the fountain, Christ is the springs of salvation for our experience and enjoyment, and the Spirit is the flow of this salvation within us.</li>
	<li>To receive the Lord as our salvation is to draw water from the springs of salvation; when this water enters into us, it permeates our entire being, it passes through our being, it is assimilated by us, and it even becomes us&mdash;Isa. 12:3; John 4:10, 14b.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As believers in Christ, we need to see how to draw water from the springs of salvation in order to drink and flow the water of life&mdash;Isa. 12:3-6; Psa. 46:4; John 7:37-39; Prov. 11:25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We have been positioned to drink one Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 12:13.</li>
	<li>To drink the water of life, there is the need of thirst&mdash;Exo. 17:3a; Psa. 42:1; John 7:37; Rev. 21:6.</li>
	<li>We need to come to the Lord&mdash;John 7:37; Rev. 22:17.</li>
	<li>We need to ask the Lord to give us the living water&mdash;John 4:10; 7:37; Rev. 22:17.</li>
	<li>We need to contact God the Spirit in our human spirit and in truthfulness&mdash;John 4:23-24.</li>
	<li>We need to believe into the Lord&mdash;7:38.</li>
	<li>We need to draw water with rejoicing from the springs of salvation by speaking to the Lord, by the Lord, for the Lord, in the Lord, and with the Lord&mdash;Isa. 12:3-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to practice speaking with the Lord constantly&mdash;Num. 20:8; Phil. 4:6-7, 12; cf. <em>Hymns,</em> #255.</li>
		<li>We need to confess our sins&mdash;John 4:15-18; 1 John 1:7, 9.</li>

<h1 class="title">The All-inclusive Christ<br />
Becoming Everything in God&rsquo;s Economy</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 22:20-25;<br />
Gal. 2:20; Col. 2:16-17; 3:10-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>It is crucial for us to see a vision concerning the all-inclusiveness of Christ, especially as He is revealed in Isaiah&mdash;4:2-6; 6:1-8; 7:14; 9:1-7; 12:2-3.</li>
<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is to work a wonderful person into our being; this person is the all-inclusive Christ, the One who is the reality of every positive thing in the universe&mdash;Eph. 3:17a; Gal. 4:19; Col. 2:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The all-inclusive Christ, with all that He has attained and obtained, is the One whom God desires to work into our being&mdash;3:10-11.</li>
	<li>God intends to work Christ into us so that we may have the full enjoyment of Him and so that He may have the Body of Christ brought forth through our personal experience and enjoyment of Christ&mdash;2:19; 3:15.</li>
	<li>The content of Isaiah 1 through 12 is the all-inclusive Christ&mdash;7:14; 9:6-7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Isaiah 13 through 23 covers the judgment of Jehovah upon the nations, including Jerusalem, and its issue; the key to this section is God&rsquo;s &ldquo;firing&rdquo; and Christ&rsquo;s replacing:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>What we have here is a picture showing us that in the entire universe everything in God&rsquo;s house and outside of God&rsquo;s house should be &ldquo;fired&rdquo; and replaced with Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His judgment God discharged, or &ldquo;fired,&rdquo; everyone and everything, including the kings of the nations, Shebna the steward, and all the bowls and jars in God&rsquo;s house&mdash;22:25; John 12:31; 16:11.</li>
		<li>When God created us, He &ldquo;hired&rdquo; us, and when He put us on the cross, crucifying us with Christ, He &ldquo;fired&rdquo; us&mdash;Gen. 1:26; 5:1-2; Gal. 2:20.</li>
		<li>After this firing there is the replacing; the replacement is Christ, Immanuel&mdash;Isa. 7:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Isaiah everything is &ldquo;fired,&rdquo; discharged by God, and then the discharging God comes in to replace everything with Christ; this is revealed in the Gospel of Mark, and this is Paul&rsquo;s concept in his Epistles&mdash;Mark 8:27&mdash;9:13; Gal. 2:20; Col. 2:16-17; 3:10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Throughout the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, there is a struggle between man and God concerning replacement&mdash;Gen. 3:1-13; Rev. 20:7-15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In his reaction to God, man tries to replace God, to put God aside, to expel God; and human government rebels against God and exalts man&mdash;Gen. 11:1-9.</li>
	<li>Satan was the first one to attempt to replace God, to expel God, and to take God&rsquo;s place in attempting to dethrone God&mdash;Ezek. 28:15-18; 1 John 3:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In his arrogance Satan declared five times, &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; indicating that his intention in his rebellion was to overthrow God&rsquo;s authority and to exalt himself to be equal with God&mdash;Isa. 14:12-14.</li>
		<li>Satan&rsquo;s ambition for position became the motivation of all the rebellions recorded in the Scriptures&mdash;cf. Gen. 11:4; Num. 12:1-2; 16:1-11; 2 Sam. 15:10-12; 2 Thes. 2:3-4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To be an antichrist is to be against Christ and to have something instead of Christ, something that replaces Christ; the principle of antichrist is to deny some aspect of what Christ is, such as His being the Eternal Father and the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 7; Isa. 9:6; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
	<li>Now Satan is behind man, trying to do away with God and expel God; even when man wants to do something for God, he does it by putting God aside&mdash;Matt. 4:1-11; 16:22-24; 1 Cor. 3:12-15; Num. 18:1.</li>
	<li>Because of man&rsquo;s reaction, God, who had &ldquo;hired&rdquo; everyone, eventually &ldquo;fired&rdquo; everyone so that He might replace everyone with Christ&mdash;Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; Col. 2:16-17; 3:10-11.</li>
	<li>God has replaced everything in His Old Testament economy with Christ; thus, the all-inclusive Christ as Immanuel replaces and becomes everything in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Matt. 17:3-5; Col. 2:16-17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Eliakim, the servant of Jehovah who replaced Shebna, is a type of the all-inclusive Christ as the Steward over God&rsquo;s house&mdash;Isa. 22:15-20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The fact that Eliakim is a type of Christ is proved by Revelation 3:7, where the Lord Jesus applies the word in Isaiah 22:22 to Himself.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s house is the divine household, including all the believers throughout the ages, over which Christ is the unique Steward, who takes care of God&rsquo;s household in every way&mdash;Gal. 6:10; Eph. 2:19; 1 Tim. 3:15.</li>
	<li>While Christ as God&rsquo;s Steward serves in God&rsquo;s house, He also governs, rules, and administrates God&rsquo;s children, who are under Christ&rsquo;s care.</li>
	<li>Christ is a Father to us, God&rsquo;s children; as the Father, He is the source and Supplier to support us in everything and in every way&mdash;Isa. 22:21, cf. 9:6.</li>
	<li>The all-inclusive Christ, as typified by Eliakim, is also the One upon whose shoulder the key of David is set&mdash;22:22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is the key of the treasury of the house of God, which is typified by the house of David, for the building up of the kingdom of God&mdash;39:2 and footnote; 2 Sam. 7:16; Rev. 3:7:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The church is both God&rsquo;s house and God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15; Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17.</li>
			<li>The key set on Christ&rsquo;s shoulder is the key for the keeping of all the treasures of the house of God, which are all the riches of Christ for our enjoyment&mdash;Eph. 3:8.</li>
			<li>Christ is the One who can open and shut the door to the treasury of God&rsquo;s riches, which are embodied in Him&mdash;Col. 2:9.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The key of David opens the whole universe for God&mdash;Isa. 22:22; Rev. 3:7:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>As the greater David, Christ has built up the house of God, the real temple, and He has set up the kingdom of God, the dominion in which He exercises full authority to represent God; therefore, He holds the key of David&mdash;Matt. 1:1; 12:3-8; 16:18-19.</li>
			<li>The fact that Christ has the key of David signifies that He is the center of God&rsquo;s economy; He is the One who expresses God and represents Him, the One who holds the key to open everything in God&rsquo;s dominion&mdash;Col. 1:15-18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ has been driven by God as a peg, or nail, into a sure place, which typifies the third heaven; Christ today is in the heavens as a peg driven into God&mdash;Isa. 22:23; cf. 2 Cor. 12:2b.</li>
	<li>Christ will become a throne of glory for His Father&rsquo;s house&mdash;Isa. 22:23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The glory here is the children of God, who are vessels hanging upon Christ as the peg&mdash;v. 24.</li>
		<li>With the glory there is a throne, and this throne is actually Christ Himself:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The throne signifies the administrative authority and the kingdom.</li>
			<li>Christ in His administrative authority is the throne that governs everything within the house of God&mdash;6:1; Jer. 17:12; Rev. 5:6; 22:1.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>All the riches of the bountiful supply for the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s children are hanging on Christ as the peg, the holder&mdash;Isa. 22:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The bowls and jars typify the different ways and means for us to partake of Christ in His riches.</li>
		<li>In the house of God all His children are vessels to contain His Spirit as water to quench people&rsquo;s thirst and His life as wine to cheer people unto rejoicing.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the New Testament Christ&rsquo;s terminating us and replacing us with Himself is altogether a matter of a grafted life&mdash;Rom. 11:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because Christ joined Himself to us, uniting Himself with us, when He died on the cross, we died with Him and were terminated&mdash;6:6; 2 Cor. 5:14.</li>
	<li>We are united with Christ, and in this union Christ replaces us; replacing demands union, whereas exchanging would annul union with Christ&mdash;John 15:4-5.</li>
	<li>Now in our organic union with Christ through faith in Him, He replaces us by living in us, with us, by us, and through us&mdash;v. 5; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:19-21a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to be infused, saturated, and permeated with the all-inclusive Christ until in our experience He is everything to us&mdash;Col. 2:16-17; 3:10-11.</li>
		<li>The all-inclusive Christ is in us, but we need to see Him, know Him, be filled with Him, and become absolutely one with Him&mdash;1:27; 3:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The real church life is a life in which all the saints are &ldquo;fired&rdquo; and replaced with Christ; this will make Christ everything in the church&mdash;Rom. 12:5; Col. 3:10-11.</li>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A crown is like a hat or turban, whereas the diadem is the headband as the most beautiful, glorious part of the crown&mdash;cf. Exo. 28:36-39; 29:6; Isa. 62:3.</li>
	<li>In Paul&rsquo;s experience, he had Christ as a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty&mdash;Phil. 1:20; 4:22.</li>

	<li>We need to continually behold the beauty of the Lord in the house of the Lord so that we may be transformed from glory to glory, beautified by the Lord, to become His beautiful bride and the house of His beauty with Him as our crown of glory and our diadem of beauty&mdash;Psa. 27:4; 2 Cor. 3:16, 18; Eph. 5:26-27; Isa. 60:7b, 9b, 13b, 19b.</li>
	<li>When we live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, Christ becomes our expression, our &ldquo;holy garments,&rdquo; to be our glory and our beauty&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a; 4:22; Exo. 28:2; Gal. 6:17-18:
		<ol class="decimal">

	</ol></li>
<li>Christ is a foundation, a tested stone, and a precious cornerstone for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;Isa. 28:16; 1 Pet. 2:6-7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ as the living stone (v. 4), the foundation stone (1 Cor. 3:11), the cornerstone (Eph. 2:20), and the topstone (Zech. 4:6-7) is constituting us with His stone nature to make us living stones (1 Pet. 2:5) for His spiritual house, His building; He is also a stumbling stone to the unbelieving religionists and a smiting stone to the nations (v. 8; Matt. 21:44; Dan. 2:34-35).</li>
	<li>On Christ as the unique foundation, God&rsquo;s building is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, and we are being built into a dwelling place of God in spirit&mdash;Matt. 16:16-18; 1 Cor. 3:11; Eph. 2:21-22.</li>
	<li>Christ is the tested stone; from the time that He became a man, He was tested every day of His earthly life, and He had no failure&mdash;John 19:4-5; Heb. 4:15-16; cf. 2 Cor. 6:1; Phil. 4:12-13.</li>
	<li>He who believes in this tried and trustworthy stone &ldquo;will not hasten away,&rdquo; &ldquo;shall not hasten with fear,&rdquo; &ldquo;will not hurry in panic&rdquo;&mdash;Isa. 28:16; 30:15a; John 16:33; Psa. 91:1; 31:20.</li>
	<li>We need to enjoy Christ as the chief cornerstone so that we may be joined together in Him; our Savior, Jesus, saves us and joins us into God&rsquo;s building&mdash;118:22-24; Acts 4:10-13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy Christ as the cornerstone, in His saving us, first makes us living stones for the building up of God&rsquo;s spiritual house (Matt. 16:16-18; John 1:42; 1 Pet. 2:2-6), and then, in the process of His transforming us (Rom. 12:2a; 2 Cor. 3:18), builds us up into a dwelling place of God (Eph. 2:19-22), that He may carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy for God&rsquo;s good pleasure (1:9; 3:9-11).</li>
		<li>Christ as the cornerstone is the unique salvation to sinners, and it is in His unique name under heaven, a name despised and rejected by the Jewish leaders but honored and exalted by God, that sinners must be saved not only from sin but also to participate in God&rsquo;s building&mdash;Acts 4:10-12; Phil. 2:9-11; Matt. 1:21; 21:42.</li>

		<li>Christ as our King is streams of water in a dry place:

<h1 class="title">The Example of Hezekiah&rsquo;s Person and Failure</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 36&mdash;39</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The first thirty-five chapters of Isaiah concern God&rsquo;s loving chastisement on His beloved Israel and His righteous judgment on the nations, in order that His elect might turn to Him so that the created things might be restored and the all-inclusive Christ might be brought in; at this point, everyone and everything have been discharged by God, and Christ, the only One who is qualified, has come:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In chapters 36 through 39 Isaiah provides an example in the person of Hezekiah, the king of Judah; Isaiah shows how a person such as Hezekiah, who was appointed a king in God&rsquo;s kingdom, who was godly, and who prayed and received miraculous answers from God, eventually became not a success but a failure because of his self-glory and self-interest; hence, he too was eventually discharged by God.</li>
	<li>We can learn valuable lessons from the example of Hezekiah; whereas we can learn certain positive things, we can also learn from his failure as a warning to us for our future as members of the Body of Christ; his example can help us to remain pure in our living and service to God for our entire life&mdash;cf. 1 Sam. 1:25; 2:11b-26; 3:9.</li>
	<li>King Hezekiah was a godly person with God-like behavior but not a man of God intrinsically and constitutionally (cf. 1 Tim. 6:11; 2 Tim. 3:17); he began his life with the Lord well but ended poorly (cf. Gal. 3:3-4; 5:7; Prov. 4:18).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Hezekiah, one of the best kings, did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, trusting in Him, clinging to Him, and keeping His commandments&mdash;2 Kings 18:1-8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Hezekiah removed the high places, broke down the pillars, cut down the Asherah, and broke in pieces the bronze serpent, to which the children of Israel had burned incense&mdash;v. 4.</li>
	<li>Hezekiah restored the house of Jehovah and removed the things related to idol worship&mdash;2 Chron. 29:3-36.</li>
	<li>Hezekiah recovered the Passover, which the people no longer kept&mdash;30:1&mdash;31:1.</li>
	<li>Hezekiah set the services of the priests and the Levites in order&mdash;31:2-21.</li>
	<li>Hezekiah built a defense against the invasion of the Assyrians&mdash;32:1-5.</li>
	<li>Hezekiah trusted in God and encouraged his people to do so&mdash;vv. 6-8.</li>
	<li>Jehovah was with Hezekiah, and everywhere he went, he prospered&mdash;2 Kings 18:7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Hezekiah sought after Jehovah concerning the enemy&rsquo;s attack&mdash;Isa. 36:1&mdash;37:38:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When Hezekiah heard about the situation, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah; this indicates that he was a godly person&mdash;37:1.</li>
	<li>Hezekiah went up to the house of Jehovah, spread before Jehovah the letter he had received, and prayed to Him concerning the enemy&rsquo;s further attack&mdash;vv. 14-20.</li>
	<li>Hezekiah trusted in Jehovah according to His answer to him and won the victory in Jehovah&rsquo;s fulfillment of His answer&mdash;vv. 21-38.</li>
	<li>Jehovah said that He would save Jerusalem not for Hezekiah&rsquo;s sake but for His own sake and for the sake of David; this word unveils that Hezekiah was not a weighty, valuable, or precious person in the sight of God&mdash;vv. 33-35.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Hezekiah sought after Jehovah for his health&mdash;38:1-22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In answering Hezekiah&rsquo;s prayer, the Lord referred to Himself as the &ldquo;God of David your father&rdquo; (v. 5); this indicates that Hezekiah had very little credit before Him.</li>
	<li>In his prayer Hezekiah said that he would walk &ldquo;deliberately [slowly, softly, and humbly, with much consideration] all my years&rdquo; (v. 15); however, instead of walking in a deliberate way, he walked in a hasty way (39:1-8).</li>
	<li>The fact that God extended Hezekiah&rsquo;s life by only fifteen years meant that he would live until the age of only fifty-four (2 Kings 18:2); this reveals that, in the sight of God, he was not a person who could be trusted to carry out God&rsquo;s purpose (Isa. 38:5); during his last fifteen years Hezekiah made a mistake that was so serious that it caused God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth to be lost (ch. 39).</li>
	<li>Hezekiah prayed a good prayer, but his prayer had the taste of selfishness (38:2-20); he asked Jehovah in a selfish way to put him among the living so that he could praise Him; this indicates that he was for God, but he was for God in a selfish way; this is what we taste in his prayer (vv. 18-19).</li>
	<li>Hezekiah was a godly man, but he was not a man of God, a God-man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Isaiah 39 shows Hezekiah&rsquo;s failure in the enjoyment of the peaceful situation and sound health:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Hezekiah&rsquo;s showing the visitors from Babylon his treasury, his whole armory, and everything in his dominion was a foolish act and a great mistake; the showing of these riches became a temptation to Babylon; a little over one hundred years later, the king of Babylon came and took away those riches (2 Kings 24&mdash;25):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Hezekiah did not consider his action carefully, nor did he pray about it; he did not take thought concerning what the king of Babylon might do.</li>
		<li>This shows that Hezekiah was hasty and not considerate or careful&mdash;Isa. 39:1-2.</li>
		<li>His making a show offended God, who hates man&rsquo;s pride&mdash;1 Pet. 5:5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We all need a secret, hidden life with the Lord, a life in which we experience the Lord secretly in the depths of our being&mdash;Psa. 42:7a; Matt. 6:3-4, 6.</li>
			<li>The Christian who parades all his spiritual life and virtues before men and who does not have anything in the depths of his being has no root; he will not be able to stand in the day of trial and temptation&mdash;13:6, 21; Isa. 37:31.</li>
			<li>Because Hezekiah exposed all that he had to the Babylonians, all his riches were carried away; this shows that the measure in which we display things to others will be the measure of our own loss; the measure in our life that we exhibit before others will be the measure we give up in ourselves.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Hezekiah failed concerning receiving gifts and concerning self-glorification; he was full of self and was not able to restrict the self.</li>
		<li>Although Hezekiah was a godly person who prayed and received miraculous answers from God, he eventually became a failure because of his self-glory and self-interest.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Hezekiah&rsquo;s selfishness is demonstrated by the way he responded to Isaiah&rsquo;s word to him in 39:5-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The kingdom of Judah was actually the kingdom of God on earth, and Hezekiah should not have regarded it as his own kingdom; for Hezekiah to lose his kingdom was a small thing, but for God to lose His kingdom was a great thing.</li>
		<li>Hezekiah had no thought for God and for God&rsquo;s kingdom, and he did not even care for his own children; he was altogether for himself.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The factors of Hezekiah&rsquo;s failure include:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Making a show of what he had, according to his flesh.</li>
		<li>Not being watchful.</li>
		<li>Not seeking after the Lord.</li>
		<li>Not praying.</li>
		<li>Not considering the issue, the result of his actions.</li>
		<li>Caring only for himself and not for God&rsquo;s kingdom on the earth.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;In light of this pattern, we need to spend some time with the Lord and ask ourselves what kind of person we would be. Would we be like Hezekiah, who was hasty and was so much for himself? As we consider this matter, we must learn to say, &lsquo;Lord, I would not be any kind of person; I would just be nothing. I would have You as my person and my life, as the One who lives in me that I may live You. If I want to be anything, I want to be a person like this.&rsquo; If we would all pray such a prayer, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would have a great revival&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Isaiah,</em> p. 128).</li>

		<li>God&rsquo;s response to David&rsquo;s intention to build Him a house to dwell in made Christ one with David and with David&rsquo;s seed&mdash;2 Sam. 7:1-16.</li>
		<li>David&rsquo;s house refers to Christ, David&rsquo;s kingdom refers to Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, and David&rsquo;s throne refers to Christ&rsquo;s throne; the kingdom of David is Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, and David and Christ have one throne&mdash;v. 16; Isa. 9:7; 16:5; Luke 1:32; Acts 2:29-31.</li>
		<li>The Gospels reveal that Christ is intimately related to David&mdash;Matt. 1:1; 12:1-4; 22:41-45; Luke 1:32.</li>

	<li>In Amos&rsquo;s prophecy God promised that in a certain day the kingdom of David and the family of David would be restored, and all the nations would be called by the name of Jehovah&mdash;Amos 9:11-12:

		<li>This prophecy indicates that Christ will come back to be the real David and will rebuild, restore, the kingdom of His forefather David for the restoration of the entire universe&mdash;Isa. 9:7; 16:5; Jer. 30:9.</li>

		<ol class="decimal">

			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the age of grace, the New Testament age, we can experience and enjoy Christ as the King reigning in the tent of David&mdash;John 3:3, 5; Col. 1:12-13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">

		<li>As those who are saved by grace, we are enjoying Christ in the miniature of the coming age of the kingdom&mdash;Eph. 2:8; Rom. 5:1-2; Phil. 4:23.</li>
		<li>The throne of grace is the source of the flowing grace; whenever we approach the throne of grace by turning to our spirit and calling on the name of the Lord, we should enthrone the Lord&mdash;Heb. 4:16; Rev. 22:1-2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As our King, Christ reigns not only in our hearts but also in the tent of David:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For Christ to reign in the tent of David means that He reigns in us with a kingdom&mdash;Luke 17:20-21.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s reigning in the tent of David signifies consolation, encouragement, and restoration&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 1:3-5.</li>
		<li>Isaiah 16:5 reveals that with Christ there is lovingkindness, truthfulness, faithfulness, justice, and righteousness:

		<li>The kingdom of God is an organism constituted with God&rsquo;s life as the realm of life for His ruling, in which He reigns by His life and expresses Himself as the Divine Trinity in the divine life&mdash;v. 5; 15:1-8, 16, 26.</li>
		<li>The kingdom of God has its reality, and this reality is the living of the divine life&mdash;Matt. 5:3, 8, 10, 20; 6:33; 7:21; Rom. 14:17.</li>
		<li>The kingdom of God as the realm of the divine life is a realm of the divine species&mdash;John 3:3, 5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God became man to enter into the human species, and man becomes God in life and nature but not in the Godhead to enter into the divine species&mdash;1:12-14; Rom. 8:3; 1:3-4.</li>
			<li>To enter into the divine realm, the realm of the divine species, we need to be born of God to have the divine life and nature&mdash;John 1:12-13.</li>
			<li>Our second birth caused us to enter into the kingdom of God to become the species of God; now we are God-men in the divine species, that is, in the kingdom of God&mdash;1 John 3:1-2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The kingdom of God as the realm of the divine life is a realm of light (John 1:4-5; 8:12), truth (v. 32; 14:6; 17:17; 18:37), grace (1:14, 16-17), glory (vv. 14, 18; 17:22-24), love (3:16; 13:1, 34-35; 14:21, 23; 15:9; 21:15-17), shepherding (10:10-11, 14-17; 21:15-17), and building (2:19-21; 14:2-3, 23).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The kingdom in which and with which Christ reigns in us today is the kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love&mdash;Col. 1:12-13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The kingdom of the Son is the authority of Christ&mdash;Rev. 11:15; 12:10.</li>
		<li>The Son of God is the embodiment and expression of the divine life; therefore, the kingdom of the Son is a realm of life&mdash;1 John 5:11-12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To be transferred into the kingdom of the Son of the Father&rsquo;s love is to be transferred into the Son, who is life to us&mdash;Col. 3:4.</li>
			<li>The Son in resurrection is now the life-giving Spirit, and He rules us in His resurrection life with His love&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 6:3-4; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The kingdom in which we find ourselves today is a realm full of life, light, and love&mdash;1 John 1:1-2, 5, 7; 4:8, 16.</li>
		<li>The Father has transferred us into a realm where we are ruled in love with life, not in fear; under the Lord&rsquo;s ruling and restriction, we have genuine freedom in love, with life, and under light&mdash;Col. 1:13; Matt. 7:13-14.</li>

		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By eating this all-inclusive bread, we are subdued and brought under the Lord&rsquo;s kingly rule&mdash;14:14-20; 15:32-37.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus is the kingdom of obedience; we need to take Him in by eating Him as bread so that He may be wrought into us&mdash;Phil. 2:8, 12.</li>
		<li>The more we eat Christ as the all-inclusive bread, the more the royal ingredients are constituted into us to become the ruling element within us and to cause us to become the kingdom as the increase of Christ in His administration; this will prepare the way for Christ to come again as the real David to reign in the tent of David in the coming age, the age of restoration&mdash;Dan. 2:34, 35b, 44-45; Isa. 16:5; Amos 9:11-12.</li>
