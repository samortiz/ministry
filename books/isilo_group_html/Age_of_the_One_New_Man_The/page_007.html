LIFE, CHRIST, THE CHURCH, AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1932 the denomination that I had left accepted my proposal to invite Brother Nee to come and preach in my hometown. Prior to that time, my contact with Brother Nee was only through correspondence. Now I would contact him face to face. Meanwhile, the Lord started working in my environment. Within a few days after Brother Nee&rsquo;s departure, a brother and I began to meet together. Thus, a church was raised up in my hometown, Chefoo. I did not struggle or endeavor to raise up the church; it was the Lord who added people to us. We began meeting on a Tuesday evening, but by the Lord&rsquo;s Day of the following week, eleven brothers, who had come out of eight different denominations, were breaking bread with us. Because my home was very small, only brothers came to the meeting; the sisters did not attend due to the inconvenience. We later found a bigger house and received the sisters. The next year our number increased to around eighty. We soon exceeded a hundred.</p>
<p>As a result of my fellowship with Brother Nee, I experienced a great turning point in my spiritual life. I turned from Bible knowledge to life, Christ, the church, and the Spirit. In August of 1933 the Lord urged me to give up my occupation and serve Him full time, but I lacked faith. The Lord, however, kept urging me to serve Him. Eventually, I had no choice but to drop my occupation. Afterward, I went to Shanghai to see Brother Nee, and he asked me to stay with him for a period of time, during which I received much help from him. He led me into life, into the subjective knowledge of Christ, into the church, and into the Spirit.</p>
<p>During the few months of my stay in Shanghai, Brother Nee gave messages in the big meetings. In addition, he would sometimes fellowship with the few of us who were there to receive his help. On one occasion he spoke concerning the first man, the first Adam, and the second man, the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45, 47). He also spoke concerning the grain of wheat becoming many grains (John 12:24) and concerning God&rsquo;s only begotten Son becoming God&rsquo;s Firstborn and concerning our becoming His many brothers (Rom. 8:29). It was a long fellowship. I later went back to my room and wrote down everything I had heard. It was a definite turning point in my knowledge concerning life, Christ, the church, and the Spirit. From that day onward, I saw how God in Christ came to be life to man, how God made us His many sons through His Son, how God caused His only begotten Son to become the Firstborn and caused us to become His many brothers, and how Christ as the grain of wheat became many grains for the producing of the Body of Christ, which is the church. In that transparent fellowship I received genuine help from Brother Nee to see a clear vision.</p>
<p>Through this turning point I understood that if we want to let God in Christ work Himself into us, we must see that Christ is the embodiment of God, &ldquo;for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&rdquo; (Col. 2:9). The Lord showed me the vision that we must eat Him and drink Him. This is not doctrine or knowledge. I had never heard this from others, nor had I read this in a book. I saw that the fruit of the tree of life was to be eaten (Gen. 2:9) and that the passover lamb and the unleavened bread were also to be eaten (Exo. 12&mdash;13:6). Furthermore, the Lord Jesus said that He is the bread of life and that he who eats Him shall live because of Him (John 6:48, 57). I saw clearly from the Bible that in order to let God in Christ work Himself into us, we must eat the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEVEL FOUR&mdash;<br />
KNOWING THAT THE SPIRIT PRODUCES<br />
THE BELIEVERS, THE CHURCH, THE BODY,<br />
AND THE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>The Lord also showed me that He is the Triune God. He is God, yet He became flesh (John 1:14) and passed through death and resurrection. In resurrection He brought the humanity, which He put on, into resurrection and uplifted it. In resurrection He also became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). This light has become clearer in me. I did not receive this light through the teaching or writings of others; it was given to me. This vision is that the Triune God became the life-giving Spirit; the Triune God put on humanity, passed through human living, entered into death on the cross, and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit. This all-inclusive Spirit, possessing divinity and humanity, produces the believers, the church, and the Body of Christ (12:13). Gradually, I also saw that it is this Spirit who produces the one new man (Eph. 2:15-18).</p>
<p>From my personal experience I saw what it is to be unsaved in Christianity. There are many such people today. We should not think that these people do not love Christianity. They love Christianity, but they are merely in religion. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I advanced; I was saved and loved to read the Bible. I loved the Bible so much that I wore out several copies of the Bible. However, when I met Brother Nee, I advanced further to a higher level of life, Christ, the church, and the Spirit. Because I turned to these four matters, I advanced yet further and saw that the Triune God became flesh, passed through human living, died, resurrected, and became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This Spirit produces genuine believers, the church, the Body of Christ, and the one new man. This is the highest level. The believers, the church, the Body of Christ, and the one new man are in the Spirit. In the Spirit the believers collectively become the church. The church living in this Spirit is the Body of Christ, and the Body living by Christ as its person is the one new man.</p>
<p>I have given you my testimony so that you may consider which level you are in. May we all reach the highest level to see the vision of the one new man so that the Lord can accomplish His work on earth through us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Age of the One New Man &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
