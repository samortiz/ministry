   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEVOTING TIME AND ENERGY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO COMPELLING OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we read the Gospel of Luke thoroughly, we will see that the age we are in today is the third stage of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This stage requires that we go out to the roads and the hedges to compel people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whomever we come across, we need to compel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to think of ways to compel our cousins, classmates, and colleagues until they believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think that this is a small matter; this is the principle of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the first portion of Luke 19, Zaccheus obtained salvation and was therefore joyful; however, if he were the evil slave who did not go out and do business, he would lose his reward when the Lord returns.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first part of Luke 19 is a story of salvation, whereas the second part is concerning the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all are saved and have received one mina.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether we will rule over ten cities or five cities in the future is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this stage the Lord is harsh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not say that it is easy to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is indeed not easy to go out and reap the harvest; however, those who preach the gospel in this stage will receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not easy to lead a person to salvation, because the world is attracting people and daily occupying them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must use all of our strength to compel others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition, we should never think that we will quickly lead people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we can all practice to preach the gospel in the way of compelling, each one of us will bring at least one person to salvation every year.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having a close relative who is not saved indicates that we have not devoted our time and energy to compelling people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Never look for an excuse and say that he is too superstitious to believe or that he is too hard.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should counter our excuses by compelling him to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes we can go and weep before our relative, at other times we can beg him, and still at other times we can go to his home and speak incessantly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No one can withstand a persistent person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as we are willing to bother him persistently, he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The gospel preaching in Taiwan must enter into this kind of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not sufficient for us only to invite people to come and hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must compel them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>EVERY HOME AND EVERY SAINT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN THE COMMUNITY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the parable in Luke 14, we are in the third stage of preaching the gospel; hence, we must compel people to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our preaching of the gospel should begin from the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every home should preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Currently we have small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When several families come together to have a small group meeting, they can bring unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should bring our gospel friends, relatives, and friends to the small group and preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After a period of time, when the small group is strong, we can preach the gospel by the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, we should promote preaching the gospel in the community.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not mean that the co-workers go and preach the gospel in the community, or that we invite people from different occupations to the meeting hall to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, the elders and co-workers should receive a burden to encourage the working saints to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can encourage the saints who are medical doctors, lawyers, legislators, nurses, or policemen to rise up and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The elders and co-workers need to kindle the spirit of the gospel in the saints and raise them up to preach the gospel to their colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For instance, a brother who is a medical doctor can open his home, not to invite his relatives but to invite his colleagues and their families to his home for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The elders or co-workers also can contact the brothers who are doctors and encourage them to speak the gospel in their private clinics or in the hospitals where they work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose a saint who is a legislator lives in housing appointed by the government, and his neighbors are all legislators.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The elders can encourage this saint to open his home to invite his neighbors to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this way we can gain some legislators and their families.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The same principle can be applied to saints in any occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The secret to promoting the gospel in the community lies in the promoters being burning, crazy, and going out to compel others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We shall compel the working saints by dragging them out one by one and bothering them until they cannot sleep peacefully unless they preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are burning, we will be able to kindle others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not easy to make others burning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, those, especially the full-timers, who go to compel others, must be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then they can go out and compel others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is our job; every one of us must be burning for the gospel and crazy for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since we are Christians and we cannot resign, we must go and compel others to receive the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is what the Lord has entrusted us with in the third stage of preaching the gospel.</S>
