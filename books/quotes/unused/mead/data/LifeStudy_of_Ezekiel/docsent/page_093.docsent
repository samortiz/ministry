   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Outer Temple</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we pass through the porch, we come to the outer temple.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The entrance to the outer temple measures ten cubits 41:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first entrance, that of the porch, measures fourteen cubits, but the second entrance to the outer court measures ten cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the further inward we progress, the more narrow the way becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we will see, the entrance into the inner temple is even narrower, measuring six cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to 41:2 there are five cubits on the sides of the doors.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are two posts measuring five cubits, indicating responsibility in testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The length of the outer temple is forty cubits, and the breadth is twenty cubits, making a total of eight hundred square cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The number eight hundred indicates one hundred times resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The numbers forty and twenty are multiples that can be factored by five.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Twenty is four times five, and forty is eight times five.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Five is composed of four the creature plus one the unique God and signifies man receiving God s grace to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The number eight signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, composed of eight times five, forty signifies the adding together of the man as God s creature and God in resurrection to produce something that has a perfect and complete form.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Entries</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The entry into the inner temple is six cubits wide 41:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we have seen, this shows us that the more inward we advance, the narrower the entry becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are outside the porch, we have no restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we come inside the porch, we have some restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This restriction is not very narrow, for it is still fourteen cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, when we pass from the porch to the outer temple, the entry is narrowed to ten cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Finally, when we proceed further and reach the inner temple, the entry is narrowed to six cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From our spiritual experience we know that the closer we are to the Lord, the more we are restricted by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are loose and careless, this is a sign that we are far off from the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The closer we are to the Lord, the more we will be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Inner Temple</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From the outer temple we go on to the inner temple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ezekiel 41:3 says, Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once again, two cubits, the measure of the post of the door, indicates testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 4 tells us that the inner temple is twenty cubits square.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Holy of Holies in the tabernacle was a square Exo 26 , and the Holy of Holies in the temple that was built in the good land was also a square 2 Chron 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The wall of the house Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>41:5 measures six cubits, signifying the humanity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The humanity of the Lord Jesus is the standing strength of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the tabernacle the acacia boards standing upright signified the humanity of the Lord Jesus Exo 26:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we need to see that the wall of the temple in Ezekiel also signifies the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a proper human being, the Lord Jesus is the standing and supporting wall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Twenty is composed of four times five.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Twenty cubits squared, the area of the inner temple, equals four hundred cubits, that is, one hundred times four.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Five times four twenty cubits becoming one hundred times four signifies God in the creature, with the creature as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we, the creatures who have received God s grace, are blended into one and are perfectly squared, becoming a unit of one hundred times four, God will have His abode among us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE SIDE CHAMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the south, the west, and the north sides of the temple are side chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These side chambers are of three stories, each having thirty side chambers, making a total of ninety side chambers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we consult the diagram on page 242, we will see that the wall of the temple is in three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first floor of the wall is six cubits wide, the second floor is five cubits wide, and the third floor is four cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because these are set one upon the other, a ledge of one cubit is created, and the beam of the side chambers is placed upon this ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The beam of the first story of the side chambers is placed upon the first ledge, and the beam of the second story of the side chambers is placed upon the second ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As the side chambers which surround the house increase in height, they also increase in breadth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The lowest story of the side chambers is four cubits wide, the second story of the side chambers is five cubits wide, and the third story of the side chambers is six cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, the breadth of the temple continues straight upward with no change.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the side chambers go higher, they also become broader.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This indicates that as we go higher with the Lord, we also become broader and richer in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we progress inward, we ascend higher, and as we ascend higher, we become broader.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because the side chambers at the first level are four cubits broad, they signify us as the creatures in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But as we become higher and broader, we, who are number four, become number five bearing some responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then as we go higher and become even broader, we become the number six, the proper man created by God on the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This indicates that we will be the same in measurement as the Lord Jesus, who is the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This reveals that merely to be a creature and merely to bear some responsibility are not sufficient; we need to become a proper man bearing the number six.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to Ezekiel 41:8 around the house there is an elevation which is a platform, or a base, on which the temple and all the side chambers are built.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This elevation is six cubits high, signifying once again the humanity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, the humanity of the Lord Jesus is the foundation, the base, and the wall.</S>
