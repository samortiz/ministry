   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NATURAL POWER AND THE LIFE OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we fully consecrate ourselves to God, we can believe that He has indeed prepared a body for us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We often think that it would have been great if we could have decided how our body was to be formed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our greatest hope is that our body would be free from so many natural defects and that it would have greater resistance so that we could enjoy a longer life without pain and illness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But God did not consult us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He knew what we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not blame our forefathers for their mistakes and sins; neither should we doubt God's love and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything which concerns us was decided before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has His good intention in giving us a body that is prone to being limited by pain and illness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His purpose is not for us to forsake this body or consider it a burden; instead, He wants us to lay hold of a new body by the indwelling Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He prepared our body for us, He knew all of its limitations and dangers, intending that we would seek a new body through our painful experiences, one which does not live by our natural strength but by the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus we can exchange our weakness for His strength and realize that even though our body has not become new, the life by which it lives is already new.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord loves to saturate our every nerve, blood vessel, and cell with His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He does not exchange our weak constitution for a strong one, nor does He simply impart a great amount of strength to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He desires to be the life of our body so that we may live by Him every moment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some may think that receiving the Lord Jesus as the life of our body means that God conducts a miracle to transfuse a great amount of strength into our body, with the result being that we will no longer suffer or become sick throughout our entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this was not the apostle's experience; he said, "For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His flesh was always weak, but the life of the Lord Jesus continuously flowed into him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He lived by the life of the Lord moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To receive the Lord Jesus as life for our body requires continued dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In ourselves we cannot deal with the environment for one moment, but through our dependence on the Lord, He will give us the strength we need moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what God meant when He spoke to Jeremiah: "But I will give your own life to you as spoil in all places where you may go" Jer 45:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not feel safe at all in our natural strength; instead, we commit ourselves to the Lord's life for every breath.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is the most security in this because He lives forever.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not have any reserve strength by which to act freely.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, every time we need strength, we must draw breath from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A moment's breath enables us a moment's living; nothing can be put in reserve.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a life completely joined to and dependent upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the secret of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we were able to live independently of the life-giving Lord, would we not be led to follow ourselves and lose our heart of dependence?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Would we not be like those of the world who waste their strength wantonly?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God wants us to have continuous needs and continuous dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as manna could be gathered only once daily, so must our body live by God hourly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way we do not limit our work by our natural strength, nor are we in perpetual anxiety over our body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If anything is God's will, we dare to obey even if it is risky according to man's wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is our strength; we should just wait for His commissioning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We ourselves have no strength to bear anything, but our eyes are upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have nothing to rely upon; we go on in victory only because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all are much too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not know how to stop trusting in our own strength or how to depend on Him without reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His strength can only be made manifest in our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we have nothing to depend upon referring to our attitude , the more His strength is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our strength can never co-work with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we want to help God's strength with our own, the result will be nothing but failure and shame.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the Lord requires dependence on Him, this kind of experience should be not only for those who are naturally weak but also for those who are naturally strong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some believers may think that they do not need to pursue this kind of experience until they begin to be weak, because their bodies are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a mistake; both our natural strength and natural weakness need God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whatever we receive in the old creation is not satisfactory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a believer has been deeply taught by God, he will lay aside his own strength to receive God's strength, even if his body is so strong that he seemingly has no need to seek for God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This does not mean that he exercises his will to choose to be weak; rather, it means that he does not believe in his strength, just as he does not believe in his ability.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This kind of consecration saves him from boasting according to his fleshly strength a common ill of the Lord's workers today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He dares not act beyond what the Lord has commanded.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is like those who are naturally weak, who without the Lord's strengthening dare not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He dares not overwork, carelessly eat, or freely expose himself to danger as those who are naturally weak dare not do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this kind of life it is crucial for the "self" to be restricted by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Otherwise, one is destined to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some believers would love to pursue this life, but they cannot completely stop their own work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They still disregard God's will and do things independently.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a result people may admire them for a short time, but the strength of their body will not sustain them for long.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God's life is not the servant of our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He will not supply strength for us to do work He has not authorized.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we work apart from Him, we will see God's life leak away and find ourselves once again bearing the work with our own poor body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In order to live by God, we must not do anything freely according to our own will; we must begin a work only after we definitely know that it is God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we are obedient we will see that His life is indeed for us; if not, He will never give us His strength in order for us to disobey Him.</S>
