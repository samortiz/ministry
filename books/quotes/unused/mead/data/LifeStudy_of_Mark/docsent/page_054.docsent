   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE NINETEEN THE MOVE OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOSPEL SERVICE 3 Scripture Reading: Mark 6:1-56</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we saw that in 6:1-6 the Slave-Savior was despised by the Nazarenes, and that in 6:7-13 He sent out the twelve to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We pointed out that just as the twelve preached, cast out demons, and anointed the sick, we today need to preach the gospel, present the truth in order to cast out demons, and minister life to others by anointing them with our testimonies of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall go on to consider 6:14-56, a portion of the Gospel of Mark that covers four matters: the martyrdom of the forerunner of the gospel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>14-29 , the feeding of the five thousand vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>30-44 , the Lord s walking on the sea vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>45-52 , and the Slave-Savior s healing everywhere vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>53-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE MARTYRDOM OF THE FORERUNNER</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not think that if we preach the gospel, present the truth, and minister life, we shall be welcomed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No, like John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus, and the disciples, we should expect to be rejected also.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the Lord was rejected by the Nazarenes, He sent out the twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then after the sending out of the twelve, John the Baptist, the forerunner of the gospel, was martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The martyrdom of John the Baptist indicates Satan s hatred, expressed by the darkness and injustice of the worldly people in power, toward the faithful forerunner of the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How did it come to pass that John the Baptist was executed?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This execution was carried out at the request of Herodias.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Mark 6:17-19 tells us that Herod had sent and seized John and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have the wife of your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And Herodias had it in for him and wanted to kill him, and could not.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John was murdered by the darkness of politics, by the darkness of those who were in power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With Herod there was no justice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Herod had committed fornication with Herodias, the wife of his brother, and this woman hated John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Herod knew that John was a righteous and holy man, and to a certain extent he had regard for him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Herod feared John, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And hearing him he was much perplexed, and heard him gladly v. 20 . It certainly was unjust for this righteous and holy man to be bound in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 21 says that an opportune day came, when Herod on his birthday made a banquet for his great men and the captains and leading men of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During this banquet, the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, pleasing Herod and his guests.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Drugged and deceived by her dancing, Herod said to her, Ask of me whatever you want, and I will give it to you v. 22 . Following the instructions of her mother, Herodias, she asked for the head of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, as a result of hatred, darkness, and the indulgence in lust, the righteous and holy forerunner of the gospel was put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a vivid picture of the rejection by the world of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 4:35 5:43 we have a picture of today s human society.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to this picture, society is full of rebellion, demons, unclean industry, disease, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 6:1-29 we see another kind of picture, a picture of rejection, injustice, and hatred toward the gospel and toward those who are handling the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since this is the situation, we should not expect to be welcomed by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should never expect to be honored or highly regarded.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There can be no such thing for those who serve the Lord in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are faithful to the Lord in His ministry, we shall be despised, and we shall suffer rejection, injustice, hatred, and perhaps even martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we should not be disappointed by the world s rejection and hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, we should be encouraged by it.</S>
