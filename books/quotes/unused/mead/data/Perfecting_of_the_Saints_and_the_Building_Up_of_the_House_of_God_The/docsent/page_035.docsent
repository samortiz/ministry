   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEEDING TO HAVE A VISION AND BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I would like to say something further.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I hope that this fellowship will be of help to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one who serves the Lord should be limited by what he has learned and by what he can do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When called by the Lord, Moses said, I am not a man of words,...for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue Exo 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God does not call us because we are capable, and He does not call us when we are capable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, the Lord calls us when we are not capable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord does not care whether we are capable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He asks only whether we are willing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The question is not whether we can do something but whether we have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The flame of fire burned within the thornbush 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not a matter of whether we can do something but of whether the Lord is burning within.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It does not depend on our ability but on whether we let the Lord burn us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Jeremiah was called by the Lord, he said that he was a youth and did not know how to speak Jer 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He admitted that he was a young person and doubted his ability to bear the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the Lord replied, Do not say, I am a youth; / For everywhere I send you, you shall go; / And everything I command you, you shall speak v. 7 . In other words, the ministry depended on the Lord, not on Jeremiah.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A believer who desires to receive God s calling must be delivered from himself and deny himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He must be delivered from his capability, from what he has learned, from what he can do, and from what he has done.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He must be delivered from these matters and deny them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord s commission does not depend on what a person is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person may say that he can serve in coordination because he is capable, spiritual, has a supply of life, and is eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He may also say that since he has learned all the matters related to service and coordination, and he is familiar with all the matters related to the building up of the church, he is full of confidence to go and do the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must realize that as long as we are the source, we are useless to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is an offense to the Lord to say that we cannot solve the problems in a place if we do not know what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord does not want us to solve people s problems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He never asks us to know the problems of others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not learn lessons in order to solve problems.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Lord sends us, He wants us to go with a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should know the vision, not others problems.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not need to know how to solve problems; we should know only how to pass on the vision that we have received to others and to speak of what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should never have the intention to help the saints solve their problems when we go out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Question: How can we be sure that the Lord has called us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Answer: We must always receive a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I went to Shanghai in 1946, there was already an unresolved problem there that began in 1942.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I was there, everyone who had a problem came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because I did not know the history of the problem, I had an advantage.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even though I was open in my attitude toward the saints, I could say that I did not understand the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whoever came to me could speak of his problems, but I did not hear anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I did not go to Shanghai to solve the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I did not understand the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I was not concerned with who was the source or whether it was a matter of someone being dishonest or crafty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I knew only that I went to Shanghai with the burden and the vision that God is the tree of life and that God desires to build up the church so that the church will rise up and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I did not know anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I did not want to know whether the saints had a problem with this or that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I knew only that God is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One day a brother told me that I was very clever because I pushed all the problems aside and did not touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He felt that I was carefree and unperturbed even though some problems were very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It seemed as if I did not have any problems and that I was transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I replied that I was not clever.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I was not sent by the Lord to Shanghai to take care of the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If God could not take care of the problems, how could I solve them?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I knew only that God sent me to help the saints see that He wants to be man s life and that man must live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I had to show the saints that God wants to build up His church in every locality so that the church will rise up to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the only thing that I knew.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I was not being clever.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I hope the brothers understand why I said this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should look at the situation in Shanghai between 1946 and 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we had pursued spirituality, we would eventually have had nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, if we had a vision and a commission, there would have been genuine spiritual building.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, we should not think that we are going out to supply the saints, solve their problems, and help them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This way will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instead, we need to receive a vision and a commission.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>BEING CARRIED BY THE COMMISSION BUT</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>NOT CARRYING THE COMMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The believers who know God realize that we do not carry the commission but that the commission carries us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We do not uphold the vision; the vision upholds us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we receive a vision, we will not be concerned about problems when we go forth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We will know only that God has entrusted us with a commission.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the greatest power.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is something that cannot be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We will be able to subdue others, but they will not be able to subdue us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is similar to what God said in Jeremiah 1:19: They will fight against you, but they will not prevail against you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must be broad when we touch different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is not that we are broad in ourselves; we need God to enlarge us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should not be trapped in certain feelings and seek spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Neither should we seek what kind of work we should do nor how to solve people s problems and meet their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord has shown us mercy and has opened our eyes to see a genuine vision.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The need abroad is not to supply individual needs or solve problems.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The great and genuine need is the need of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If the Lord has mercy on us, some of us will receive this vision, and the Lord s presence will be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should not be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must be persons who are broad because of the vision that we receive from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In order to receive a commission from the Lord, we must have faith in the spiritual supply, not only in material offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must believe in God s commission, believe that God is with us, believe in the vision God gives us, and believe that God will uphold us with His authority and His power.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must have faith in this.</S>
