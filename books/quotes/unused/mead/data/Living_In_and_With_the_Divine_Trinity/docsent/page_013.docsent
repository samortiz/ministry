   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 3:16 says that the Triune God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The world in this verse refers to mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God so loved mankind that He gave His only begotten Son for what purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was so that everyone who believes in the Son should have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God gave His Son, and we receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He loved mankind to such an extent that He gave His only begotten Son to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we receive eternal life by believing into His dear Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's giving His Son to us is His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Son is the embodiment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Father gave His Son to us, that was God giving Himself in His embodiment to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we receive His Son, His embodiment, we receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that eternal life is the Son, the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To receive eternal life is to receive the Son as the embodiment of the Triune God as a gift from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Triune God Sending His Son into the World,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Come of a Woman, That We Might Have</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Life and Live through Him</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First John 4:9 says that the Triune God sent His Son, the only begotten, into the world that we might have life and live through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This verse reveals the dispensing of the Triune God in the Son that we might have Him as life and live through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Galatians 4:4 says that the Triune God sent forth His Son, come of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God dispensed Himself into us as the gift of life through incarnation by being born into a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Triune God Sending His Own Son</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>in the Likeness of the Flesh of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 8:3 says that the Triune God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By sending His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, God came to dispense Himself into us as the gift of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The truth in Romans 8:3 can be seen in the type of the brass serpent in Numbers 21 referred to by the Lord Jesus in John 3:14: "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The brass serpent lifted up by Moses was in the likeness of a serpent, but within it there was not the poison of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but within Him there was no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By being lifted up on the cross as the brass serpent, Christ dealt with Satan, the old serpent John 12:31-33; Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that the serpentine nature within fallen man has been dealt with so that man might have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the way that the Triune God came to dispense Himself into His chosen people.</S>
