   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Firstly, in Romans 8 we find the answer to the question concerning where Christ is today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This chapter reveals that Christ is not only in the heavens but also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 34 says that Christ is at the right hand of God, whereas verse 10 reveals that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The very Christ who is seated in the third heaven is now living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, through Romans 8, we know where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we come to the question concerning the Me in John 15:5.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This involves the matter of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Most Christians know Christ merely according to an objective doctrine of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We definitely believe that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, God is three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a heavenly, divine, spiritual mystery which no one can explain adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not even have a thorough understanding of ourselves, much less of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Bible, the Triune God is not for us to analyze in a doctrinal way, but for the dispensing of Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Gospel of John reveals that God the Father is embodied in God the Son and is made known through the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 1:18 says, No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Philip asked the Lord Jesus to show the disciples the Father, the Lord was apparently surprised at such a question, and He said to him, Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord answered Philip in a mysterious way, telling him that as long as he had seen the Lord Himself, he had seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In John 14:10 the Lord went further: Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we see that the Father is embodied in the Son and seen in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John 14 reveals even more of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verses 16 and 17 the Lord Jesus speaks of another Comforter, the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we consider carefully verses 17 and 18, we see that the Spirit of reality is actually the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Spirit of reality is the very realization of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, in 1 Corinthians 15:45 Paul can say, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>. The last Adam, Jesus in the flesh, was transfigured through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, Now the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In experiencing the Triune God, we all need to know that God the Father is embodied in God the Son and that God the Son is realized as the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, Romans 8:2 speaks of the Spirit of life, who is Christ the Son of God realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because the Spirit is the realization of the Son, we get the Spirit whenever we call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If I call a certain brother by name, that brother responds because he, the person, is the reality of his name.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In like manner, when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we get the Spirit because the Spirit is the reality of the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may say, Lord Jesus, I believe in You, I receive You, and I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever you pray in this way, you receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We call on the name of Jesus, but we experience the Spirit as the realization of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that the life-giving Spirit is the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have seen that the Son is the embodiment of the Father and that the Spirit is the reality of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit today is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the totality of the wonderful Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is in our spirit for us to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This wonderful One is all we need: our life, our food, our living water, our light, our strength, our comfort, our holiness, our victory, our wisdom, our peace, our humility, our submission, our love, our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not a doctrine; neither is it a method nor a system.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is the enjoyment and experience of the living Triune God who dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After accomplishing creation and passing through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, this living One reaches us and even dwells within us, in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This living One, Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, is the very Me in whom we are to abide.</S>
