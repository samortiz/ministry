   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If a believer does not deal with the ground he gives to evil spirits, it will cause evil spirits to come in and stay.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although one may cast out the demons in himself or others in the name of the Lord, and although the demons may appear to have left, the person is not really free.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only certain manifestations of the demons are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They may change to another kind of manifestation, or they may stop the present manifestation for a while to avoid further attack.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the believer becomes less watchful, they will renew their manifestations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In short, if the ground is not dealt with, demons will still have something to hold onto.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The mind must receive the truth, and the will must vigorously, actively, and resolutely repudiate all the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, when a believer realizes that he is possessed through deception, he should seek for light, find out what ground he has surrendered, and remove the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Evil spirits come in through the ground given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we remove the ground, they will depart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, when a believer finds out that he has given ground to evil spirits in a particular matter, he should immediately reclaim the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since he became possessed by giving up his sovereignty and self-control and by falling into passivity, he should exercise his will vigorously and oppose the power of darkness through the power of God in the midst of various temptations and sufferings, rendering void the promises he gave to the evil spirits in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since passivity sets in gradually, it can only be removed gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The degree of passivity that the believer has discovered is the degree that he can reject.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the passivity has extended for a long period of time, the deliverance will also take a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is easy to go downhill, but it is hard to go uphill.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is easy to become passive, but it is hard to be free.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It requires the cooperation of the believer's whole being to reclaim the ground that he has surrendered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only then can he be set free.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A believer must pray and ask God to show him where he is being deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He must sincerely desire God to show him the true condition of his whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Generally speaking, whatever a believer fears to hear and makes him uneasy when it is mentioned is an area where he has given ground to evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the believer is afraid of dealing with something, he should deal with it, because nine times out of ten, evil spirits are occupying the ground behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A believer must receive light from God to examine his own sickness as well as other factors.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After he is clear about his sickness, he should reclaim his ground from evil spirits in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Light is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise, the believer will regard supernatural things as natural things and things that belong to evil spirits as things that belong to the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This enables evil spirits to attach themselves to the believer permanently without any hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Having this attitude is the same as saying "amen" to the demons.</S>
