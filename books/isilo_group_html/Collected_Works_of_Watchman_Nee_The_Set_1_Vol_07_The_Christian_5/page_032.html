If so, will they be changed the same way as that which is described in 1 Corinthians 15? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer: Maybe. There is no clear Scripture telling us that Enoch was changed. Elijah was taken up to heaven with his garment (see 2 Kings 2:13); it seems that he did not change either. When the Lord resurrected, did He not leave the linen in the tomb (John 20)? On the mount of transfiguration, they did not shine as the Lord did.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY OF MOSES</H2><P>Question: Will Moses have a body of resurrection? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer: No. He only has a "soulish body." In Luke 16 we see that after the body dies, one still has eyes (v. 23) and a tongue (v. 24). These are parts of the "soulish body." (The two preachers in Revelation 11 are two of the three. According to my knowledge, when the Lord was on earth, He raised up three persons from the dead. Do not these three die again later? Perhaps between resurrection and a changed body, there will still be a temporary separation [death]. Nevertheless, after 1 Corinthians 15:52, they will surely be in incorruption and immortality. But there are differences as to the other experiences.</P><P>Although Enoch and Elijah were taken up, they did not reach heaven (John 3:13). It is possible that their body was not totally a body of flesh. It may be that they only possessed the kind of body like the three who were resurrected by the Lord had.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 SAMUEL 20:25 AND 34</H2><P>Question: Is there a difference in time between 1 Samuel 20:25 and 34? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer: There is no difference in time. Both are in the past tense. Perhaps on the first day Jonathan stood, while on the second day, he sat at the table and hence "arose."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JUDGES 14:15 AND 17</H2><P>Question: How do you reconcile Judges 14:15 with verse 17?</P><P>Answer: Judges 14:15 should be "it came to pass on the fourth day." The internal proof is as follows: verse 14 says, "they could not in three days expound the riddle." Therefore, this must be the fourth day. Otherwise, verse 14 should say, "they could not in six days expound the riddle." The external proof is that both the Septuagint and the Syriac versions say "the fourth day." This is an error in the manuscript and does not affect the divine inspiration in any way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE VIRGIN IN ISAIAH 7:14</H2><P>Question: Some have said that "the virgin" in Isaiah 7:14 can be translated woman. Is this true? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer: Virgin in Hebrew is ha-almah. In the New Testament, the Greek word is parthenos. Isaiah was written in Hebrew. The root of this word came from alam, which means hidden, enclosed in the inner chamber; therefore, it means a virgin. This word is used in the Old Testament seven times (Gen. 24:43; Exo. 2:8; Psa. 68:25; Prov. 30:19; S.S. 1:3; 6:8; Isa. 7:14). Although there is another word more specific than this one, betulah, that word can mean either a young girl or a virgin. (The above is quoted from Wordsworth's Companion Bible.) In Hebrew the word ha refers to something unique and is a definite article. Therefore, Isaiah 7:14 clearly says that it is a virgin. Although the Jews consider Matthew wrong in translating Isaiah 7:14 to be parthenos, yet the Septuagint was translated by the Jews themselves, and the Greek Old Testament also translated this word as parthenos.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5) &nbsp; pg 32</div><br></body></html>
