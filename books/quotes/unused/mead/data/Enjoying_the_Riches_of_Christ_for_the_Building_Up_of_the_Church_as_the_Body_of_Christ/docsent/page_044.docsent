   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S PREDESTINATION FOR US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Recently some young people asked me to fellowship with them about marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I told them that thirty-five years ago I had many things to say about marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I could give thirty-six points on marriage, but I eventually found out that I was cheated and I was cheating others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not one of the points worked.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today I have nothing to say about marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do not know who is the best wife or husband for anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For over forty years in the church life I have seen all kind of marriages.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now I am perplexed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I do not know who is a good wife or a good husband for someone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thirty years ago in the Far East there was the custom, especially among the older ones, of recommending a young sister to a young brother or a young brother to a young sister.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we were concerned for a young brother, we recommended a sister to him because we thought she was the best one for him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes, however, a brother would not take our recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, he would be interested in a sister whom we considered to be peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He chose such a sister to be his wife, but actually it was not his choice; it was God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That peculiar sister was predestinated by God for him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes love blinds people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although we may warn a brother about a sister's peculiarities, he still may consider that he can bear them out of love for her.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may warn him not to have so much trust in himself, that he will be unable to bear such a one and will probably suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a brother may still marry the peculiar sister, but after only three days he may come back for fellowship with tears on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He may say that he prefers to have the windows of his house shut, but she insists to have them open, and he does not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, it is too late for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This sister is his choice and God's destiny for him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He must take God's choice for him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He must go, joyfully suffer, and die.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's grace is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He cannot bear it, but the grace can.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have seen many such cases.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Certain brothers reject all the better choices and take a peculiar one for their wife.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praise the Lord, that is the right one for them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a choice is not an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord predestinated such a sister for them before the foundation of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why today I have nothing to say about marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you feel that you must be married, go and do it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I do not know who is the best one for you, but the Lord knows.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We, the older ones who cared for the younger ones, all became disappointed, so we took our hands off their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not the good matchmakers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only the Lord knows who is a match.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No one should ever complain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must not blame our husband or our wife.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must not blame the situation or condition of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everything is of the Lord, and He knows everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if we make a mistake about marriage, that mistake is right.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, there are no mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must not regret anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to say, "Hallelujah, I made such a mistake, and I need such a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every mistake is wonderful."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some may say that I am now encouraging mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, if we make a mistake, it is because the Lord allows us to make that mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus said that even the hairs of our head are all numbered Matt 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If He has numbered our hairs, then there is nothing about us that is not under His care.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must never say we married the wrong wife.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can never have the wrong wife.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whosoever we marry is the right one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That one is exactly the one who we need.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord knows.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all have been predestinated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The things that have happened to us are beyond our dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many of us never dreamed that we would be where we are today.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not of us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may make a decision about what we will do next year, but only the Lord knows where we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are in the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may expect that the brothers coordinating with us will be nice, humble, not too slow nor too quick, just fitting our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, they may be just the opposite, and we will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As long as we feel that we are suffering, however, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The day we have no feeling of suffering will be the time we are thoroughly cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we still blame our wife or our coordinating brothers, this is proof that we need more cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we are thoroughly cooked, we will have no blame.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We will say, "Praise the Lord, the slow one is just as good as the quick one, and the quick one is just as good as the slow one.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No one is good, and no one is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everyone is exactly right."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This may prove that we have been thoroughly cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Young men and young women, on the one hand, your eyes must be open.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, there is not one woman on this earth who can be the best wife, and there is not one man on this earth who can be the best husband.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we are clear to such an extent, we can then shut our eyes and leave the matter of marriage to the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord really knows.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Paul says, "Our outer man is decaying" 2 Cor 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To decay, to be consumed, means to be exhausted, to be cut bit by bit, little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our outer man needs to be consumed for our inner man to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Praise the Lord, we all need marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This matter is sovereign of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we did not need marriage, many would give it up because it is truly a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A certain proverb says that a dumb person, after eating something bitter, suffers silently.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Everyone who marries is so; they must suffer without uttering anything.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the consuming.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The outer man is consumed, but the inner man is being renewed day by day.</S>
