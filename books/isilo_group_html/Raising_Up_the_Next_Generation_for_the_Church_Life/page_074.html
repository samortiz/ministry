<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE PRECIOUSNESS<br />
OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE</h2>
<p>In whatever a person does, the most important thing is to have a heart. Without a heart, a person will not want to do anything, and even if he does something, he will not be enthusiastic in doing it. Of course, this is also true with the young people&rsquo;s work. If you want to do this work, you must like the young people, care for them, and be concerned about their affairs. This may be considered the minimum &ldquo;capital&rdquo; required for the young people&rsquo;s work. If you have no interest in the young people and have no heart for them, doing the young people&rsquo;s work only out of reluctance, then it is useless.</p>
<p>Sometimes our heart may arise from our preference. When we like something, naturally we will have a heart to do it. Sometimes the heart we have may come from our knowledge. When we see the importance and value of a certain matter, we will spontaneously have a heart for it. According to my observation of the real situation among us concerning the young people&rsquo;s work, I see that some brothers and sisters are doing it out of their preference. Because they are naturally inclined to the young people and they enjoy contacting the young people, they come to do the young people&rsquo;s work. We cannot say that this is wrong. We have to admit that no matter how much grace we have received and how great the spirituality we possess, we are still human&mdash;we still have the part that is human. But here we have to say that it is not weighty enough to do the young people&rsquo;s work with such a heart. If we truly want to do the young people&rsquo;s work, and do it in a weighty manner, we must let God open our eyes to see the preciousness of the young people and their importance in God&rsquo;s hands. If we see this, we will appreciate this work, and spontaneously we will have a heart within us for it. (<em>How to Lead the Young People,</em> pp. 1-3)</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DISPENSATIONAL MOVE&mdash;&ldquo;NOW&rdquo; (REV. 12:10)</h2>
<p>When God changes His attitude toward a certain matter, He makes a dispensational move. Every dispensational move brings in God&rsquo;s new way. His most important dispensational move is in Revelation 12. He wants to end this age and bring in the age of the kingdom. His purpose is not general and ordinary. How can He bring this age to a close and bring in another? He must have His dispensational instrument. This is what God wants to do today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE MAN-CHILD</h2>
<p>The rapture of the man-child brings an end to the church age and introduces the kingdom age. The man-child enables God to move. If there is not a man-child and a rapture, God cannot make a dispensational move. We should never forget that God can be limited. He waits for man in all of His moves. God&rsquo;s binding in heaven is based on our binding on earth; God&rsquo;s loosing in heaven is based on our loosing on earth. Everything depends on the church.</p>
<p>It is God&rsquo;s desire that created beings would deal with fallen created beings. According to His purpose, the whole church should deal with Satan; however, the church has failed. Therefore, there is the need for the overcomers to rise up. God&rsquo;s purpose is fulfilled in the overcomers because they work with Him. We can see the principle of the overcomers throughout the Word of God. God always lays hold of a group of overcomers to make a dispensational move.</p>
<p>Are we at the end of the age? If we are, the kingdom will soon begin. If a dispensational move is near, then God needs an instrument. General work is no longer adequate. The children of God lack a vision; they do not see the seriousness and intensity of the situation. <em>Now</em> [in Revelation 12:10] is a matter of dispensation. Just being a good servant of the Lord is no longer good enough; this is not of great use to God. Please note that we are not saying that it is of no use. What are we doing to close this dispensation? What are we doing to bring in the next age? This is a special time, so there is the need of special Christians to do a special work.</p>
<p>Today God is waiting for the man-child. Only the rapture can precipitate the events in Revelation 12:10. God has an order, and He works according to that order. His eyes have left the church; they are now on the kingdom. An overcomer works according to the principle of the Body. The principle of the Body annuls sectarianism and individualism.</p>
<p>After the rapture the woman will be persecuted three and a half years. Many other of her children will go through the tribulation, but God will keep them. Being an overcomer is not primarily for escaping the tribulation. We need to see of what value the rapture is to the Lord, not to ourselves.</p>
<p>Of all the dispensational moves, the man-child is the greatest because it removes man&rsquo;s power and the devil&rsquo;s power, and it brings in the kingdom. We live in the most privileged time; we can do the most for God. <em>Light will show us the way, but strength and power will enable us to walk the road. A great price must be paid in order to be used now.</em> (<em>The Glorious Church,</em> pp. 153-154, 156-157)</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Raising Up the Next Generation for the Church Life &nbsp; pg 74</div><br></body></html>
