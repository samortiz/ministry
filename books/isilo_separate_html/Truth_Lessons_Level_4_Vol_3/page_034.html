THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; EXPERIENCE IN THE PROGRESSING STAGE OF GOD&rsquo;S FULL SALVATION</h2>
<p>From Level 2, volume 3 of <em>Truth Lessons</em> up to this lesson, we have gradually and carefully looked into the believers&rsquo; experience in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of transformation. This stage includes five major items: (1) experiencing and enjoying the processed Triune God in His Triune dispensing; (2) experiencing God&rsquo;s redemption continually; (3) enjoying the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation; (4) experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity corporately by entering into the kingdom of God, by living in the church, and by living in the Body of Christ; and (5) experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in other aspects. These five items constitute the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation. In this stage of transformation we are saved from the power of sin, the law of sin and of death, our old man, our flesh with its lusts, our self, our soul (natural life), our individualism, Satan, the world with its present age and its religious aspect, the law of letters with its ordinances, and the degradation of the church with all its mixtures. We are being saved from these things by the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us. The issue of our experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity brings us into two glorious results: first, becoming, as the bride, one with the Spirit; second, expecting and waiting for the Lord Jesus&rsquo; second coming to usher us into our future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Through experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the believers can have the highest standard of morality and virtues. By experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we are being established in every good work and word. Therefore, we need to have the habit of proving everything that we intend to do, to test everything, and then to hold fast to what is good. We also need to abstain from every kind of evil. The highest standard of morality and virtues is also seen in our endurance, which is the working of God&rsquo;s grace within us. We need to take account of what things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise. The six virtues of being true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely and well spoken of are the expression of a life that lives Christ; virtue and praise are the values of these six virtues and also the summing up of these six excellent virtues. These virtues will be an excellency in our behavior and will cause others to praise God and also to praise us.</p>
<p>In our enjoying of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we must learn to watch and pray so that we may not enter into temptation. The Lord reminds us to watch and pray because it is possible for us to be tempted in anything, at any place, and at any time. While living in this age, we need to take heed to ourselves lest perhaps our hearts be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day come upon us suddenly as a snare, for that day will come upon all those dwelling on the face of the earth. If we are watchful and praying at every time, we will prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and to stand before the Son of Man at His throne in the heavens. Furthermore, we need to watch and pray because we do not know the day and the hour of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. We must be ready to be raptured by being filled with the Holy Spirit all day long. We need to allow Him to saturate our entire being, spreading from within our spirit to reach and even to penetrate our soul. This is the life of a watchful person, a person who is ready for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
