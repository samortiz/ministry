But who is Christ and what is Christ? Christianity has tried to teach clearly about Christ. Today even a young believer can say something definite about Christ. Yet the more we study the Bible, the more we realize that it is difficult to completely comprehend who and what Christ is. It is easy to understand many other things, but it is very difficult to know Christ completely. Many in Christianity think that they know Christ in a complete way, but in actuality, there is no possibility to completely know Christ. He is too wonderful, too all-inclusive, too mysterious, and too marvelous.<p>Even we as men are mysterious. We have three lives: a physical life, a soulish life, and a spiritual life. Yet we do not know ourselves completely. How then can we completely comprehend Christ? We have a mind and emotion, but where is our mind, and where is our emotion? We have two hearts: a physical heart and a psychological heart. Medical doctors can touch our physical heart, but they cannot touch our psychological heart. We also have a soul and a spirit, but where is our soul, and where is our spirit? I know much about myself, but I am not completely clear about myself. I know that I have a mind, an emotion, and a will; I know that I have two hearts; I know that I have a soul and a spirit; and I know that I have a physical life, a soulish life, and a spiritual life. I have so many good things, but I am not so clear about all these things.<p>We are wonderful, but we are not as wonderful as Christ is. Christ is much bigger than we are; He is all-inclusive. Forty years ago I thought I was very clear about Christ, but today, if you ask me about Christ, I must confess that although I know much about Him, I am not very clear about Him. It is not possible to completely comprehend all the things concerning Christ. Therefore, I have no intention of trying to make you clear. Rather, I may puzzle you. If we are going to enjoy Christ, we have to be puzzled. When we are clear about Christ, we are finished with the enjoyment of Christ. Therefore, it is better not to be so clear.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING GOD AND THE IMAGE OF GOD</h2><p>John 1:1 says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; According to this verse, Christ is God. This point is very clear. Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is &#8220;the image of the invisible God.&#8221; Is Christ God or the image of God? Since God is invisible, how can He have an image? Does anything invisible have an image? To be sure, an image must be visible. As God, Christ is invisible, yet He is the image of the invisible God. This is a puzzle to our mind.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING THE FIRSTBORN OF ALL CREATION</h2><p>The latter part of Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. This indicates that He is one among the creatures. He is the Firstborn, the first item, of all creatures. Then verse 16 says that &#8220;in Him all things were created.&#8221; This means that He is also the Creator. Is Christ the Creator or a creature? To be sure, He is the Creator, but He is also an item of creation. I have composed several hymns on the subject of Christ being the creature as well as the Creator. Some have condemned me for teaching this, but I do not care whether or not they condemn me. Rather, I care for Colossians 1:15b, which says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. Our Lord Jesus Christ is too wonderful. He is not only the Creator, He is also the creature, and He is not only God, He is also man.<p>If we recognize that Christ is a man, we have to admit that He is a creature, because man is a creature. Christ partook of blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14), and blood and flesh are items of creation. The so-called systematic theology says that Christ is the Creator and admits that Christ became a man, but it is reluctant to admit that Christ is also a creature. However, as man is Christ not a creature? How could He have blood and flesh without becoming a creature? He is the Creator, yet one day He became a man, a creature with blood and flesh.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Enjoying the Riches of Christ for the Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
