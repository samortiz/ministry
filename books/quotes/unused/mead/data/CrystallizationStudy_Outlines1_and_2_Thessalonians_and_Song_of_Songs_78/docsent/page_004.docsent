   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The apostles were first tested and approved by God and then were entrusted by Him with the gospel; hence, their speaking, the preaching of the gospel, was not of themselves to please men but of God to please Him; God proved, examined, and tested their hearts continually v. 4; Psa 26:2; 139:23-24; 2 Cor 1:12; 6:6; 7:3.</S>
