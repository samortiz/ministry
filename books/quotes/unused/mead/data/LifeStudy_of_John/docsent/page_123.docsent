   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Eternal Purpose Plan</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Ephesians 3:10-11 we read of the eternal purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The words eternal purpose are a biblical term.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to modern English it should be eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In eternity past God made a plan for eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, this plan is an eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This plan is to have a large number of human beings regenerated with the divine life, become the Body of Christ, and express all the fullness of the Godhead embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the eternal plan, the plan that God made in eternity past for eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to know 1 Timothy 1:4 and Ephesians 3:10-11 very well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to become more familiar with these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To Express God the Father in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>through His Body, the Church</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This organism of the vine and the branches is the expression of God the Father in the Son through His Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this regard we need to consider Genesis 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have you ever thought that the church is found in Genesis 1:26?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The expression of the Father is also there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you were to ask how this can be so, I would reply that the expression is the image.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God created man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, man became the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then how about the church?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Please notice that the man mentioned in Genesis 1:26 is not an individual man but a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God did not create millions of men; He created a corporate man who includes millions of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Properly speaking, the man mentioned in Genesis 1:26 is mankind, and mankind is not individual but corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is a selected part of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may take as an illustration of this definition of the church the example of the wood used in making furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although I may collect much material for the purpose of making a table, eventually I shall select only the best part of this material to use in making the table.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the table is made, I will cast the leftovers aside.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I will keep and treasure only the table that I have made.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Mankind is the material that God is using to make the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not know how much of this material has been sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has selected only a part of mankind to be regenerated and become the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This corporate entity was sown as a seed in Genesis 1:26 and will be reaped as a harvest in Revelation 21 where we see the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the organism that expresses the divine image.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Genesis 1:26 we see a corporate man made in God s image; in Revelation 21 we see the New Jerusalem, the corporate expression of the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The seed is sown in Genesis, the harvest is reaped in Revelation 21, and the crop is here on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>B. The Vine, God the Son 1.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Center of God s Economy</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As the vine, the Son is the center of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God the Son is the center of God s business, of God s operation, of God s enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has an operation in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This operation is His divine business.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Son as the vine is the very center of this enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Embodiment and the Manifestation</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>of the Godhead</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This vine is the embodiment and manifestation of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Colossians 2:9 says that in the Son the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John 1:18 says, No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Colossians 2:9 we see the Son as the embodiment of the Godhead, and in John 1:18 we see Him as the declaration, the manifestation, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So the very Son of God, who is God s universal vine, is God s embodiment and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>An Organism Full of Life, like the Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This vine is an organism full of life, like the tree of life Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not an organization without life, like the tower of Babel Gen 11:4, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The tree of life is an organism, and the tower of Babel is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Which do you prefer to have the tree of life or the tower of Babel?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The tower of Babel was great and high, but the tree of life was probably the same height as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the tree of life had been too high, it would have been awkward for people to reach it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to John 6 the people tried to force Christ to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that they wanted to make Him a tower.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But He preferred to be the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that He wanted to be the tree of life.</S>
