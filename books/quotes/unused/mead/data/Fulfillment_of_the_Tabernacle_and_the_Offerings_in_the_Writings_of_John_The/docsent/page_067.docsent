   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE SIGNS IN JOHN SIX 1 Scripture Reading: John 6:1-21, 26-69</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It may seem that the record in chapter six of John is easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Actually, this is the most difficult chapter in the Gospel of John from which to obtain the extract.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In contrast, it was easy for us to have the extract in chapter one, for we could easily see the six main signs: the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, as I was considering chapter six, it seemed to me that there were hardly any signs in this chapter, and if there are no signs, there is no extract, since the signs are the basis for the extract.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Under the inspiration of the Spirit, John used the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand as a basis for saying certain things that are different from what is recorded in the synoptic Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matthew, Mark, and Luke all record the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand, but none of them says anything concerning the bread of life, the bread that came down from heaven to give life to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John is unique in taking the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand as a basis for speaking concerning Christ as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, there can be no doubt that the feeding of the five thousand was an event of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>SOME BASIC THOUGHTS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to have the extract of John 6 we need a basic understanding of certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, John told us that in writing his Gospel he selected certain things done by the Lord Jesus and used them in composing this book.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name" 20:30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is quite meaningful, then, that John inserted chapter six after the five preceding chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Sketch of This Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen that chapter one has six signs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This chapter is a sketch of the entire Gospel of John and reaches from eternity past 1:1 to eternity future 1:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Between eternity past and eternity future there is the bridge of time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On this bridge a number of things are happening for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Principle and Goal of Life</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The two signs in chapter two the changing of water into wine and the raising up of the destroyed temple give us the principle of life and show us the goal, or purpose, of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The principle of life is to change death into life, and the goal of life is to produce the dwelling place of God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Two Cases</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapters three and four John presents two very interesting cases.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first, in chapter three, is that of a learned Jewish gentleman.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second, in chapter four, is that of an immoral Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With the case of Nicodemus we see that even a good man has the serpentine nature and needs to be regenerated to have a new life by a new birth in order to become a new man as part of the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This thought is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the case of the Samaritan woman we see someone who needs Christ to be the source of her life and the means for her to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both for her living and for her worship of God, the Samaritan woman needed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the fountain of living water, and He is also the truth, the divine reality, for the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In these two chapters with the cases of Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman we can see what people need today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>People need a new birth with a new life in order to be a new man so that they may become part of Christ's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even such a new person, a regenerated person, still needs Christ as the source of life, as the fountain of living water, and also as the means, the reality, for the worship of God.</S>
