   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to the Corinthian Believers</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 15:1 and 2 Paul says, Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you as the gospel, unless you believed in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The gospel here is the full gospel, including the teachings concerning Christ and the church, as fully disclosed in the book of Romans 1:1; 16:25 .</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have been saved by Christ s death, but we are still being saved in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Gospel Delivered to Them</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verses 3 and 4 Paul goes on to say, For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ s death for our sin, His burial for our termination, and His resurrection for our germination with life, according to the prophecies of the Old Testament Isa 53:5-8, 10-12; Psa 22:14-18; Dan 9:26; Isa 53:9; Psa 16:9-10; Hosea 6:2 , are the basic items among the first things of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The last of these items is the most vital in the gospel, for it imparts life to us that we may live Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Greek word rendered seen also means appeared to.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The earlier apostles and disciples were eyewitnesses of Christ s resurrection Acts 1:22 , and their preaching stressed their testimony to this Acts 2:32; 4:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They bore witness to the resurrected Christ not only by their teaching, but also by their living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They lived with Him by His living in resurrection John 14:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verses 8 and 9 Paul refers to himself: And last of all He was seen by me also, even as to one untimely born.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One who persecuted Christ and the church became an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 10 Paul continues, But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is by this grace that Saul of Tarsus, the foremost of sinners 1 Tim 1:15-16 , became the foremost apostle, laboring more abundantly than all the other apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His ministry and living by this grace are an undeniable testimony to Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not I, but the grace of God equals not I, but Christ in Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The grace that motivates the apostle and operates in him is not some matter or some thing, but a living Person, the resurrected Christ, the embodiment of God the Father becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who dwells in him as his everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 10 grace is the Christ who is in resurrection and who is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By this grace Paul could be what he was and labor more than all the other apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we compare 1 Corinthians 15:10 with Galatians 2:20, we see that grace is not a thing, but a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the disciples and apostles who saw the resurrected Christ not only saw Him objectively, but experienced Him subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through their seeing of Christ, He entered into them and became the subjective One in them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the day of Pentecost came, this was the reason they were living, energetic, and operative.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The resurrected Christ was in them.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Throughout the centuries, all the living servants of God have had this resurrected Christ living in them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I can also testify that He lives in me, enabling me to do what I never could do in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hallelujah, the Lord Jesus lives!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How do we know He lives?</S>
