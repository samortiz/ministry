   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"In distressful times" in the original text can also be translated "in short times."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This probably means the seven weeks because it is shorter than sixty-two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The rebuilding of Jerusalem is during the seven weeks, that is, forty-nine years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The original text only states seven; it does not specify whether it is days or years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, all Bible expositors believe that it refers to years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After the wall is built, sixty-two more weeks will pass before the anointed One will come.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here, we do not need to study exactly when the seventy weeks begin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One thing is certain: we know the anointed One will come after sixty-nine weeks seven weeks plus sixty-two weeks .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild the city until the time of the anointed One's coming, there is a total of four hundred eighty-three years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now sixty-nine weeks have already passed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The anointed One Christ has already come.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only one week is left.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As soon as this comes to pass, the children of Israel will receive her full blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, within seven years after Christ's death, was there any day in which we could say that Israel and Jerusalem made an end of sins?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No, absolutely not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is it not true that since Christ the anointed One came until now, more than nineteen hundred years have passed?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, it is obvious that the seventieth week did not come after the sixty-ninth week.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why was this week not fulfilled, and why has Israel not received her blessing yet?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because, "after the sixty-two weeks" as mentioned above, which, together with the first seven weeks, makes up sixty-nine weeks "Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing" Dan 9:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ died; Israel did not get the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They did not receive Him with a willing heart; rather, they treated Him with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, punishment came: "The people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary" Dan 9:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Jews killed the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They willfully let the blood be upon them and their children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, God punished them according to their own word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He forsook them temporarily and graced the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the fullness of the Gentiles comes in, He will grace Israel again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By then, the last seven will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As soon as the last week is completed, God will save Israel according to His promise in verse 24.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary" Dan 9:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone knows that this refers to the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After Christ's death, the Jews were punished by God greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Romans came and destroyed Jerusalem and its sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since the people here refers to the Romans, some think that the "prince" here is the Roman prince Titus who led the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, there are many reasons against this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why did it not say that the prince who will come will destroy, but rather "the people of the prince"?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although the work of the prince must be done through his people, why does it mention only the people here and not the prince directly?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the Holy Spirit was speaking of two things simultaneously, the prince and the people of the prince, and was emphasizing the people, does this not indicate that the people here are the people of the coming prince?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This prince does not refer to Titus, and the people that came and destroyed Jerusalem, doctrinally speaking, are the people of the coming prince.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This prince is the one Daniel prophesied of as the great man on the earth who shall rise up in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This man is Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we translate this according to the original text, we shall see that the prince refers to Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"The people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This prince is the one who shall come; he is Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"And the end of it will be with a flood, and even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined" v. 26 . "The end" here does not mean the end of the city because in the original text the pronoun does not match this interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not the end of the sanctuary because it could not mention the sanctuary only and leave out the city.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A brother who knows Hebrew says that this phrase modifies "who will come."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, this was not fulfilled at Titus's time but will be fulfilled in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary, and his end shall be with a flood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We know this "superman" is about to come, and the world will have no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But thank the Lord, we shall be taken away before Antichrist comes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week; and in the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease" v. 27 . The previous text tells how the Antichrist shall rebel; here it continues to speak of his acts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The last week is divided into two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the beginning of this week, he shall confirm a covenant with many.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not the old covenant, the only and unique covenant, that God made with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This fact is indicated by the article in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before "many," there is an article "the," which indicates a special people, that is, the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, this covenant is the political treaty that the Jews will make with Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The period is seven years, but he will break the treaty at the half of the seven.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the meaning of "to change the times and the law" in 7:25.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here we can see the similarities between the prince and the little horn in chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He will break the treaty at the half of the week; there still will be a half of the week three and a half years remaining in his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The time that the little horn wears out the saints is also for the duration of three and a half years 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In these three and a half years, the little horn shall change times and laws.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is also in this period of time that he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Up to now the Jews have had no sacrifice nor oblation, but in the future, they will be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now we see that the Jews have returned.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have heard that they are going to restore these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The last days are really near.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Why does he cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is because Antichrist will blaspheme God at this time chapter seven .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The sacrifice and the oblation are offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is why he forbids it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>"For the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation" 9:27, KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The overspreading of abomination is the idol.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In God's temple, the ark was covered by the wings of the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Antichrist will sit in the temple of God and will call himself God 2 Thes 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He will have the overspreading of abomination.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Because of this worshipping of the idol, God will allow the destruction to last for three and a half years, until the end of the seventy weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>"And that determined shall be poured upon the desolate" Dan 9:27, KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The desolate is Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When the seventy weeks are about over and all nations will battle against Jerusalem, the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations for her Zech 14:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then the word in Daniel 9:24 will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>From this, we can see how Satan uses man.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Antichrist is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Because he obeys Satan, he receives the evil power to dominate over the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Although Antichrist has not yet come, in A.D. 70 the Romans had already become his people; they had received his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The chaos among the present nations is manipulated by Satan behind the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>At times, he empowers this one, at times he empowers that one, making those on the political stage his puppets to disturb the world.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The last person he will use will be Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Now we see the spirit of the antichrist working everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The most prominent feature of Antichrist is lawlessness 2 Thes 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Those who have their eyes open to the world situation will know that lawlessness is very prevalent.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Nearly everyone around us is lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Lawless ones exist in all walks of life and comprise the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Now it seems that everyone is only a thin line away from lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Once the restraint is taken away, nothing can be done anymore to help the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>At this hour we who have believed in the Lord and who are purchased by the Lord's blood should stand in one accord in spirit, in prayer, and in will to resist Satan and his works.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>May God teach His church to clearly know the triumph of the cross so that she can have the experience of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The world ripens in sin; it will soon be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The church of Christ must ripen in life that she may be raptured.</S>
