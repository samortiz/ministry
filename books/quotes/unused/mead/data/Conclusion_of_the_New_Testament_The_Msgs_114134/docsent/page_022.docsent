   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>as the Brass Serpent on the Cross,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>to Have an Organic Union with Him</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The believers have believed into the Son of God, who has the eternal life, and into the Son of Man, who was lifted up as the brass serpent on the cross, to have an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 3:16 says, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse speaks of believing in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Greek preposition for in here actually means into and signifies union with Christ by believing into Him.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The testimony of God is not only that Jesus is His Son but also that He gives us the eternal life which is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Son of God is the means for God to give us His eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because the life is in the Son John 1:4 and the Son is the life John 11:25; 14:6; Col 3:4 , the Son and the life are one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have the Son of God, we have eternal life, because eternal life is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, eternal life is the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, when we receive the Son of God by believing into Him, we have the eternal life that is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John 3:14 and 15 say, As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These verses speak of having eternal life, the divine life, the uncreated life of God, by believing into the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here the Lord Jesus applies to Himself the type of the brass serpent Num 21:4-9 , showing that when He was in the flesh, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 , which likeness was the form of the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It had the form of the serpent but not the poison.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He had no participation in the sin of the flesh 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When in the flesh He, the Son of Man, was lifted up on the cross, He dealt with Satan, the old serpent John 12:31-33; Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we may have eternal life by believing into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Greek word rendered that at the beginning of John 3:15 is better translated so that or in order that.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This indicates the goal of the lifting up of the Son of Man.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that by believing into Him we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through, accomplished, obtained, and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, by believing into Christ we have an organic union with Him and thereby become one spirit with Him 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
