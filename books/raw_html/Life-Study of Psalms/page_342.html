<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CONSUMMATE PRAISE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Psa. 146&#151;150</H1><P>In this message we will cover the last five psalms, Psalms 146 through 150. Because each of these psalms begins and ends with the word "Hallelujah," these five psalms are called Hallelujah psalms. The Septuagint says that Psalms 146 to 149 were written by Haggai and Zechariah after their return from captivity. The return of God's people from captivity was a great release and restoration.</P><P>Some expositors say that the five books of the Psalms correspond to the five books of the law written by Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Other expositors say that the Psalms are an abstract of the entire Bible. Certain expositors exalt Psalms 146 through 150. However, these psalms reveal very little concerning God's economy and dispensing, for when they were written the "spiritual civilization" was still quite primitive. Since the book of Psalms was written, the divine revelation in the Scriptures has progressed very much. For this reason, Psalms 146 through 150 cannot compare with the book of Ephesians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THIS CONSUMMATE PRAISING CORRESPONDING<br>WITH THAT AT THE END OF REVELATION</H2><P>I have entitled this message on Psalms 146 through 150 "The Consummate Praise." This consummate praise corresponds with that at the end of Revelation. Revelation 19:1 says, "Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the power are of our God." Here God is praised for His salvation, glory, and power. Verse 6 says, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. PRAISING JEHOVAH FOR HIS REIGNING FROM ZION</H2><P>Psalm 146 is on praising Jehovah for His reigning from Zion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. He Being the Help of His Saints</H2><P>Verses 3 through 5 are a praise to Jehovah for His being the help of His saints. In verses 3 and 4 we have the background of the psalm. Verse 3 says, "Do not trust in princes,/In a son of man, with whom there is no salvation." Haggai and Zechariah, who were born in captivity, saw the kings of Babylon and Persia, and this was why they said that we should not trust in princes. Verse 4, referring to a son of man, says, "His breath goes forth; he returns to the earth;/On that day his plans perish." The plans of the Babylonian and Persian kings perished. Verse 5 continues, "Blessed is the man whose help is the God of Jacob,/Whose hope is in Jehovah his God." The writer knew that the returned captives were the blessed ones.</P>
