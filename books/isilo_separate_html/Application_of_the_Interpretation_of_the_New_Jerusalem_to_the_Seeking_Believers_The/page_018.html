As we have seen, the main structure of the city is of three factors: gold as the base, pearls as the gates, and precious stones as the wall. There are also three furnishings in the holy city. The throne refers to God the Father. The temple refers to Christ. In the New Testament, Christ is called the temple of God (Rev. 21:22; John 2:19-21). We serving ones are all dwelling in Christ as God&#8217;s temple. We dwell here as the many sons with the firstborn Son. The Father is the King, and all the sons are the co-kings. The temple is the palace. Also, God the Son is the lamp with the Father in Him as the shining light. This lamp is not an electrical lamp but an oil lamp. The oil signifies the Spirit, so the hidden One of the Trinity here is the Spirit. God is the shining light, Christ is the container of God as the lamp, and within the lamp is the oil, the Spirit.<p>The three factors of the structure and the three furnishings of the city signify the Triune God. Now we come to the third group of three signifying the Triune God. This group is concerning the supply of the city. The street as the base signifies the Father, the river flowing with the water of life signifies the Spirit, and the tree of life signifies the Son, Christ. Thus, the basic structure of the holy city is the Divine Trinity, its furnishings are the Divine Trinity, and its supply is the Divine Trinity.<p>In every chapter of the book of Ephesians we can see the three of the Divine Trinity. For instance, in chapter one there are the Father&#8217;s blessing, Christ&#8217;s blessing, and the Spirit&#8217;s blessing (vv. 3-14). Then in chapter four there are the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father as the intrinsic essence of the Body (vv. 4-6). The three of the Divine Trinity are the very intrinsic essence for the constitution of the Body of Christ. The entire divine revelation in the holy Word shows how God in His Divine Trinity dispenses Himself into His chosen people. In this last and greatest sign in the Scriptures, the sign of the New Jerusalem, its structure, furnishings, and supply are the Triune God.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
