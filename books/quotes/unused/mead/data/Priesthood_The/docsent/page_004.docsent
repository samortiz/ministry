   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Moses</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then we come to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When he was in the wilderness, he was in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After he was called by God to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt, he was at least in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He helped them pass through the Red Sea and eventually was brought to Mount Sinai where he stayed for forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No doubt that was the real Holy of Holies to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he came down from the mountain, the people saw the shekinah glory of God on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All Israel</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the time of the Passover, all the children of Israel offered the lamb without the help of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was because they all were priests.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every house was a part of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the people offered the same sacrifice to God at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not one family had a special priest to offer the Passover lamb for them, because all of them were priests.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When they were brought out of Egypt to Mount Sinai, the Lord told them that He would make them a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They all were to be His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All were to be in His presence, to be saturated with Him, and to become His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the real priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I must say again that the priesthood is not to do something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a group of people filled, saturated, and permeated with God, in order that God might flow out of them as His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the people of Israel also failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then God turned to the tribe of Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They became the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, the Levites did not do much for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They spent their time in His presence to be dealt with by Him and to be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will see more of this in the following chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the priesthood, they continually enjoyed the Lord and bore Him as their testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot leave the Old Testament without considering the Psalmists.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we read their writings, we must admit that they were real priests.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their writings indicate that they spent most of their time in God s presence to be filled and permeated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we come to the New Testament, we realize that the Apostles were priests.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They were continually opening themselves to the Lord to be saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, they were a real corporate expression of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In fact, according to the New Testament, a believer must be this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter and John especially emphasized this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Peter was the first apostle, and John ministered as the last one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Both of them told us that we are priests and that we are a priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A TRANSFORMED CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our concept of serving God has to be transformed and adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To be a priest is not mainly to do something for the Lord, but to be taken over by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must spend much time in the presence of the Lord and let Him come in to fill and saturate us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the beginning of my Christian life, I liked to talk with people about the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now I simply do not have the appetite to talk about work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not a matter of working for the Lord, but a matter of being possessed by the Lord in the presence of His shekinah glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then He will flow out, and that flow will be the real work!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The outflow of God is the real service.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only this flow can fulfill the purpose of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not a matter of a message, a form, or any kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is a matter of being fully and thoroughly permeated by and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then He will flow out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this flow we will not only be one with Him, but also one with all who open themselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this flow is the work, the service, the flow of life, the Body life, and the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must realize that the building up of the Body is not a work or a kind of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a corporate life in the flow of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We all must be saturated and permeated by His shekinah glory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then we will be one with Him, and one with one another in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All Christian work and service must issue out of this priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Please be impressed that God has no intention for us to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No, absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do realize His heart s desire, we will be fully opened to Him that He may flood us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the priesthood, and this is the kind of person God desires to have today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What a blessing, what a priv lege!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Called of God a royal priest,</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That this glorious, holy office</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I should bear, though last and least.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>CHORUS:</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All the building of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the priesthood doth depend;</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Ever praying in the spirit</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I this office would attend.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If I keep this royal calling</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Under Thine authority,</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Priestly duty thus fulfilling</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then the church will builded be.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now the church is but the priesthood;</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus the priesthood formed we need!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When the priests are knit together,</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then the church is built indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Through the church s degradation,</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Saints this office desolate;</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Through the weakness of their spirits</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Preaching doth predominate.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Most are leaning on the message,</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>And the preaching emphasize,</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Yet neglect the priestly praying,</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>And their spirits exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Deal with me and make me balanced,</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>As in preaching, so in prayer;</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Leading others oft in praying,</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>As Thy Word I too declare.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Only serving by our praying,</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Will our spirits mingled be;</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Stressing prayer as much as preaching</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Thus the church is built for Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Hymns, #848</S>
