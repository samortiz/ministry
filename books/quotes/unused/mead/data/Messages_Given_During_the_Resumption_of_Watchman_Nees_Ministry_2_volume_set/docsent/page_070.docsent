   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Need for the Church to Be Filled</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with Men Who Would Listen</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some brothers have asked me, "What is the requirement for me to come to the church in Shanghai?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The requirement is to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you are not told to say something, do not say it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not a question of whether or not a thing should be said, but a question of learning to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One brother by the name of Geh was a college student.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He had had some experience of working for others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He stayed in Shanghai for a number of days, and the church assigned him some work to do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every morning he had to come from ten o'clock until twelve o'clock to transcribe messages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He could not be even one minute late.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was an exercise and a restriction for him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>None of us is an expert.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is through serving that we become skillful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is the need for the church to be filled with people who would listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Listening to Others Saves Much Trouble</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever the different denominations in Chefoo came together, they would argue with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among us, we did not have a large number at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After some trainings, the number increased to eight hundred or one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet there was very little opinion or criticism, and we made very few mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must cultivate this atmosphere in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not like to see many people making proposals concerning a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The brothers have a lot to say; the sisters have even more to say.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes the sisters would even persuade the brothers to agree with them that something ought not be done.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there is the talking, it is better that we do not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are to do anything, it is better that we stop the talking and start listening.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to learn to do the works without having the talking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one in Chefoo can move the chairs around at will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not a matter of why, but a matter of who gives the orders.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything must be done by first checking with others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not being troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, this saves trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the baptismal service, once we baptized one hundred twenty people in one hour and twenty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another time in Shanghai, we baptized one hundred thirty people in a little over an hour; it took only one minute to baptize each one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It took each one only fifteen minutes for the whole procedure, including the time to change clothes; after fifteen minutes the baptized ones were back in their seats already.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THINGS THAT ELDERS SHOULD LEARN</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is different from the home.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What the responsible ones discuss in their meetings cannot be taken outside the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If anyone wants to know anything, he should first ask the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those in the world are used to meetings without discussions, and discussions without decisions, and decisions without actions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the church should not be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once there is a decision, we have to take action.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After the elders make the decision, they should assign someone to execute the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Any decision that is made must not be announced independently.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A brother cannot even tell his wife about the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the meeting is over, the matter should not be discussed any further.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before an announcement is made, no one should pass on the news privately.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One time, words about a decision went out to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I tried to trace the person who spread the word, I found out that the source was a certain wife.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I asked the wife about it, she told me that a responsible brother had told her about it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later I asked that responsible brother, and he admitted that he had said it through an oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Exercising to Be Dealt With in the Flesh,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Being in One Accord,</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Having the Lord as the Center</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not a matter of doing the right thing, but a matter of having the proper exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a person's flesh is not dealt with, he is not qualified to touch God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He can be a "pew-member" or a "Sunday-goer" in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He can even be a good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But he cannot be a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order for the church to be built up in every aspect, both the human affairs and the things of God as well have to be up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here we need God to remove our presumptuousness and our looseness as well.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When a brother or a sister moves to another locality, he or she should not go there to assume any headship or to disrupt the order of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Human organization is different from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A human organization works by voting and by the consensus of the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But spiritual oneness is something spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The secret to all the blessings in the church is to be in one accord and to take the Lord as the center in everything.</S>
