	 <h2 class="head1">TWO TRENDS DURING THE PROCESS<br />
OF TRANSMUTATION</h2>
<p>At the time of Constantine, the transmutation of the church was complete. However, two trends which began during the process of transmutation have continued throughout church history. The first trend is that there has always been a group of spiritual individuals who do not accept the transmutation; the other trend is that those who promote the transmutation believe that they are defending the truth.</p>
<p>Those who promote transmutation claim that it protects the truth; none of them believe that they are speaking heresy. They believe that their actions are in accordance with the truth; whether they are actually in accordance with the truth is another matter.</p>
<p>For example, Cyprian was capable in expounding the Scriptures and believed that he held to the truth. Later, the Roman Catholic Church killed those who followed the leading of the Holy Spirit to oppose the transmutation; the Roman Catholic Church claimed that it was keeping the truth in killing these Christians. Even today, in all his statements and actions, the Pope says that he is acting according to the truth. Although many Christian groups have veered off the proper course, they defend themselves by saying that they are keeping the truth. Despite the fact that they left the truth, they will not admit that they are wrong. These groups have lost the pure, simple nature of the truth and become a complicated and abnormally large mixture.</p>
<p>Matthew 13:31-32 indicates that the church should be a small mustard plant, but shows that it has been transmuted into a great tree. The church, according to its nature, should be like a mustard plant, tender and small. For example, when Paul and Peter passed away, they did not leave a legacy of Paul or Peter &ldquo;the great.&rdquo; However, the marriage of the church to the world caused many things to become &ldquo;great.&rdquo; Now there are &ldquo;great trees&rdquo; all around, and the church&rsquo;s greatest fear is that it would not be even greater; these are symptoms of the transmutation. Although the church in Jerusalem baptized several thousand believers at one time in Acts 2 and 4, it did not become a &ldquo;great tree&rdquo; as a result. Only after Constantine accepted Christianity was the transmutation of the church fully manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FORMATION OF<br />
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH</h2>
<p>When Constantine accepted Christianity, the church had not yet been transmuted into the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church was not fully formed until A.D. 500 or 600. The formation of the Roman Catholic Church was the expansion of the transmutation; the church gradually became more transmuted until the Roman Catholic Church was formed. In other words, the Roman Catholic Church did not come about suddenly but was formed over a period of four hundred years out of the seeds sown at the time of Clement.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR ATTITUDE</h2>
<p>Before the end of the third century, the organization, administration, and basic constituents of the church were transmuted. Therefore, today we must reject all aspects of the transmutation. We cannot allow unsaved ones into the church, we stand against classes in the church, we stand against an organizational unification of the church, and we stand against bishops and overseers being above the elders.</p>
<p>The church must be simple and pure, without such things as a mediatorial class or hierarchy. The churches in all the localities should keep their administration local; they should not be unified organizationally. Among the churches in Taiwan, for example, the church in Taipei is not a higher-level church. The level of spiritual attainment among the churches may be different, but they are all of the same class. The churches have one testimony and one fellowship in the Lord, but they do not have one organization. The churches may have one move, but they should not form a unified organization with a united move. We need to take responsibility for these matters; otherwise, we will soon veer from the course. As soon as we cease to be watchful, we will easily go astray. The constituting element of the church should be simple; the church can be constituted only with saved persons, those who contact God and have the Lord&rsquo;s life. The administration of the church should not have classes or hierarchy, and the organization of the church should not be unified. The church should not be a catholic church, nor should all the churches on the earth be unified; the churches should be entirely local. Unification is an error; we should not and cannot unify.</p>
<p>If the Lord delays His coming and allows His church to continue for another period of history, I hope that these words<br />
will stand as a testimony to condemn every aspect of the transmutation. At the same time, I hope that we would be clear so that our words, actions, behavior, and decisions would not violate this basic principle: We should hold only to what the church had at the very beginning, and we should reject anything that is altered or transmuted.</p>
