<h2 class="head2">Being Exercised in the Thoughts<br />
and Utterances of Our Prayers</h2>
<p>We need to pray to exercise our spirit, but we also need to be exercised in regard to the thoughts and utterances of our prayers. This is because the flow of the Spirit is very much related to our thoughts and utterances. Prayer also helps us to be exercised in our thoughts and utterances. As we are exercised in prayer, our spirit is strengthened, our thoughts become richer and clearer, and our utterances become more focused and accurate. As we exercise in this way, we will increasingly express the sense in our spirit, based on rich thoughts and appropriate utterances. In the meetings some brothers and sisters are moved by the Spirit and are willing to release their spirit, but they lack the necessary thoughts and the utterances to express their inner feelings. Even if they have a little utterance, the shortage in their thoughts and utterances makes it difficult for them to express the inner sense of the Spirit in a rich and full way.</p>
<p>The release of the spirit is often associated with words, because the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and life (John 6:63). Our experience confirms this. Often we receive the flow of the Spirit through the words of the ministry or through the words in the Bible. If we do not listen to messages or read the Bible, it will be difficult for us to have a sense of the Spirit. Our sense of the Spirit can be linked with the ministry of the word and the words of the Bible. The way that we have received the Spirit, consequently, is the way for us to express the Spirit, that is, through words. As long as we can find appropriate words to express our inner sense, there is no need for shouting. Once the words are spoken, the Spirit is released through the words. Hence, we must exercise our spirit by praying, and we must be exercised in regard to the thoughts and words of our prayers so that our prayers are based on rich thoughts and fluent utterances. Then, whenever we are inspired, we will have clear thoughts and appropriate words to match and express the Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration. If there is a feeling in our spirit to praise, we will have words of praise; if there is a feeling to give thanks, we will have words of thanksgiving; if there is a feeling to confess our sins, we will have words of confession; if there is a feeling to petition for something, we will have words to petition. If we are keen in our thoughts and rich in our utterance when we pray, our spirit will be released in a rich way. Once the spirit is released, the water of life will flow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GLORIOUS RESULT</h2>
<p>When we release our spirit by means of prayer, we will be blended into one flow, and we will become one in one spirit. This is the blending of the saints into a fellowship in spirit that flows freely and mingles us together in one spirit. If we are blended to such an extent, the Spirit as the water of life will flow unhindered in the church. In whatever meeting and whatever the occasion, there will be a free flow among the brothers and sisters. There will be no sense of dryness, and everyone will be watered. At the same time, our thirst will be quenched by the living water, and this water of life will swallow up every kind of death. This matches the vision in Ezekiel, the vision of a river that is able to heal the water of the sea and cause all creatures to live (47:8-9). The flow of this living water will solve all the problems in the church, removing all traces of filth, and deal with every factor of death. The whole church will become bright as crystal, manifesting the situation of the New Jerusalem. May we all learn to be exercised and to pray to release our spirit so that God&rsquo;s life will flow unhindered among us to manifest such a glorious result!</p>
