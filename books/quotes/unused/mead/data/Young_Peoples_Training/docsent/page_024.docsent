   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This life-giving Spirit is the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many have never heard of this term.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, you must help them, through the study of typology, to see the holy ointment which is a compound of various spices Exo 30:22-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This ointment is a compound of four spices mixed with olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Formerly, the oil was merely the oil, but after the spices had been added to it, the oil became a compound.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One of the spices signifies the death of Christ and another the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you read carefully, you will see that all the spices indicate the human nature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This implies that in the compound Spirit there is the humanity of Jesus as well as His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the all-inclusive Spirit who gives life and who is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During the past years, many messages have been delivered along this line.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In typology, the meal offering contains oil mingled with fine flour Lev 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even the King James Version uses the word mingled in Leviticus 2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many have criticized us for using the word mingle, saying, How could God lose His nature and be mingled with our nature?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is stupid to argue this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the oil mingles with fine flour, the oil does not lose its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When tea is put into the water to form tea-water, the tea and the water do not lose their nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is foolish to say that they do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although they are mingled, they remain two different elements.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, some Christians are offended by this completion of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because they do not have the completion, they miss a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of having the whole seed with the shell and the kernel, they only have some part of the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They condemn us for being heretical, for having the kernel as well as the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you oppose what I am saying, you will miss the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can testify that I have come here with much blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have not suffered any loss, but you may suffer a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In all the messages given during the past years, I have been doing nothing except completing the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many can say that they have never heard these things before.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reason is that there was a great lack.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now, thank the Lord that in His recovery we are seeing the completion of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE NEED FOR REVELATION AND LEARNING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You can never complete the word of God in a full way in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although I have given hundreds of messages over the past twelve years, the word of God has still not been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not expect to do a quick work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, preach the gospel in the way of completing the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To complete means to cover every point.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If I would only speak of the kernel and not the shell, this also would be incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to be complete on every side and in every aspect, point, and element.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only then will the word of God be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you reach people, do not expect them to be saved overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even after they are saved, they will need completion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not be disappointed at this word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You all need much learning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is a great deal that you need to know: God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, the devil, sin, redemption, the effectiveness of Christ s prevailing blood, objective and subjective righteousness, objective holiness, subjective sanctification, the redemption of your body, how Christ dwells in your spirit, the difference between spirit and soul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without exaggerating, I can say that there are many, many items you need to know.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you contact people, do not preach to them; instead, reach them by getting into their situation, circumstances, and condition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you contact a person in this way, you will realize what part of the Word he is ready for.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If he is not ready to hear of redemption, do not mention it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you would tell him about it, he would not accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Be like a doctor who dispenses different kinds of medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a patient comes to you, you must exercise your discernment to know what medicine is suitable for his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After several days, you may need to change the medication.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must learn and practice this, for, in the long run, this will avail.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not follow the way of the Jesus people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only a few years ago, thousands were baptized in the ocean; but where are they now?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord desires a living testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as He has some to be His living testimony, it does not matter whether the number is large or small.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must gain those who are practically available for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we see that the Lord s desire is to have a living testimony, then we shall not expect to see people saved so quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, we would prefer to work on them, completing in them the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After a certain time, you will realize that the one on whom you are working is ready for a particular point.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then you will help him in that very matter.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In order to do this, you must have some learning, some revelation, concerning God, Christ, the cross, redemption, the divine life, rebirth, and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not think that there are too many things to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Often when you contact people you will realize that you are short in a particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some years ago, we prepared our hymnal containing one thousand and eighty hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although this is a large number, when we are in a certain situation, we realize that we do not have a proper hymn to meet it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if we are rich in songs, then whatever the situation, we shall have a suitable hymn for it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Likewise, if your revelation and learning in the Lord are rich, you will be able to afford people help in any kind of situation.</S>
