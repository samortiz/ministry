<h1 class="title">THE ORGANISM OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4; 1:4-5, 7-11, 13-14, 19-23</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
BEING ABSOLUTELY ORGANIC</h2>
<p>The burden of these messages is to point out that the church is absolutely organic. We need to see that the church as the Body of Christ is altogether organic, absolutely of life, with nothing organizational. The Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God. The Triune God has an organism. An organism and an organization are entirely different. To illustrate this difference, we may compare a living person to a wooden stand. The wooden stand is without life, while a living person is full of life. The wooden stand is an organization of pieces of wood put together, but a living person has many members which are joined together organically. A person is a living, moving, functioning organism, unlike a robot, which is an organization of inorganic parts. The church is not an organization without life, but an organism with life.</p>
<p>One of the most damaging things to the church is organization. History tells us that nothing kills, damages, and annuls the reality of the church as much as organization does. Some may think that the appointment of the elders is something organizational. They may feel that an appointment is always something organizational. We must realize, however, that the elders are appointed according to the manifestation of the measure of their growth in the divine life. To appoint a principal of a school or a manager in a corporation is not according to life. This kind of appointment is organizational. But in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, according to the New Testament, the appointment of the elders is absolutely according to the growth in life. If a brother does not have the adequate growth in life, he cannot be an elder. According to their physical life, older people are elders. Their age comes from their growth in their physical life. Their being elders is an organic matter. In like manner, the elders in the churches are appointed according to the manifestation of the measure of their growth in the divine life. The appointment of the elders is altogether organic, having nothing to do with organization.</p>
<p>To even mention the word organization concerning the church and the church life is wrong. The church and the church life are not in the field of organization. The Apostle Paul told us that the church is God&rsquo;s farm (1 Cor. 3:9). Anything that grows on a farm does not belong to an organization. Rice or wheat cannot be organized by a farmer to grow in a certain way. A farmer plants the seed and then waters what he has planted. His work on the farm is something of life. Planting and watering are matters of life. Paul said, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:6). The church as God&rsquo;s farm, God&rsquo;s cultivated land, is something totally of life, having nothing to do with organization. Paul also tells us that the church is God&rsquo;s building (3:9). A physical building is something of organization because it is composed of lifeless materials. But the church as God&rsquo;s building is not a lifeless building. It is a building full of life. The divine life is the basic and unique factor of all the building materials of this spiritual building, God&rsquo;s house. God&rsquo;s house is an organic matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
FOR HIS FULLNESS, HIS EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>The organism of the Triune God is a Body (Eph. 4:4). The very abstract and mysterious God has an organism. God is invisible, yet He has a visible organism, the Body of Christ. The church as the Body of Christ is for His fullness, His expression. The definition of the church as the fullness of Christ may be illustrated by a cup that is filled with water to the extent that it overflows with water. The water within the cup is seen and expressed when it overflows from the cup. The overflow of the water is the fullness of the water, and the fullness of the water is the expression of the water that is inside the cup. John 1:16 says, &ldquo;For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; We received of the fullness of the incarnated Christ who came as grace and truth (v. 17). The Word became flesh, and He was full of grace and truth (v. 14). The fullness of grace and truth is the fullness of the incarnated Christ. To fill a cup with water until it overflows is to have &ldquo;water upon water.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus was full of grace, grace upon grace. Of His fullness we all have received grace upon grace. The fullness is the expression of the riches. A person&rsquo;s body is his fullness, his expression. A husky American man who has enjoyed so much of the rich foodstuffs of America, the riches of America, may be considered as the fullness of America, the expression of America. The church as the Body of Christ is the expression, the fullness, of Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
