   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO SPIRITUAL JUDGMENT 2 EXERCISING THE SPIRIT Date:September 30, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last chapter we saw the importance of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will consider the importance of exercising our spiritual senses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In contacting others, we have to give them a chance to speak, and we have to learn to discern with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a man does not open his mouth, it is hard to know him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is rare that one can know others without first listening to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps he can get an idea of the general nature of their spirit, but he will not be able to comprehend anything with understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes we know a person's spirit is wrong, but we cannot say how it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In The Character of the Lord's Worker, we pointed out that a worker must learn to listen; he must develop a habit before the Lord of listening to others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even when others are pretending or drifting aimlessly, he still has to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If he does not develop a habit of listening to others, he cuts off all means of knowing them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can know others only through listening to their words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot force them to open their mouth, but once they do, God will provide us the opportunity to know them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more talkative a person is, the easier it is to know him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When others speak, we have to touch their spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the last chapter we spoke of five principles in judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Based on these five principles, we have to sense and know men by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A man's spirit is expressed through his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His speaking can never hide his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As soon as he opens his mouth, his spirit comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When a man speaks, we have to listen to him on the one hand and touch him with our spirit on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way a man speaks tells us about his spirit, and a man's spirit tells us what kind of person he is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, when others speak, our spirit must be unoccupied, open, and pliable so that we can have a proper impression of others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In listening to others and in touching their spirit with our spirit, we have to pay attention to a few conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>SEVEN CONDITIONS OF MAN A Proper Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we listen to others and try to sense their spirit, we first have to find out whether or not they have a proper spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If our spirit is open, we will easily form an impression of them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Based on this impression, we will know within whether or not their spirit is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some people are proper in words and wrong in motive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some people are full of love in their speaking yet full of hatred in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some people talk about gentleness with their mouth yet demonstrate nothing but stubbornness in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man's motive can be different from his words, yet his spirit will always become manifest when his words are released.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please remember that the Lord said, "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" Matt 12:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A man's words cannot be bridled by his will absolutely; sooner or later they will betray his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man's own words will always betray his true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His words cannot hide his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sooner or later his "speech" will betray him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A Galilean can hide his identity if he does not open his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But as soon as he opens his mouth, his speech will betray him, and others will recognize him Mark 14:70 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A man cannot suppress and lock up his spirit forever.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some are proud, jealous, or bitter at heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their spirit is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not listen just to their words and overlook their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not believe the things they say during those moments when their will is in control.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The words that they utter when their will is in control do not represent the true picture; they do not represent their very person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only their spirit can represent their very person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is very basic knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The real condition of a man is the condition that is expressed when his spirit is released; it is not judged by the words he says when his will is in control.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many people are often deceived because they cannot distinguish words from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No matter what others say about a man's motive, we have to check his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Absalom was right in the things he said, but his spirit was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His spirit was a rebellious spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to learn to touch others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the only way to know men, and this is the only way to test the trustworthiness of their word.</S>
