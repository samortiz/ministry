<P>Moreover, its messenger was also recognized by the Lord. This makes it impossible for such a one to be a wolf coming in sheep's clothing. If this messenger had been an unsaved one, the Lord could not have acknowledged him. Not only was this one not excommunicated by the Lord, but he was not rebuked at all. This, of course, refers to his work as a messenger. A stronger proof is that this messenger in Laodicea was one of the seven stars in the right hand of the Lord; he also shone in spiritual darkness. From this we can see the soberness of this word! There is the possibility that a saved Christian can be spewed out of the Lord's mouth! Our sin will not annul our regeneration. It will not make the church no more a church. However, the Lord has a way to deal with people. This is a letter by the Lord to one who has become apostate.</P><P>The spewing here does not refer to eternal perdition. It only shows the Lord's displeasure with the testimony of such ones after they had believed. For this reason He was going to reject them and stop them from being a testimony. The believers should have been in the Lord Jesus' "mouth"! In the same way that the believers long after the Lord, the Lord longs after the believers. He longs to have His dry tongue wet by the love and holiness of His believers. He longs to see "the travail of His soul...and He will be satisfied" (Isa. 53:11). But the believers were like lukewarm water; they had become repugnant to the Lord's taste. As a result, the Lord had to spew them out of His mouth. Is this something that He wants to do? Is His heart not zealously in love with all those who are His? Yet they have forced Him to act this way.</P><P>This spewing will happen at the great trial in the future. It will also have an effect in the millennium. This church is the last church. It is the church that is closest to the Lord's coming. It seems fitting that if the Lord Jesus were to speak to any church about His coming, He should have spoken to this church. But here the Lord did not mention one word about His coming. Is this not strange? There is a reason for the Lord's not doing this. The teaching of His second coming was already a known fact among them. They might even have already preached this! To Thyatira, He linked His coming to the kingdom and told them that His coming would bring them authority and would make them reign with Him. This will be given to those who refuse to reign on earth today. To Sardis, His coming was issued as a warning, because certain ones will be left on earth to go through the great trial. To Philadelphia His coming was a consolation, for they will be raptured and will be delivered from trial to receive a crown. However, He did not speak to Laodicea concerning this matter. In Philadelphia the teaching concerning the Lord's coming is concluded.</P><P>The history of Laodicea is that it had first come out of Thyatira to become Sardis, then had come out of Sardis to become Philadelphia, and finally degenerated from Philadelphia to Laodicea. It had heard the warning concerning being left on the earth to pass through the tribulation. It had also heard the promise of rapture to heaven and deliverance from trial. What more could now be done? The thing to do now is to spew it out, take away its protection, cast it aside on earth, and leave it behind to suffer the sufferings that the world will suffer. It has heard of the power and glory of the kingdom. It has also heard of the danger of the crown's being taken away. It has no desire for it, nor does it seek after it. On the contrary, it has filled its heart with the world. What more can be done? There is no other way now except to spew it out and shut it out of the kingdom into which it has no desire to enter. The pity of Laodicea lies in the fact that the Holy Spirit has worked, grace has worked, and the truth has worked. Yet none of these was able to make it hot. As a result, there is nothing more that can be done except to wait for judgment. The heart of Laodicea is a heart that can no longer be moved. If it were only a matter of not being moved, it still would not be that serious. What it did now was to boast of the work of the Holy Spirit, grace, and truth among it, while not being moved by them a bit. This is indeed pitiful as well as evil!</P><P>Once grace is over, judgment comes. Hence, to Laodicea, there was no mention of the Lord's coming. Of course, there is no doubt that He will come, but the matter was not mentioned to them. What was brought up was another matter. Here the Lord Jesus manifested His light and His nature; He brought up His coming judgment. He will judge them. Judgment is sure; only it is not yet realized. He said, "I am about...," yet this word will be delayed in its fulfillment until the great tribulation and the millennium. "I am about to spew you out of My mouth." The Lord was pointing out here the result of the untasteful salt in His teaching on the mount: "You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything except to be cast out and trampled underfoot by men" (Matt. 5:13). The tasteless Christian will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles together with the city of Jerusalem at the time of the great tribulation.</P><P>Still, we have said that this word does not refer only to the saved Laodiceans. It also refers to the last group of people in the church age. These are neither so cold as to give up all outward appearance, nor are they so hot as to genuinely love the Lord and to love each other with a pure heart. Here we see an empty fa√ßade in unity yet an absolute coldness towards Christ. Nor do we see anything of spiritual worth here. They have replaced fellowship with Christ by humanitarianism and have replaced spiritual regeneration by charitable works. They are very broad for they consider all religious beliefs to be good. Of course, by so doing, there is no more a hatred for sin, nor is there a love for Christ. Yet they will not oppose Christ; they prefer to remain in the church, and they acknowledge the church as an institution. They still want to retain the name of a Christian. There is no spiritual power; there is no love of Christ. There is, of course, no suffering for Him. The best among these are believers who are full of outward activities but who have no heart of fellowship with Christ. The worst among these are the present-day, self-styled, modernistic theologians. There are many different kinds of people among the present-day Laodiceans. They include some who are orthodox in their faith and some whose thinking is wild. Everything that has lost its heart for Christ is Laodicea. The last part of church history is characterized by lukewarmness.</P><P>The meaning of spewing for the present-day nominal church is an eternal rejection by the Lord. He will no longer allow it to be a testimony. God has rejected all testimonies and authorities He previously established. The church is supposed to be the last one. Yet this one is met with the same end as the other ones. In the beginning God appointed the gods to rule over the world. Yet sin was found among them. Therefore God rejected them. What about the Israelites? Although they were temporarily cleansed, they brought seven other demons into their midst. As a result, God also rejected them. What about the Gentiles? From the time of the golden image of Nebuchadnezzar to the blaspheming of Antichrist, when was there a time when they have not rebelled against God? Hence, they are also awaiting their judgment. As for the church, it is hard to believe that its end will be the same as the others. Yet Laodicea is the last section, and here the Lord's verdict is that it will be spewed out of His mouth. Of course, God's judgment will only be executed at the fullness of iniquities (Gen. 15:16). At the present time God will not pull out the tares. But when we lift up our heads to see the field, we know that sin is increasing day by day. Before Christ will come to establish His kingdom of righteousness, we will see the nation of Israel, the Gentiles, the church, and all the powers of the demons joining together as one cord of sin; they will all be judged. The nominal church will not escape this judgment. On the contrary, it will become one of the main culprits in this judgment. In reading the book of Jude and the Epistles to Timothy, we see that God's coming terrible judgment is for the nominal, old church. It is this nominal church that will precipitate God's wrath. How solemn is this thought! Not only will the Israelites and the beast suffer punishment, even the church will suffer the same!</P><P>This is certain, because God Himself has said so. The worst Laodiceans, of which there are many kinds, are those who remain Christians outwardly, but who totally overturn all fundamental beliefs of the saints. These are the antichrists spoken of in 1 John. Of course, a great Antichrist will come in the future, but these smaller antichrists will come from the nominal churches. Antichrist can only come out of places where Christ has been proclaimed, for if men have never known Christ, how can they know that there are antichrists? The antichrists are manifested in the lies they speak after hearing the truth. All present-day apostasies, unbeliefs, and denials of the fundamental doctrines of Christianity will be judged by the Lord. The last rejection of God will not be a political one but a religious one. May God open the eyes of His children, so that they would know the situation of the end times and would not harbor vain hopes, but would be watchful in preparation. The power for the recovery of the church no longer exists now. The tares are now ripe for the furnace. Why then is the wheat still so green and tender and unprepared for the heavenly barn? Each day we live on earth, may we perform our duty in opposing sin. May we oppose it by prayer and by the power of the Spirit, and may we strive to save the perishing ones. At the same time, may we hold fast to what we have in Christ. I do not know of another hour more solemn than this. Be watchful, O saints of God!</P>
