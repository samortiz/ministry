   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR VISION NEEDING TO MATCH THE AGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter we said that God gave men a vision even in the Old Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We cannot say that those who remain in the Old Testament visions do not have any vision at all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yet their visions are not up to date; they do not match the age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the New Testament, after the four Gospels we have the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After Acts we have the early letters of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul went into prison, was released, was imprisoned again, and then was martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By that time, he had written his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All of them concerned God s visions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>About thirty years after his martyrdom, around A.D. 90, the aged John wrote the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was also a book of visions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can say that the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation is a record of visions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Throughout the ages there were many saints who loved the Lord and who feared the Lord, but we cannot say that they all had the vision that matched their age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some, like Gamaliel, were still stuck in the Old Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I believe Apollos somewhat belongs to this category of people, because Acts 18 says that he was powerful in expounding the Scriptures v. 24 . He knew the Old Testament well, but he did not know the four Gospels; he only knew the baptism of John v. 25b . His vision only went that far.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did not see any further vision after John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Case of James</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Acts 15 we find James becoming the leading brother among those in the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although he was a man in the New Testament, he had one foot in the New Testament and the other foot in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His two feet were standing on two boats, and his two hands were holding on to two oars.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was very pious, and he feared God very much.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>History tells us that he was so pious that the skin of his knees grew coarser than an elephant s skin from kneeling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was his piety that attracted many to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was also his piety that made him the chief apostle among those in the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, although he was spiritual, he did not have an adequate vision.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>History tells us that the Pharisees and priests thought that James was for Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They even gathered together the Jews and the Christians around Jerusalem and asked James to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, James feared the Lord very much, and he spoke concerning the New Testament on that occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This upset the Jews, and they killed him on the spot.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is how James was martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is difficult to say whether James s martyrdom was something pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How could God reward him for his ambiguous condition?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All we can say is, Only the Lord knows.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although James was much more advanced than Gamaliel, he also did not have the vision that matched the age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Case of Barnabas</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then there was Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was the one who ushered Paul into his apostolic ministry Acts 11:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Acts 13, when the Holy Spirit commissioned him and Paul to the ministry, he was the leader between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Halfway through their journey, however, there was a turn in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the crucial time came for someone to speak for God, Barnabas had nothing to say, and Paul took his place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From that day onward, Paul became the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, the vision and the revelation shifted to Paul; they were no longer with Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the end of chapter 15, the two of them contended, and they parted from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From that time onward, the Bible does not mention anything further concerning Barnabas s fellowship and work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that Barnabas disappeared from the stage of God s move at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He no longer played a role on that stage.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although he was still in the New Testament, the vision he saw was not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Case of Apollos</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Acts 18 Apollos appeared on the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was a person partly in the Old Testament and partly in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we have seen, he went to Ephesus, and the church in Ephesus first received help from him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the end, Apollos s work dominated Ephesus by virtue of its early arrival.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once Apollos s seed took root in the church in Ephesus, it was difficult to eradicate it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can detect through various hints that the cause of Ephesus s decline was its failure to rid itself of Apollos s seed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From the standpoint of the New Testament, that teaching was a different teaching; it was a different doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The work of Apollos left a lasting mark of different teachings on the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For this reason, Paul was always concerned about the church in Ephesus, as evidenced by Acts 20.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>THE CHURCHES DECLINE</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>THROUGH FORSAKING THE APOSTLES TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>From the time of Paul s first imprisonment to the time he was imprisoned again was a period of about three years.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During that period he charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to take care of the church because there was a problem there.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some were teaching differently.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>During Paul s second imprisonment, he wrote the second Epistle to Timothy to tell him that all the churches in Asia had forsaken his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here we can trace the source of the churches decline.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The cause for the churches decline was the forsaking of the apostles teaching; they forsook the apostles ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because of this forsaking, the teaching of Balaam, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, and the teaching of Jezebel Rev 2 3 crept into the church one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These three kinds of teachings represent the heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the church departs from the apostles teaching, all kinds of doctrines invade the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is very clear.</S>
