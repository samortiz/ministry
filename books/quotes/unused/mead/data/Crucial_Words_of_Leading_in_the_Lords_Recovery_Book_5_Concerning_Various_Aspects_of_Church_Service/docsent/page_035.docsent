   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEARING THE RESPONSIBILITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF LEADING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We hope that everyone will participate in this new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our leading in the past was to hold trainings, make arrangements, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, we now have many saints, especially with the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I return merely to hold trainings, make arrangements, and fellowship, without being blended with you and moving forward together with you, there will be no result.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, this time not only will I be involved in trainings, making arrangements, and having fellowship, but I will also participate in this endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our current status requires a new arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It may seem as though we are familiar with what we have fellowshipped, but the feeling within me is that every point is a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I will try my best to fellowship with you, and I hope that you will try your best to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there are any problems or questions, even if I am in America, we can still communicate on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This will bring in better fellowship, leading, and arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have placed myself in this endeavor and will drive this car with you and learn with you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The small groups concerning which we have fellowshipped involve a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way to do the children s work is also new.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have many ways related to time, location, manpower, teaching material, and goal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not tied down to what we used to do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The campus work has been here for years, but we should be willing to change our way and make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Preaching the gospel in the community may be an old term, but we did not give it much emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This time we are asking the working saints in every profession to open their homes and invite their colleagues to come and hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is also something new.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, the terms visiting, shepherding, and teaching may not be new, but we must admit that we have not carried them out thoroughly in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the reason that we are short in our ability to care for people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will spend much time fellowshipping concerning the way for the church to move forward so that we may find a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church in Taipei just added almost fifty new elders.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That was unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a local church is large, meeting in twenty-one halls, it is not easy for the elders in the halls to take care of administrating and promoting the work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, I must place myself in this endeavor and help bear the burden together with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am sitting behind the wheel with you, and we are driving this car, learning, and studying together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These items of our fellowship are new.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some of these items I myself have not even practiced before.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, I am earnestly asking the Lord to keep me and give me a few years to be with you so that together we may bring all the churches in Taiwan to a new standard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This requires that we all participate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It also requires that all the brothers and sisters receive a burden to pray and coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE TWO PILLARS OF TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>IN THE LORD S RECOVERY TRUTH AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The main burden of this message is to lead the elders and the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is also a fellowship about training.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to see that the Lord s recovery is His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We also need to see that the testimony of the Lord s recovery has two pillars: truth and life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The testimony of the Lord s recovery does not depend on so-called power; neither does it depend on so-called miracles or theological teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The testimony of the Lord s recovery depends on truth and life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether or not the Lord s testimony on the earth is strong and will be propagated largely depends on the extent to which the co-workers, the elders, and the deacons know the truth and grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the saints are strong in the truth and in life, the Lord s recovery will progress, but if the saints are weak in truth and life, the Lord s recovery has no future.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Progressing in Our Knowledge of the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Concerning the truth, we need to have light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Truth is not doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is revelation and vision.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to know the truth, we must read and study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If our reading of the Bible is not thorough and our learning of the truth is shallow, we can be certain that we will not receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The light of the truth is according to our knowledge of the Bible and our spiritual learning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The elders and the deacons must make progress and endeavor to enter into knowing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Holding the Mystery of the Faith</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>in a Pure Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First Timothy 3:9 says that a deacon must hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The faith in this verse refers to the entire content of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The truth in the New Testament is our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, the faith is the things we believe in. We believe in every truth in the New Testament, and we need to understand every truth in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Believers in today s Christianity who are qualified to speak of the faith are rare, because their knowledge of the truth is superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The extent of their faith is that Jesus died for us so that we can believe in Him and go to heaven to be spared from perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Such a content of the faith is far below the standard of the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the recovery there are many important items of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is the truth concerning the economy of God, Christ as life, living out Christ, living in the spirit, and being one spirit with the Lord in our mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These items of the truth are nearly buried in Christianity, but they are what we have emphasized over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These basic items of the truth in the New Testament are the content of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul says that deacons should hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, not in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Often times our mind is very clear, but our conscience condemns us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</S>
