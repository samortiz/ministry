For instance, the first Psalm of Book I represents the concept of the law. Look into the first Psalm of each book, and you will see the improvement. Let us consider several verses from these Psalms. Book II begins, &#8220;As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God&#8221; (Psa. 42:1). Compare this verse with the beginning of Book I, and you will see the difference. There is further improvement with the beginning of Book III: &#8220;Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a pure heart&#8221; (Psa. 73:1). There is even more improvement when we come to the beginning of Book IV: &#8220;Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations&#8221; (Psa. 90:1). Do you see the difference? Finally, Book V begins on the highest plane of all: &#8220;O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth forever&#8221; (Psa. 107:1). And the last, glorious word of the Psalms is, &#8220;Praise ye the Lord.&#8221; That is, &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; I am afraid the last word of the Psalms of many Christians is, &#8220;Blessed is the man who keeps the law.&#8221; But in the real Psalms, the closing word is, &#8220;Hallelujah, praise ye the Lord!&#8221;<h2 class=head1>BOOK I-PSALMS 1 TO 41</h2><p>As Book I indicates how God&#8217;s intention is to turn the seeking saints from the law to Christ, so at the beginning it presents a contrast between the first two psalms. Read Psalms 1 and 2 together. Do you see the difference in these two psalms? One is concerning the law and is according to the human concept of the godly saints, whereas the other is concerning Christ and is according to the divine concept of God.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
