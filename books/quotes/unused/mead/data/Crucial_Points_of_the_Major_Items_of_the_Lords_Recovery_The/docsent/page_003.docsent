   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must be clear that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist simultaneously from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Undoubtedly, the Father is God 1 Pet 1:2; Eph 1:17 , the Son is God Heb 1:8; John 1:1; Rom 9:5 , and the Spirit is God Acts 5:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are not three Gods, but one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Scriptures tell us clearly and definitely that God is only one 1 Cor 8:4; Isa 45:5; Psa 86:10 , yet He is also three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit exist together at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Ephesians 3:14-17 Paul prays that the Father would grant us to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into our inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this passage we have the Father, the Spirit, and Christ the Son, showing again that all three exist together at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have already mentioned 2 Corinthians 13:14, which speaks of the grace of Christ the Son, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, showing the coexistence of the three of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>D. The Eternal Coinherence of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The relationship among the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is not only that They simultaneously coexist but also that They mutually indwell one another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Father exists in the Son and the Spirit; the Son exists in the Father and the Spirit; and the Spirit exists in the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This mutual indwelling among the three of the Godhead is called coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In John 14:10-11 the Lord Jesus said, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we have not only the coexistence of the Father and the Son but also Their coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The three of the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are both coexistent and coinherent.</S>
