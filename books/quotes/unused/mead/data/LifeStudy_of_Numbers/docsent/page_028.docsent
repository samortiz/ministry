   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Separating, Sanctifying, Oneself to God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Following the Dealing with All the Defilements</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is a difference between separation and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Separation is on the negative side, and sanctification is on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the negative side, we separate ourselves from the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the positive side, we sanctify ourselves; that is, we give ourselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First we are separated, and then we are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Separating, sanctifying, oneself to God should follow the dealing with all the defilements chapter five .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is logical, for the dealing with defilement should precede the vow of the Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Priests Being Such by Birth</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The priests, who are such by birth, are ordained by God out of His initiation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A priest must be a Nazarite, a person absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is according to God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One's becoming a priest is a matter of God's initiation; it does not depend on what the person does but on what God does concerning him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Nazarites Becoming Such by a Vow</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Nazarite, who becomes such by a vow, is separated to God by himself out of his initiation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that a person is not a Nazarite by birth but can make himself a Nazarite by making a special vow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the priests are ordained by God out of His initiation, but the Nazarites become such by a vow out of their own initiation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today we are in the Lord's recovery out of God's initiation and also out of our initiation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Accomplishing of God's Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Requiring Man's Cooperation to Complement</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's Ordination</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The accomplishment of God's purpose requires man's cooperation to complement God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is illustrated by the case of Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Samuel was a Nazarite who complemented the deficient Eli, a priest ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In his old age Eli had certain deficiencies.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, Samuel, out of his own initiation, came in to fill up the gap caused by Eli's deficiencies and thereby to complement the deficient Eli.</S>
