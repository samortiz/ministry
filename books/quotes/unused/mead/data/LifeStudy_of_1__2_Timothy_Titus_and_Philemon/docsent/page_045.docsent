   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 1 and 2 are an introductory word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 1 Paul says that he was an apostle not only through the will of God, but also according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The expression "the promise of life" does not mean that we have only the promise and not the life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means that we have received the promised life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A similar term, "the promise of the Spirit," is used in Galatians 3:14.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This term does not mean that we have received only the promise and have not received the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It means that we have received the Spirit who has been promised.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the same principle, the words "the promise of life" denote the promised life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul was an apostle according to the life which God had promised, which Paul had received, and which dwelt within him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul became an apostle by this life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The eternal life according to which Paul became an apostle is incorruptible and unchanging, for this life is actually the processed Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Paul was indwelt by this life, not even the whole Roman Empire was able to prevail over him in its dealings with him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul was strengthened by the processed Triune God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nowhere else but in the opening of this Epistle does Paul say that he was an apostle according to the promise of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Elsewhere he tells us that he was an apostle through the will of God Eph 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not many Christian teachers emphasize the fact that Paul's apostleship was not only through the will of God, but also by the promise of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The reason Christians emphasize the will of God but not the promise of life is that they themselves do not see this matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whatever we do and whatever we are in the Lord's recovery today must be according to eternal life and by this life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Praise the Lord that we are in His recovery by this life!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE DIVINE PROVISIONS FOR THE INOCULATION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The life mentioned in verse 1 includes all the eight basic elements of the inoculation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that eternal life includes a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, the divine gift, a strong spirit, eternal grace, the element of incorruption, healthy words, and the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have this life, which is actually the processed Triune God, we have a pure conscience, unfeigned faith, and all the other provisions of the divine inoculation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us now consider these provisions one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A. A Pure Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 3 Paul says, "I thank God, Whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my petitions night and day."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To serve here is to serve God in His worship Acts 24:14; Phil 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul followed in the footsteps of his forefathers to serve God in a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a time of degradation, a pure conscience, a conscience purified from any mixture, is needed if we are to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have the assurance that all the saints who are so honest, truthful, and faithful to the Lord in His recovery have not only a good conscience, but also a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this matter we should not accept the lie of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we doubt that we have a pure conscience, the more we shall feel that our conscience is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to declare, "Satan, get away from me!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan, don't you know that I am for the Lord and not for anything else?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am for the Lord, for His recovery, for His church, and for His interests."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more we testify in an honest way that we have a pure conscience, the stronger will be our realization that our conscience is in fact pure.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The way for us to have a pure conscience is to declare by faith, honestly, truthfully, and steadfastly, that we have a pure conscience toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not listen to your doubts, and do not believe the lies of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord's blood prevails against him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do not believe the enemy when he says that you are weak, or when he accuses you of being impure and not having a good conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you not love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Are you not for the Lord and His church?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Learn to tell the enemy, "Satan, you have been cheating me long enough.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I will not believe you any longer, and I will not allow you to hold me back.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am for the Lord, and I have a pure conscience."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the eternal life which strengthens us to make such a declaration to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is why I say that a conscience that is pure and good is included in eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because we have eternal life within us, we can be strengthened to declare that we have a pure conscience.</S>
