   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING GRACE IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the local churches we are daily under the dew, under the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whether we are married or single, old or young, we are under the dew that descends upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Oh, how we enjoy the Lord's sufficient, exceeding, manifold, abundant grace!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This grace is the very Lord Jesus Christ Himself as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we wish to enjoy this grace in full, we need to be in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Psalm 133, the grace does not descend upon the homes of individual believers; it descends upon the mountains of Zion, which typify the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, if we would enjoy the dew that descends from Mount Hermon, we need to be on one of the peaks of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If those two brothers in Chefoo had separated themselves from the church life, they would have cut themselves off from the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead of having their problem settled through the Lord's grace in the church, they would have probably tried to settle it in a worldly court of law.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lacking the grace of the Lord, they would have continued to argue with one another according to right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But because they remained in the church life, the heavenly dew descended upon them, and they enjoyed a wonderful solution to their problem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the church life the dew descends upon us richly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are happy because we have the abundant supply of the all-sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The anointing oil and the watering dew are found in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here we experience the anointing, the "painting," of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Simultaneously, we enjoy the processed God as grace, as the life supply for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By this grace we can live a life that it is impossible for people in the world to live.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The brothers can love their wives to the uttermost, and the sisters can submit to their husbands in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a living is possible through the grace we receive on the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should never underestimate the importance of the church as a corporate person who receives the ointment and as the place under the descending dew.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we separate ourselves from the church in these two aspects, we have no further share in the anointing, and we are finished with the enjoyment of the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Other Christians may criticize us for bearing such a testimony concerning the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They may accuse us of narrowness and support their accusation with a word about God's omnipresence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These believers may say that as long as they pray and read the Bible, they can experience the Lord in a full way outside the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, many of us can testify of the difference it makes to be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yes, we can pray and read the Word alone at home.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we do this, we receive a certain amount of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This measure of grace, however, is not as sweet, rich, powerful, inspiring, or sufficient as the grace we receive in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can testify that, no matter whether the meetings of the church are high or low, rich or poor, I experience the ointment and the dew whenever I come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more I come to the meetings, the more I am preserved in the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those, on the contrary, who separate themselves from the church life, cut themselves off from the full supply of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Apart from the Lord's mercy, they may find themselves wholly back in the world after a certain period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us come to the church meetings, even when the meetings do not seem to be particularly rich.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Simply by attending the meetings we are preserved, for the dew still descends upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, simply by being in the meetings, we are under the watering dew.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our experience has confirmed this again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>EXPERIENCING TRUE ONENESS AND PRESERVING IT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The oneness about which we have been speaking is the precious ointment upon Christ the Head and the refreshing dew that descends upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It makes a tremendous difference whether we remain in this oneness or forsake it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christians today feel free to come and go because they do not see this genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They do not have the preserving and keeping element the oneness affords.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In His recovery the Lord has shown us that real oneness is the mingling of the processed Triune God with His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand, the processed God is the compound, all-inclusive Spirit that anoints us and "paints" us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the other hand, the processed God is the life supply for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Under this anointing oil and watering dew we experience true oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as we remain in the experience of the ointment and the dew, it is not possible for us to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, we are preserved in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the meaning of Paul's word in Ephesians 4:3 about endeavoring to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually, this oneness is simply the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We guard and preserve this oneness by remaining under the anointing oil and the watering dew.</S>
