   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING TRAINED IN THE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My main burden in this time is to give you some perfecting in the areas of truth and life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We will have two meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first meeting, we will fellowship about being trained in the divine revelation, and in the second meeting, we will fellowship about being cultivated in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Sixty-six Books of the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being the Complete Revelation of God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Which Cannot Be Added to or Subtracted From</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible's revelation is altogether founded on the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever is hidden in God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When this mystery is manifested, it is a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then when this revelation is seen by us, it is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible is a book of divine revelation 2 Tim 3:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It has passed through many generations, and it was written by many hands.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From the Pentateuch at the beginning of the Old Testament to the book of Revelation at the end of the New Testament, there are altogether sixty-six books.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It took approximately fifteen to sixteen hundred years to complete.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the writing of the New Testament, God's revelation was not yet complete.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the apostle Paul became a minister of the church in the New Testament, he completed the Word of God Col 1:25-26 and fully presented the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the epistles of James, Peter, John and Jude and the book of Revelation, the Bible was fully completed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, at the end of the Bible there is a warning, saying that no one can add anything to or delete anything from this book Rev 22:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we need to read every book, every chapter, and every verse of the Bible, lest we miss our appointed blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Understanding the Bible, Exercising</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our Spirit, Having Our Mind Opened, and</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Having Our Faculties Exercised</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Luke 24:45 says, "Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that in order to understand the Bible, we need the opening of our mind through the enlightening of the Lord's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, we will not have any way to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hebrews 5:13-14 also tells us that in order to partake of God's word, our faculties, that is, our senses or our understanding, need to be exercised through practice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In reading the Lord's word, the mental capacity and the spiritual understanding need to be continually exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible Needing to Be Opened</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>in Order to Give Forth Light</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Psalm 119:130 says, "The entrance of thy words giveth light."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many passages in the Bible cannot be understood without explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can see this from the case of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Philip saw him, he was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Philip asked, "Do you really know what you are reading?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The eunuch said, "How can I unless someone guides me?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 32 then says, "Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so He does not open His mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While he was reading, the eunuch did not understand who the "He" referred to.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, there was the need for Philip to explain to him so that he could preach to him Jesus as the gospel and lead him to believe and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the same way, there are many passages in the Bible which require explanation before one can understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The following list contains some examples of such passages: 1 the seventy weeks Dan 9:24 , 2 the epistle of Christ written on the hearts of the believers with the Spirit of the living God 2 Cor 3:3 , 3 Christ making His home in our hearts Eph 3:17 , 4 being filled unto all the fullness of God Eph 3:19 , 5 unto the dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things Eph 1:10 , 6 becoming the God-chosen inheritance in Christ Eph 1:11 , 7 the mystery of God being completed at the time of the blowing of the seventh trumpet Rev 10:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you merely read passages like these by yourself without any guidance from others, you will not understand them, even if you read them many times.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, your training here is first a training on the truths.</S>
