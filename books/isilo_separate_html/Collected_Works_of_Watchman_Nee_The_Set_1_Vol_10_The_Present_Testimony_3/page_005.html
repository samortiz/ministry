They were "distressed as they rowed, for the wind was contrary to them." Brothers and sisters, if your walk is contrary to the wind, then surely those opposite you will be walking with the wind. If there is an adverse wind from the northeast to the southwest, then there must be a favorable wind from the southwest to the northeast. If the journey which many Christians take is not contrary to the wind, I doubt whether such a journey is ordained by the Lord. We should take the journey that the Lord has ordained. The Lord has already ordained our place on the earth. He said, "The world hates you." Our journey is one that is contrary to the wind. If we have never been opposed, ridiculed, or persecuted by the world, our position must not have come from the Lord. We should encounter adverse wind; we should not run with the wind. If we walk according to what the Lord has ordained, from the northeast to the southwest, there certainly will be adverse wind. Otherwise, I have doubts about our journey.</P><P>"And seeing them distressed as they rowed, for the wind was contrary to them"! Faithful believers experience being distressed as they row, for the wind is contrary to them! In the past few years, temptations have become more numerous and severe than before. Those who belong to the Lord seem to encounter much trouble. Their bodies are often weak and ill. There are often discord and difficulty in their families. Their jobs and living are not as easy as before. Their community and country have increasingly persecuted and attacked them. Even more, Satan and the evil spirits have done their best to stir up trouble with the intention of consuming and afflicting the believers. Oh, these are all adverse winds! If we stand firmly on the course which the Lord has ordained, we will realize that the wind is contrary and indeed distressing! What about the condition in the church during the past few years? We have not seen the Lord raise up any great persons. Heresies of all kinds are more numerous than before. There are more deceptions by the evil spirits and more worldliness than before. In such a generation, by taking the Lord's ordained journey without turning any corner, can we encounter favorable winds and not be distressed?</P><P>Yet we would rather be distressed than drifting. We would rather toil in rowing than wander in drifting. We would rather take the difficult journey than take the easy path and drift. If we want favorable winds, we do not have to turn around; we only need to stop rowing for a moment, and the wind will bring us back to the original spot. Drifting about does not require any effort. If, however, we choose to stand firm, we will feel distressed. As long as we are willing to compromise a little, relax a little, and backslide a little, the wind will carry us back; there is no effort involved. Loving the world requires no effort; neither does following the world require any labor. Standing firm for the Lord and being faithful to Him certainly invite contrary winds. Consequently, there will be toil in rowing.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, it is extremely easy to return to the former place. This is the time for us to choose and the time for us to be faithful. May we take the journey which the Lord has commanded.</P><P>The disciples were rowing from the evening to the fourth watch of the night. The Jews had three watches, and the Romans had four which corresponds with the Chinese system. The fourth watch is probably three o'clock in the morning. They were rowing constantly. Turning back would have been embarrassing for them. Would it not have been better for them to go to Capernaum, tarry, and rest a little? But they did not do this.</P><P>The fourth watch is the darkest hour of the night; it is the very end of the night. It is also the time for us to hold on and continue. I know you have temptations because I also have temptations. I know you have trials because I also have trials. Now is not the time for rebuking because the temptations are too great. The greatest danger and the greatest temptation now is to be a little indifferent and compromise. This is like dozing off for a short while. We are too tired. In the beginning, a constraining love sustained us with strength for a while. But now things seem to have gone on for too long, and the situation has become too difficult. As a result, we become cold. I have seen many believers who were very energetic and brave in the battlefield a few years ago, but who have now become cold and withdrawn. This is because the winds have become too contrary. It is more difficult to overcome a slight indifference than to overcome other temptations. It is easier to overcome sin; journeying on in contrary winds is too tiring, and we tend to become a little cold.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, if the Lord constrained us in the beginning, commanded us to take the journey, and compelled us to cross the sea to the other side, how can we stop from going forward? If we stop, the currents will carry us to a place farther from the Lord, and the favorable winds will also carry us to a place farther from the Lord. We would rather be distressed than drifting. What we need now is the Lord's encouragement. Paul told Timothy, "For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands" (2 Tim. 1:6). "Fan into flame," in the original, means to do a little stirring. Brothers and sisters, may the love we had at the beginning be stirred up again and become vigorous again. Perhaps you have stumbled. Now you should rise up. The writer of the book of Hebrews saw that among the Hebrew brothers, some "may seem to have come short of it" (4:1). Their initial zeal for the Lord seemed to wane. Therefore, he entreated them to "set straight the hands which hang down and the paralyzed knees" (12:12).</P><P>Mr. Muller, who had worked in China, once said that the key to receiving God's great success is to persevere through the last half hour. Brothers and sisters, how many temptations have you overcome? Although the darkness is great, it will not last long. What does Isaiah 21:12 say? "The guard says, / Morning is coming, / But so also is night." Although it is night now, the morning will come shortly. At such times, I beg you to persevere through the last half hour. Our eyes should not be set on the night, neither should we consider only the difficulties. It would be too foolish to quit now, and it would be too foolish to relax now because in a short time we will be over on the other side.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
