   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. To Continue the Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Passover Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>by the Exodus from Egypt as God s Army</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Exodus 12:51 concludes, And it came to pass the selfsame day, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verse indicates that God s complete redemption produces an army.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After applying the Passover according to all the principles given by God, we need to continue our enjoyment of the Passover by making an exodus from Egypt to become God s army to fight for His interests on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to continue our enjoyment of salvation by getting out of the world and becoming part of the army of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the meaning of the term exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What a complete picture of God s salvation is given in the book of Exodus!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we apply Christ as our Passover today, we need all the principles given in the account of the Passover in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>V. GOD S JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>UPON ALL THE FIRSTBORN</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Exodus 12:12 says, I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some may wonder why God killed only the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I was young, I was troubled by this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I wondered if it meant that the firstborn were evil and that the others were good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the time, I was not familiar with spiritual principles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later I learned that the firstborn includes everyone in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Adam, the first man, was actually the firstborn 1 Cor 15:45a .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since Adam was the first man, the firstborn includes all those in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second born, on the contrary, are all those who are in Christ, for Christ is the second man 1 Cor 15:47b .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a very real sense, we who believe in Christ are the second born ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, within us we still have the element of the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although we are under the blood of Christ, the blood does not redeem anything of the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason we must condemn everything within us that is related to the firstborn, that is, to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that, once again, we must condemn the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The terms firstborn and stranger actually describe the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are synonymous terms that describe the old man and the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may say that the old man is the firstborn and that our natural man with the natural life is the stranger.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But these two are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we apply Christ as the Passover, we must condemn both the old man and the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must reject both the firstborn and the stranger.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In God s Passover feast, there is no place for the old man or the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to take this not in a mere doctrinal way, but in the way of practice and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we apply this in an experiential and practical way, we shall realize that we still have a certain amount of the old man and the natural life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This keeps us from applying the Passover in a complete and adequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We still hold on to the old man and the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that the firstborn and the stranger are still within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we cannot apply the Passover in a full way, because God does not allow the old man or the natural life to participate in His Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the principle with respect to God s judgment of all the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>GOD S JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>UPON ALL THE GODS OF EGYPT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 12:12 the Lord also said, And against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This word is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without this part of 12:12, we would not realize that on the night of the Passover, Satan and all the demons were also judged.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The firstborn were the constituents of Egypt, whereas the gods were components of the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During the Passover, both were judged.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is possible to make a list of items that are excluded from participation in the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There could be no leaven, no work, no strangers, no hired servants, no firstborn, and no Egyptian gods.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that there is to be no place for sin, human doing, the natural life, the old man, the world, or Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These items are not only portrayed in the picture of the Passover in Exodus, but they also are clearly revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we keep the Passover according to the detailed principles ordained by God, then we apply the Passover in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Praise the Lord for this full picture of the Passover, God s complete redemption!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In addition to this list of negative things, we can make a list of positive things that are included in the Passover: the lamb, the house, the unleavened bread, the bitter herbs, the hyssop, the girdle, the shoes, and the staff.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All these are components of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The issue of these positive things is God s army.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We who enjoy Christ as the Passover eventually become an army fighting for the kingdom of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As we have pointed out, the Passover ultimately produces an army to fight for God s interests.</S>
