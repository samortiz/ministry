   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Peter and John did not see this when the Lord ascended before their eyes, but the angels saw a tremendous and great train of vanquished foes as a procession for the celebration of Christ's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We were there in that procession; Satan was there; and death was also there.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What a procession that was!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord then presented us, the redeemed saints, His defeated and vanquished foes, as a present to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is as though He said, "Father, here are the persons You have given to Me. They were dead captives of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now I have captured them; I rescued them out of the hand of Satan, out from under sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have also imparted My life into them through My resurrection, the first step of My ascension from Hades to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now they are not dead, but living presents.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I give them all to You as a big, corporate present."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This present included all of the redeemed saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It included Peter, Paul, Martin Luther, John Nelson Darby, and Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am honored to be included in this present.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were all included there in Christ's ascension as a big, living present to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father, no doubt, was so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He could have said, "I am so happy for My redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were dead and captured by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But My Son, through His death and resurrection, rescued them and imparted life into them, making them living."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all must realize that we have already been to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were there with Christ, because He brought us, as His present, to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did not go empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He went to the Father with all His redeemed ones, including you and me, as a corporate present to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Father then gave us back to the Son as gifts for His Body Psa 68:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, through His descension and ascension, Christ rescued us, enlivened us, and made us gifts with His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul was such a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes I have wondered how Paul received such great revelations, such as the revelation in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Undoubtedly, Christ spent some particular time with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After he was saved, Paul went to Arabia and stayed there for a period of time Gal 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one knows what he did there, but, no doubt, during this time there was much contact between him and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe the Lord used this time to constitute Paul into a big gift to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Paul returned from Arabia, he was able to preach and to speak wonderful things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That means he became a big gift to the church in the category of the gifted persons mentioned in Ephesians 4:11.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why he was able to describe Christ's death and resurrection in the marvelous way of verses 8 through 10.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all should learn to preach the gospel in such a rich way as that portrayed in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may speak in this way to our unbelieving contacts: "I would like to tell you that our Savior descended in two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He descended from the heavens to the earth and then from the earth to Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the first step of His descension, He accomplished incarnation; He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the second step of His descension, He entered into death and even went into Hades, dying for us to save us from sin, death, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As sinners, we were captives of Satan, but through the death of Christ we were forgiven and even rescued from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the Lord ascended from Hades to the earth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In His resurrection He imparted Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He accomplished redemption through His death and life-impartation through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we were made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the second step of His ascension, He led us as a train of vanquished foes to the third heaven to give us as a present to His Father.''</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes we should preach the gospel in this way when we go out to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During the time of the Roman Empire, when a general gained a victory, all his captives became a procession in the celebration of his victory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, some of these captives were put to death, and some were given life 2 Cor 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The ones in this procession who were put to death were Satan and his fallen angels, and the ones who were made alive were we, the redeemed saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After we were presented to the Father as a present and the Father gave us back to the Son as gifts, the Son gave us all as gifts to His Body for its building up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 1977 I encouraged all of our young people to do their best to get a proper education.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One young brother among us took my fellowship and went back to school.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, he graduated with a Ph.D. in linguistics and specialized in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In these past few years, he has rendered a great amount of help to me in helping us to improve, to revise, our present Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I was bearing a heavy burden to revise our version, but my knowledge of Greek is inadequate for this task.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This young brother, who took my fellowship twelve years ago to go back to school, has become a great gift to me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He has been like an arm or a shoulder to me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all can be such gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thank the Lord for the gifts given by the ascended Head to His Body for its intrinsic building up.</S>
