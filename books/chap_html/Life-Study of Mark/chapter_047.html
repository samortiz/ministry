The Lord Jesus became a curse for us on the cross (Gal. 3:13). In 15:17 a thorny crown, signifying royalty, was used as a mockery of the Slave-Savior (v. 20).</p><p>In verses 18 and 19 the soldiers continued their mockery of the Lord Jesus: &ldquo;And they began to salute Him, Hail, King of the Jews! And they kept beating His head with a reed and spitting at Him, and kneeling down, they worshipped Him.&rdquo; After they had mocked Him, &ldquo;they stripped Him of the purple and put His own garments on Him. And they led Him out that they might crucify Him&rdquo; (v. 20). The Lord here, as the Passover Lamb to be sacrificed for our sins, was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, fulfilling Isaiah 53:7-8.</p><h2 class="head1">CRUCIFIED AT GOLGOTHA</h2><p>Verse 21 goes on to say, &ldquo;And they compelled a certain passerby, coming from the country, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might carry His cross.&rdquo; Cyrene was a Greek colonial city, the capital of Cyrenaica in North Africa. It seems that Simon was a Cyrenian Jew.</p><p>According to 15:22, &ldquo;They bring Him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, Place of a Skull.&rdquo; Golgotha is a Hebrew name (John 19:17) which means skull. Its equivalent in Latin is <i>Calvaria,</i> anglicized into Calvary (Luke 23:33). It does not mean a place of dead men&rsquo;s skulls, but simply skull.</p><p>Verse 23 continues, &ldquo;And they tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it.&rdquo; This wine mingled with myrrh (and also with gall&mdash;Matt. 27:34) was intended as a stupefying draught. But the Lord would not be stupefied; He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs.</p><p>Verse 24 says, &ldquo;And they crucify Him, and divide His garments, casting a lot for them, what each should take.&rdquo; Here we see that the Lord suffered being robbed by sinners to the uttermost. This was a fulfillment of Psalm 22:18, and it also exposed the darkness of Roman politics.</p><p>Mark 15:25 says, &ldquo;Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.&rdquo; The third hour was nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
