<h1 class="title">THE NEGATIVE FUNCTION OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 2:9; Col. 1:20; 2:15</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEGATIVE FUNCTION OF THE CROSS&mdash;<br />
THE ASPECT OF REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>The cross of Christ not only terminates; it also redeems. The cross terminates Satan, sin, the world, and everything that is contrary to God, incompatible with God, condemned by God, and rejected by God. The cross also redeems everything that God foreordained that He would gain, everything that belongs to God, and everything that is for God. In order to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal plan, the cross of Christ terminates everything that is not of God, that opposes God, and that resists God, and the cross also redeems everything that was lost but that God wants to gain, that is for God, and that belongs to God. This is the negative function of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross Redeeming All Things</h2>
<p>Many people believe that the redemption Christ accomplished on the cross is only for the redemption of sinful and fallen man. However, the Bible speaks of Christ dying on the cross not only for sinners but also for all things. Hebrews 2:9 says that Jesus tasted death on behalf of everything. The blood that Christ shed on the cross reconciles sinful and God-opposing man to God, and it also reconciles to God all things that were affected by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, &ldquo;whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens&rdquo; (Col. 1:20). Thus, Christ redeemed man and all things on the cross. Christ&rsquo;s redemption of all things is related to three matters.</p>
<p>First, all things were created by God according to His eternal plan to express Christ; hence, all things are related to Christ (John 1:3; Col. 1:16). God created all things to fulfill His purpose, but they were defiled by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall before this purpose could be realized. Nevertheless, God did not abandon His desire for His creation to express Christ. God&rsquo;s plan included the redemption of all things in order to accomplish His eternal purpose for Christ related to all things.</p>
<p>Second, God first appointed Satan and then man to be the head and representative of all creation, and He gave them the authority to rule over all things in creation (Ezek. 28:13-14; Luke 4:5-6; Gen. 1:26). Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s subsequent fall defiled all that they represented and ruled. With Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall, creation was no longer in a condition that matched God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. In order for the righteous, holy, and glorious God to use creation in His glorious plan for His Son, Christ had to taste death on the cross on behalf of everything, according to the requirements of His righteousness, holiness, and glory.</p>
<p>Third, God created all things to be a delight to Christ. The Bible unveils that Christ found delight in and loved created man and that He also found delight in and loved all things that God had created for Him (Rom 8:28; 11:36; Eph. 1:23; Col. 1:20). Christ died on the cross for all things, and He redeemed them according to God&rsquo;s predetermined will, according to the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Joined to All Things<br />
in Order to Redeem All Things</h2>
<p>In order for Christ to redeem all things, He had to be joined to all things. In order to redeem all things that had been lost and to taste death on behalf of everything, Christ entered into creation and was joined to it. In His incarnation the Word became flesh in order to be joined to man and to all things (John 1:14). Although the incarnation was necessary in order to impart the uncreated life of God into created man through Christ&rsquo;s putting on of humanity and all things, incarnation was also necessary in order to redeem man by His suffering God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on behalf of man and all things.</p>
<p>Christ became flesh to be joined with creation, including man and all things; He put on creation. Hence, creation was hanging on Christ when He was on the cross, because it was included in Christ. When Christ died on the cross, He not only terminated all things but also suffered God&rsquo;s judgment and tasted death on behalf of all things in order to redeem man. Christ&rsquo;s death was an all-inclusive death that terminated all things and redeemed all things. His death terminated all things condemned by God and redeemed all things that God wanted to gain.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s being joined to all things and His bringing all things with Him through the judgment of His death are typified by the ark that passed through the judgment of the flood in Genesis. The ark contained Noah&rsquo;s family of eight and all the animals (chs. 7&mdash;8). The ark typifies Christ, and Noah&rsquo;s family typifies redeemed man. Noah&rsquo;s family being in the ark means that redeemed man is in Christ. The animals that were in the ark typify all things being redeemed in Christ. The animals in the ark passed through the judgment of the flood. Similarly, all creation passed through the judgment of death in Christ. The animals were included in the ark and passed through the flood so that they might be redeemed. Similarly, creation was joined to Christ and passed through death in Christ in order to be redeemed. Just as the ark redeemed the animals from God&rsquo;s condemnation and judgment so that they would be acceptable to God, Christ redeemed all things from God&rsquo;s condemnation and judgment into His presence so that creation would be acceptable to God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
