   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>One time a brother was going to do a certain work for the Lord, yet he realized that the inner regulating was demanding him to stop the work.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, he had the intention and the desire to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He argued with the Lord, saying, "Lord, that work is so good and so helpful to others, and it is also profitable for You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Besides if I do it, the church will be helped a lot."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But no matter how much he argued with the Lord, the more he went to do it, the more he lost the inner peace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more he went to work on that project, the more he lost the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did a lot of good things, but he was wrong with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today we maintain a proper relationship with God not by doing good things but by going along with the inner regulating.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You need to take care of the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How do you know you are taking Christ as life?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are really taking care of the inner anointing, you will go along with it even if it stops you from doing good things such as sacrificing yourself to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You should not argue with the Lord that this is something good, something for Him, or something for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord just wants you to take care of the inner anointing and regulating.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You need to take Christ as life by taking care of the inner regulating.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do not go along with the inner regulating, you are not a person taking Christ as life all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ as life is in you as the living law regulating you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In all things He is the law; you are not the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the rule; you are not the rule.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is the living rule, the living law, always regulating you from within.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then there is also the matter of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 8:6 tells us that "the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How do you know that you are taking Christ as life?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By the sense of peace in you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everything within you and every part of your being is peaceful, restful, and at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you are taking Christ as life, when you are in the light, in the flow, and under the regulating, you have the wonderful, perfect peace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not an outward peace but an inward peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the peace in the heart, in the spirit, and even in the soul in the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have the whole peace, the perfect peace, the heavenly peace, the divine peace within you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How do you know you are taking Christ as life?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just by checking if you have the fellowship, the joy, the shining, the regulating, and the peace all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many Christians neglect their inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They work, walk, and have their being on their own and according to their moral standard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To them, as long as they are not doing something evil, it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They do not take care of Christ within them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers and sisters, we should not be such poor Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to take care of the inner life all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today Christ is the living One Rev 1:18 within us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, we have the flow, the joy, the light, the law, and the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have the living One within us flowing, shining, and regulating.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that we are in Christ, taking Christ as life, living by Him, and consequently, having the image of Christ expressed in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we have Christ within as our life, surely we will have the expression of Christ without.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The way to take Christ as life is to take care of the inner sense, the inner registration, and to check if you have the inner flowing, the inner shining, the inner regulating, and the inner joy with the inner peace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you have all these inner things, you are in Christ taking Him as your life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If not, you are outside of the experience of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, no matter how good you are apparently and outwardly, you still need to check with your inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You are in Christ taking Him as life only when you have the inner flowing, shining, and regulating with joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the right way for us to experience Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Very few Christians are living in the inner life, but many Christians are living in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to be Christians in the inner life, always learning to take Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to forget about ourselves and take Christ as our life by checking to see that we have the inner flowing, shining, regulating, joy, and peace.</S>
