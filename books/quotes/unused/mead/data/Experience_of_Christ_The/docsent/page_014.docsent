   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOSING THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our need today is very similar to that of the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter one Paul said of the Philippians, "I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I feel the same way toward all the dear saints in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I can sincerely say that I praise the Lord for all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, I am somewhat concerned that you may not have very much enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps when you first arrived in your locality, you had considerable enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But as time has gone by you may have lost this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reason for this is that there is a problem in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Either the sisters are too much in the emotion, or the brothers are too much in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we all have a problem with our stubborn will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My burden is that this stubborn will would be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of those who have been in the Lord's recovery a long time are like children eating food without enjoying it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When they first came, everything was enjoyable, but many do not have this enjoyment today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason many lose the enjoyment of Christ is the problem they have in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The young people may be very active in preaching the gospel on the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They may pray, praise, and shout hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But all this may become merely the carrying out of a duty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There may not be much enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you do not have much enjoyment of Christ, it indicates that you are not one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Your thoughts and emotions differ from those of others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The reason Euodias and Syntyche were not one was that they had a problem in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were not thinking the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THINKING ONE THING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It seems that it is impossible for us all to think one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, the Bible charges us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul's word in Philippians about thinking one thing is not history.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In other words, he was not telling us how the Philippian believers were thinking one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the contrary, it is a word of advice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In our humanity it is impossible for us to carry out Paul's advice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But it is possible by the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we live by the Spirit of Jesus and not by our soul, we shall be able to think one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Notice that Paul does not say to praise concerning one thing, or to pray one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To praise and pray are matters in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thinking, however, is a matter in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we have seen, the hindrance to enjoying Christ is not in our spirit, but in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And the problem is mainly not with our stubborn will or perplexing emotion, but with our troublesome mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But our mind is affected by our emotion and will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If our emotion is not finely tuned and if our will is not subdued, we shall not think properly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>DEALING WITH THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For years, we have spoken about the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Christ, but we have not seen the detailed way to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, l have been burdened to give a number of messages on the way to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to enjoy Him, we need to deal with every part of our soul, especially with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If our way of thinking is dealt with, we shall have the proper taste for Christ and we shall both experience Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We shall not only eat, but enjoy what we are eating.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether or not we enjoy the food we eat depends upon our taste.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Concerning Christ, our taste is mainly with our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the reason that concerning the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Christ, we need to deal with the various parts of our soul.</S>
