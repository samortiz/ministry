<h1 class="title">HE THAT HAS THE SON HAS LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 John 5:11-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Son of God is God in another form
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Son of God is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is God come as a man in order to save man.</li>
	<li>The Son of God is God made manifest to man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s life is in the Son of God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is in His Son, so God&rsquo;s life is also in the Son.</li>
	<li>The life that is in the Son of God is the eternal life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>He that has the Son of God has life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Life is within the Son of God. If man wants to obtain life, he must receive the Son of God.</li>
	<li>Once man receives the Son of God, he has God and also the life of God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The proof of having life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>1 John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He that hath the Son hath the life.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>The proof that someone has obtained life is that his living has changed. Describe how once a man receives the Lord, his life is changed.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to obtain the Son of God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you do not have God&rsquo;s life.</li>
	<li>Believe in the Son of God.</li>
	<li>To believe means to receive the Son of God as Savior with our heart and our spirit.</li>
	</ol></li>
