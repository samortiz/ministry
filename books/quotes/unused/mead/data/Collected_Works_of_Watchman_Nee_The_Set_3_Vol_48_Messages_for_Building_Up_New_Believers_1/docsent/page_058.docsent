   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN PRAYER Scripture Reading: John 16:24; James 4:2-3; Luke 11:9-10; Psa 66:18; Mark 11:24; Luke 18:1-8 I. PRAYER BEING A BASIC CHRISTIAN RIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christians have a basic right while living on earth today, the right to receive answers to prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The moment a person is regenerated, God gives him the basic right to ask of Him and to be heard by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 16 says that God answers when we ask in the name of the Lord so that our joy may be made full.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we pray without ceasing, we will live a Christian life that is full of joy on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we unceasingly pray, yet God does not unceasingly answer our prayer, or if we have been a Christian for years and God hardly or never listens to our prayers, there must be something seriously wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have been a Christian for three to five years without receiving one answer to prayer, we are ineffectual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not just a little ineffectual, but very ineffectual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are children of God, yet our prayers are never answered!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This should never be.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every Christian should experience God answering his prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every Christian should have frequent experiences of prayers being answered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a basic experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God has not answered our prayers for a long time, it means that there is surely something wrong with us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no way to deceive ourselves in the matter of answers to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If it is answered, it is answered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If it is not answered, it is not answered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If it is effectual, it is effectual.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If it is ineffectual, it is ineffectual.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We would like to ask every Christian: Have you learned to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Has God answered your prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is wrong for prayers to be left unanswered, because prayers are not just a speaking into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Prayers are meant to be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Unanswered prayers are vain prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christians must learn to have answered prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since you have believed in God, your prayers should be answered by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Your prayers are useless if God does not answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must pray until your prayers are answered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Prayer is not only for spiritual cultivation but even more for receiving answers from God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Prayer is not that easy a lesson to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A person may be a Christian for thirty or even fifty years and yet not learn to pray well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, prayer is not a simple thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, prayer is so easy that a person can pray as soon as he believes in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Prayer can be considered the most profound as well as the simplest subject.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is so profound that some still cannot pray well despite learning about it all their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many children of God feel that they do not know how to pray even up to the time they die.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, prayer is so simple that the moment a person believes in the Lord, he can start praying and have his prayers answered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you begin your Christian life in a good way, you will always receive answers to your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do not have a good start, you may not have an answer to prayer for three or even five years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you do not have a proper foundation, you will need much effort to correct it later.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, once a person believes in the Lord, he must learn to receive answers from God for his prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We hope that every believer will pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>CONDITIONS FOR PRAYERS BEING ANSWERED</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Bible we can see many conditions for having prayers answered, but only a few of them are basic.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We believe that if we meet these few conditions, our prayers will be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These few conditions are equally applicable to those who have prayed for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are very basic conditions, and we should pay attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A. Asking</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All prayers should be genuine petitions before God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After a brother was saved, he prayed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One day a sister asked him, "Has God ever listened to your prayer?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To him prayer was just prayer; why did anyone have to bother about whether or not they were answered?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From that time on, whenever he prayed, he asked God to answer his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He began to consider how many of his prayers were answered.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He discovered that his prayers were quite vague and capricious.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It did not matter whether God answered them, and it did not matter whether God ignored them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They were like prayers to God for the sun to rise the next day; the sun would rise whether or not he prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He had been a Christian for a year, yet none of his prayers were answered.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All that time he had been just kneeling and muttering words.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He could not pinpoint what he had asked for.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This amounted to not having asked for anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord says, "Knock and it shall be opened to you" Matt 7:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If what you are knocking on is just the wall, the Lord will not open the wall to you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But if you indeed are knocking on the door, the Lord will surely open the door to you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you ask to go in as well, the Lord will surely let you in. The Lord said, "Seek and you shall find" v. 7 . Suppose that there are many things here.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Which one do you want?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You must ask for at least one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You cannot say that anything will do.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God wants to know what you specifically want and what you specifically are asking for.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Only then can He give it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, to ask means to demand something specific.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is what it means to seek and to knock.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Suppose you want something from your father today.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You have to ask for the specific thing you want.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you go to a pharmacy for medicine, you must say exactly what medicine you want.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If you go to a market to purchase vegetables, you must say what vegetables you want.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is strange that people can come to the Lord without saying what they want.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is why the Lord says that we need to ask and ask specifically.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The problem with us is that we do not ask.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The hindrance is on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In our prayers we need to speak what we need and what we want.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do not pray an all-inclusive prayer in a frivolous way, caring little whether or not it is answered.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A new believer needs to learn to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He needs to pray with a specific goal in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>"You do not have because you do not ask" James 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Many people go through the motion of prayer without asking for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is useless to spend an hour or two hours or even eight or ten days before the Lord without asking for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You need to learn to ask for something; you need to knock, really knock hard, at a door.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Once you clearly identify the entrance and seek to go in, knock hard at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When you seek something specific, you will not be satisfied with just anything; you want that particular thing.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Do not be like some brothers and sisters who stand up in the meeting to pray for twenty minutes or half an hour without knowing what they want.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is strange that many people have long prayers that do not ask for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You must learn to be specific with your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>You should know when God has answered your prayers and when He has not answered your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If it makes no difference to you whether or not God answers your prayers, it will be hard for you to effectively pray to Him if you come across a difficulty in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Empty prayers will not be effectual in times of need.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If prayers are empty when needs are specific, one cannot expect any solution for the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Only specific prayers can deal with specific problems.</S>
