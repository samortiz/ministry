[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Los Angeles, California in the spring of 1971.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE MAN IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-28; Psa 8:3-9; Heb 2:5-9, 16
[4]  Man is the center and meaning of the universe because God has fully entrusted man with His purpose.
[5]  God did not commit Himself to any of the millions of other created items.
[6]  At the beginning of this chapter in the Scripture reading, we have listed three portions from the divine Word: Genesis 1, Psalm 8, and Hebrews 2.
[7]  Genesis 1 says that God made the decision to have man in His own image and to have man entrusted with His authority.
[8]  To be saved is to have God identified with you, to have God incarnated in you, to have God become one with you.
[9]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST IS THE MEANING OF HUMAN LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-28; Matt 3:2; 5:3, 10, 48; 6:9-10, 31-33; Rom 14:17; Rev 11:15; 2 Tim 2:12
[10]  In the previous chapter, we saw that man is God's expression and His representative with His authority.
[11]  I wish to put these things in a more simple and practical way.
[12]  People talk much about the so-called Sermon on the Mount.
[13]  But we must see that unless we become the children of God, we cannot practice the Sermon on the Mount.
[14]  In Matthew 6:32 the Lord Jesus told us that our "heavenly Father knows that you need all these things," and then in verse 33 He spoke a word as a promise: "Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."
[15]  Now when the young people ask me about whom they should marry, I answer, "I don't know.
[16]  I can only tell them that if they feel led of the Lord to marry that sister or that brother, then they should just go ahead and do it.
[17]  CHAPTER THREE CHRIST IS THE MEANING OF HUMAN LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: John 6:57; 14:19, 20, 23; 15:4-5; Gal 2:20a; Eph 3:16-17; Phil 1:20b-21
[18]  I would like to impress us again with the five wonderful statements mentioned in the first chapter which specifically express the burden of this book.
[19]  For the past years we have been stressing Christ as our life, but in recent days the Lord has shown us that He is also a person.
[20]  You as a person abide in Christ, and He as a person abides in you.
[21]  After I had given some messages concerning taking Christ as our person, a sister testified that in the past she had difficulty going to sleep at night.
[22]  CHAPTER FOUR CHRIST IS THE MEANING OF HUMAN LIFE 3 Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9; John 1:4; 10:10b; 7:37-39; 6:63; 1 John 1:2; 5:11-12; Col 3:4; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rev 21:6c; 22:1-2, 17; 7:17 SEEKING FIRST HIS KINGDOM
[23]  Before we continue with the matter of Christ as the meaning of human life, let us review some of the points covered in the preceding chapters.
[24]  By no means was according to Peter's religious concept.
[25]  Peter did not behave in the right way which is according to God.
[26]  You do not know how much you have been deceived by your old religious concepts, nor have you realized how much you are preoccupied with the religion which you inherited from your forefathers.
[27]  I believe the Lord is going to move in a fast way.
[28]  When the day of Pentecost came, three thousand were saved on that one day Acts 2:41 .
[29]  In Genesis 1 we see man with God's image and God's dominion.
[30]  Then in Genesis 2 there is the tree of life v. 9 . By reading through the Bible we know that the tree of life is a symbol of Christ.
[31]  Once we have been born again and have Christ as life, we see the kingdom, the dominion, the authority, of God.
[32]  Ephesians 1 says that Christ was raised from the dead and seated in the heavenlies v. 20 . He had all things subjected under His feet and was given to be Head over all things to the church v. 22 . The resurrection of Christ, the ascension of Christ, the enthronement of Christ, and the glorification of Christ, all are for the church.
[33]  My burden in this chapter is mainly to fellowship with you concerning the church being Christ.
[34]  First Corinthians 12:12 fully, clearly, and definitely reveals that the church is Christ.
[35]  This verse says, "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ."
[36]  When we say that the church is Christ, this Christ is not an individual Christ, but a corporate Christ.
[37]  But if you come with Christ, I come with Christ, and he comes with Christ, we are Christ not the individual Christ but the corporate Christ.
[38]  I am also burdened to share with you that in the church there are no ordinances.
[39]  We have seen that we all are Christ, so we all are one Body Eph 2:16 , which is Christ 1 Cor 12:12 .
[40]  Most of us have heard that on the cross Christ took away our sins, and some of us probably also have heard that on the cross Christ crucified our old man and defeated Satan.
[41]  The problem today is that we Christians are always self-centered and self-concerned.
[42]  We do not see the Body or realize that the Body is all-inclusive.
[43]  As long as someone is a dear brother in the Lord, that is good enough.
[44]  No matter what he does in the meeting, you have to love him because he is a brother in Christ.
[45]  We have seen that the church is the Body of Christ and the expression of Christ.
[46]  Now we need to realize that this church as the Body of Christ needs the local churches.
[47]  The church is the expression of Christ, and the local churches are the expression of the church.
[48]  In the previous chapters we saw three things: first, man is the meaning of the universe; second, Christ is the meaning of human life; third, the church is the expression of Christ.
[49]  But we have to know that if we want to have a certain living, we need a certain life.
[50]  God created man with a life that desires to be in a community, but that life was damaged and poisoned.
[51]  Thus, on the one hand, because we have the God-created nature, we have the desire to live with others; on the other hand, because our human life was damaged and spoiled by Satan, in our fallen nature we do not have the proper life for communal living.
[52]  Furthermore, in John 15:16-17 the Lord Jesus said, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit...These things I command you that you may love one another."
[53]  Matthew 28:19 also shows us that when we go to disciple others, we need to have the realization that we are in the Triune God.
[54]  Then you can tell others that you are in the Triune God and that you want to put them into the Triune God.
[55]  If you mean business with the Lord, and if today you are high on the top of a mountain, realizing that all authority is His and that you are really in the Triune God, then you already have the power.
[56]  Another thing that I want to fellowship with you is that you need to be built with others.
[57]  As long as you are not built together with others, you are low, you are through with the authority of Christ, you are outside of the Triune God, and you do not have the faith to claim the power.
[58]  In the church which was in Antioch, there were five prophets and teachers who were built into the church.
[59]  The guidance from the Holy Spirit came to them as representatives of the church Acts 13:2 .
[60]  Then in the church you will get the guidance, and from the church you will go out, not to do some mere preaching work but to produce and establish the local churches.
[61]  They went out from the church, the work they did was for the church, and eventually they came back to the church in Antioch v. 26 . Remember that their work was "from the church, for the church, and back to the church." With them everything was for the church.
