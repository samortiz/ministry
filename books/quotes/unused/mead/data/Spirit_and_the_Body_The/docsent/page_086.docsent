   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GIFTS USED AS TOYS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Corinthians 1:7 Paul said that the Corinthians came behind in no gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, in 3:1 he said, "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul told the Corinthians that they were not only childish, but even babyish.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Babies always have more toys.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Who do you think has the most toys a little baby, a middle-aged person, or an elderly person?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Obviously, the babies have the most toys, for toys are made for babies and children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you read 1 Corinthians carefully, you will see that Paul's concept was that playing with the gifts is like playing with toys.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may ask, "Where is the verse saying that the Corinthians were like children playing with toys?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, no verse says this explicitly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if you consider the whole book, you will realize that this is exactly Paul's meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Corinthians 1:7 Paul told them that they did not lack any of the gifts; in 3:1 he said that they were babyish; and in 13:11 he said, "When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What did Paul mean by "childish things"?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you read chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen, you will have to admit that the childish things are the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some who oppose speaking in tongues claim that it is childish.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the childish things in 13:11 refer not only to speaking in tongues, but also to prophecy, teaching, and even to the three leading gifts of apostles, prophets, and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you play with these things, to you they become childish things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul seemed to be saying, "You Corinthians are playing with the gifts just as children play with toys.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To you, prophecy, teaching, speaking in tongues, healing, and miracles are all toys.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To you these have become childish things."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where can you find a group of Christians in which no one plays with toys?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a group does not exist because Christians everywhere play with toys.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are honest and fair, we shall admit that this is also true with us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether or not we play with toys depends upon the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No matter how much the young ones say that they do not play with toys, the fact is that they do play with them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I checked with my eight-year-old grandson, he said that he was a good boy, that he behaved himself, and that he did his homework.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He also told me he enjoys reading the Bible, and he then proceeded to read me the first eighteen verses of John chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was happy that he could read all the words so well.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But immediately after talking with me, he began to show off by walking on the sofa and the coffee table.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more I asked him to stop, the more he went on.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To him, everything is a toy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When he helps me water the planters in the yard, he plays with the water pot and the planter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, I am not angry with him, because I realize that he is a child who likes to play and to make a toy out of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he did not play with things, it would indicate that he was ill, for the only time little boys do not feel like playing is when they are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The young people in the church need to realize that they are still playing with toys.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When they hear this, they may be disappointed and say, "Brother Lee has said that we are children playing with toys.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let us forget about the meetings and stay home."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you do this, it is an indication that you are ill.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead of staying home you should come to the meetings and play with your toys.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not be disappointed to learn that you are still a child.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am happy to see the young ones playing with toys.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I see my grandchildren at play, I am happy to know that they are strong, active, and normal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, I am happy to see you play with toys in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, I would not be pleased if the elders were to play with toys, because they are past the age of playing with toys.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is healthy for children to play.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you forbid them to play, you will kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is the same in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to encourage the young ones to go ahead and play with their toys in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We realize that when they function in the meeting it is like playing with a toy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, for the older ones to play in such a way would be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We in the church are not an army or a school, but a large family including those of every age.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, in the meetings there must be activities for all ages.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who play with toys should not be unhappy with the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The playing ones are the young ones, the fresh ones, the young people who have been saved a very short time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They need to be able to play in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to give them the opportunity to do so, we need to conduct the meetings in a family way.</S>
