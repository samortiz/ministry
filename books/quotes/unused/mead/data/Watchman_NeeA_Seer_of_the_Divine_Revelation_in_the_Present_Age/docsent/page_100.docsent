   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Such is the way that Watchman Nee ended his time on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In May 1989, after a period of seventeen years, his ashes and the ashes of Mrs. Nee were both transferred by his two nephews from Chekiang to a public cemetery in Shiangshan in the city of Soochow of Kiangsu province.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They were both buried in "The Christian Cemetery" beside Watchman's brother Nee Hwai-tsu and the latter's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Watchman Nee was a man of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Along his pathway of following the Lamb, he suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today as a result of his suffering, we have such a rich heritage in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The following two stanzas are the conclusion to Hymn #635 in our hymnal, which is on the suffering of the grapevine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These words, which he helped me arrange into singable verse in Hong Kong in 1950, summarized his entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not by gain our life is measured,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But by what we've lost 'tis scored;</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>'Tis not how much wine is drunken,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But how much has been outpoured.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For the strength of love e'er standeth</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the sacrifice we bear;</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He who has the greatest suff'ring</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ever has the most to share.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He who treats himself severely</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Is the best for God to gain;</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He who hurts himself most dearly</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most can comfort those in pain.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He who suffering never beareth</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is but empty "sounding brass";</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He who self-life never spareth</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Has the joys which all surpass.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Watchman Nee realized that life is measured not by gain but by loss and that the one who has suffered the most has the most to share with others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, he never spared himself, but bore the cross and the fellowship of Christ's suffering, being conformed to His death, in order to live Christ out that others might be nourished and enriched with Him.</S>
