   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Resulting in the Rebellion of Babel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we come to the end of the Bible, we see that the kingdom will result in a very unpleasant situation in a great rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is the same with the type in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How good it was that Noah enjoyed peace in the kingdom and that mankind was recovered back to the beginning to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the issue of it all was the rebellion at Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The rebellion of mankind at Babel was altogether due to the work of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 Satan Usurping Man to Misuse the God-given Authority</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>to Form Nations</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan usurped man to misuse the God-given authority over others to form nations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God gave man authority to rule over others that there might be peace, but Satan usurped man and caused him to misuse this authority to form nations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although God did have the intention that man rule over others, He did not intend for man to form nations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The forming of nations was the work of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Satan caused man to misuse his authority, using it to form nations and to establish little empires for man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2 Satan Instigating Man to Rebel against God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan instigated man to rebel against God by building the city and tower of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The building of the city and tower of Babel was a declaration of independence from God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Mankind was declaring that it had become independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3 Judged by God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That rebellion was judged directly by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God judged the earth at the time of the flood, He did not do it directly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He sent a flood to judge that age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, at Babel God came down personally and judged that rebellion directly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not send anyone else to deal with that rebellion; He dealt with it Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>e. The Church Being the Kingdom in Reality</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we come to the New Testament where we see the real kingdom, the kingdom in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament is a book of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The whole New Testament is on the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is the first item of the preaching in the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The kingdom is preached in the opening chapters of the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The New Testament preaches the gospel in the way of the kingdom, not in the way of going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The New Testament does not say, "Repent, for heaven is ready for you."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It says, "Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near" Matt 3:2; 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today people hear thousands of gospel messages.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Have you ever heard a gospel message telling people to repent because the kingdom is coming?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In my whole life I have not heard one such message.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Christians preach the gospel nowadays, most of them always talk about sin, heaven, and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hardly anyone speaks about the gospel as related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in its first preaching of the gospel, the New Testament tells us to repent for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The gospel is for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The purpose of the preaching of the gospel is that men might enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The gospel is proclaimed that people might be saved, qualified, and equipped to enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Regeneration is for the kingdom John 3:3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you have not been regenerated, you cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Have you been saved, washed in the blood, and regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For what purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before I came into the church life, I was told that we had to be saved, washed, and regenerated that we might go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the church, we have seen something higher that we have been saved, washed, and regenerated for the church Eph 5:25, 23; Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The gospel of the kingdom brings the rebellious sinners into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But now we need to see what is the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The reality of the church is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you have been saved, washed, and regenerated for the church, it means that you have experienced these things for the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>My burden in this message is to share with you what is the real church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The real church life is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The gospel is for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Being saved, washed, and regenerated is altogether a matter of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church is the kingdom in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some Christians insist that this age is the church age and that the kingdom has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to their concept, after the church age is over, the kingdom age will begin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although this understanding is in a sense correct, it is not correct in every sense.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As we shall see, the church today is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The proper, real, and living church is the kingdom, and the kingdom is the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If there is no kingdom, then there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our salvation and regeneration are for the church, and the church is the kingdom.</S>
