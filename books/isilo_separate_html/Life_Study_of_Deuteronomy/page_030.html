FOR THE TRAINING OF THE NEW GENERATION<br>AFTER THE PURGING OF THE OLD GENERATION<br>THROUGH THEIR WANDERING OF<br>THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS</H2><P>The rehearsal of the law is the respeaking of the law. This rehearsal, this respeaking, was for the training of the new generation after the purging of the old generation through their wandering of thirty-eight years in the wilderness. That wandering had been used by God to produce a new generation, and this generation needed the training of the law. They needed to be trained with and by the law.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE REHEARSING OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS</H2><P>In 5:1-31 we have the rehearsing of the Ten Commandments.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Ten Commandments Being<br>the Covenant God Made with Israel at Horeb</H2><P>Verses 2 and 3 say, "Jehovah our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. Not with our fathers did Jehovah make this covenant, but with us, we who are all here today alive." This indicates that the Ten Commandments were the covenant God made with Israel at Horeb, especially with the present new generation of Israel. This is according to the biblical principle that the children are always included in the father. This is the reason that the covenant made at Horeb included even those Israelites who had not yet been born at that time. In the sight of God, the covenant made at Horeb was actually made with the present new generation of Israel.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
