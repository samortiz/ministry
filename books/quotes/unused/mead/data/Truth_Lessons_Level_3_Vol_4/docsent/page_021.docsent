   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>E. Serving in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The believers should not only obey the church Matt 18:17 and meet with the church 1 Cor 14:23a, 26a ; they should also serve in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Serving in the church means serving in spirit and in coordination for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As Elders</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the church there are some brothers who serve as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the first local church, the church in Jerusalem Acts 8:1 , there were elders who took care of the administration of the church 11:30; 15:2, 4, 6, 22; 16:4; 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Acts 14:23 says that elders were appointed in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, there were elders in the church in Ephesus 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, Paul directed Titus to appoint elders in every city Titus 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The New Testament indicates that the elders were not voted in by their congregation but were appointed by the apostles according to the elders maturity of life in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They were charged by the apostles to care for the leadership and shepherding in their churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1 Peter 5:2 Peter charges the elders concerning the matter of shepherding: Shepherd the flock of God among you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Greek word rendered flock is literally little flock.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This refers to the church of God Acts 20:28 , which is little in number Luke 12:32 compared to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the church of God the elders are not rulers; they are shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes a shepherd may have to rule the flock, but such ruling is not the ruling of a king.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a ruling of someone who cares for the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Shepherding is to exercise a proper care over the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The flock needs to be cared for, protected, and led in the right direction.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They need to be brought to a place where they can eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, Peter does not tell the elders to shepherd their own flock.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He charges them to shepherd the flock of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The flock is not the elders possession but God s possession.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In a sense, the elders are employed by God to shepherd His flock.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the New Testament, an elder is called an overseer Phil 1:1; 1 Tim 3:2; 1 Pet 5:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Greek word for overseer is composed of over and seer, hence, overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>An overseer in a local church is an elder Acts 20:17, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The two titles refer to the same person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Elder denotes a person of maturity, and overseer denotes the function of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was Ignatius who in the second century taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From this erroneous teaching came the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This teaching is also the source of the episcopal system of ecclesiastical government.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Both the hierarchy and the system are abominable in the eyes of God.</S>
