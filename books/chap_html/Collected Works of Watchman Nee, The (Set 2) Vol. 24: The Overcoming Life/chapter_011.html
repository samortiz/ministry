<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TONE OF VICTORY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Psa. 20:5; 2 Chron. 20:1, 3, 12, 15, 17-22, 24, 26-28</H1><P>During the past few evenings, we have been considering the way for a Christian to overcome. Thank God that many brothers and sisters among us have entered into the experience of the overcoming life. Last night we saw the way for the overcoming life to grow. Today we will consider another subject, the tone of victory. Often a person sings with the right words but the wrong tone. Please remember that the overcoming life also has its tone. It is not enough for the words to be right; the tone must also be right. Today we will consider the meaning of the tone of victory.</P><P>Psalm 20:5 says, "May we shout victoriously in Your salvation." The word "salvation" can be translated as "victory" (see margin of ASV), and the words "shout victoriously" can be translated as "rejoice." There is no great difference between salvation and victory; they are merely two aspects of the same thing.</P><P>Thank the Lord that many brothers and sisters have passed through the gate of victory. But after one passes through this experience, he still needs to have the right tone of victory. You may not understand what is meant by the right tone. Perhaps I can put it another way: Victory has it benchmarks. How do you know that you have overcome? When do you know that you have overcome? You know that you have overcome by Psalm 20:5: "Shout victoriously in Your salvation."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br>VICTORY AND BOASTING IN VICTORY</H2><P>I wonder whether you know the difference between victory and boasting in victory. What is victory, and what is boasting in victory? Victory is something that Christ has done, and boasting in victory is something that we do. Victory is the work of Christ, while boasting in victory is our work. Victory tells us that the work is done and still prevailing, while boasting in victory is a continuous proclamation after the act of victory. I used to play cricket. It is a strenuous game; the ball is heavy, and the hands hurt after hitting the ball for awhile. One competes for an hour, sweating and striving; he hits the ball through one gate, another gate, and finally through the last gate. This is victory. When a team wins, the other classmates wave their flags and rejoice and shout. This is boasting in victory. The team wins the victory, but the other classmates boast in the victory. Thank God that victory is accomplished by Christ! We did not shed any blood for it. Yet we can boast in His victory.</P><P>Please remember that after a Christian has overcome, he should continue to exercise his mouth to boast in victory. A day without a hallelujah is a day without boasting in victory. If we only see rivers of tears daily, there is no boasting in victory. Our tone should be one that rejoices in His salvation, one that shouts victoriously in His victory. When our cricket team won, we brought the victory to our school, and our classmates boasted in this victory. In the same way, our Lord has won the victory and brought this victory to us. Now we can boast continuously in this victory.</P><P>We should say, "Hallelujah! Christ is Victor!" All those who cannot say hallelujah may not be defeated, but they certainly do not have the tone of victory. A man from Kiangsi may speak the Peking dialect. The words may be right, but the tone is wrong. Those who cannot say hallelujah have the wrong tone. We have to not only overcome but also have the right tone. If our tone is wrong, others will doubt whether we have overcome, and we also will doubt whether we have overcome. Peter's tone was that of a Galilean, and even a maid could detect it. When we lack the "Galilean" tone, our voice will betray our victory. Every day we need to have the "Galilean" tone. We should be identified as those who have followed Jesus, who have the "Galilean" tone.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BOASTING OF KING JEHOSHAPHAT</H2><P>In the Old Testament, there was a king of Judah by the name of Jehoshaphat. Let us read 2 Chronicles 20 to learn about his tone of victory.</P><P>At that time, "the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other besides the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle" (v. 1). At the time of Jehoshaphat, the kingdom of Judah was very weak and helpless in fighting against its enemies. Jehoshaphat was, of course, afraid when he looked at himself. He could do nothing before, and he could do nothing now. When the enemies came again, what could he do? He could do nothing.</P><P>Yet he was a man who feared God. He "set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah" (v. 3). He could do nothing except come to God. He prayed to the Lord, "O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee" (v. 12). He acknowledged his helplessness, and his eyes were set upon the Lord. Brothers and sisters, during the past few days, we have repeated the conditions for surrendering many times. They are: (1) to realize that we cannot make it, and (2) to stop trying to make it. We should also believe in God. This was what Jehoshaphat did. He acknowledged this by saying that he did not have the strength to withstand the enemy and did not know what to do. He could only look to the Lord.</P><P>God sent a prophet to him immediately, and said to him, "Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's" (v. 15). The battle is the Lord's! Victory or failure has nothing to do with us. Temper, pride, doubt, unclean thoughts, greed, and all kinds of sins have nothing to do with us. The battle is not ours, but God's. God has said, "Ye shall not need to fight in this battle" (v. 17). God only demands that we stand still. He wants us to put down our hands and leave everything up to Him. We only need to stand still and "see the salvation of the Lord" (v. 17). Brothers and sisters, we are not the ones who are fighting; we are the spectators. Whenever we stop boasting in victory, we fail. We do not have to be afraid before God, because He is the One who will battle for us.</P><P>Jehoshaphat did one thing more. He not only stood still and watched the battle, but he also fell down on his face to worship God when he heard the word of the prophet! All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem also fell before the Lord and worshipped Him. Others were joining hands to attack them, but what were they doing on their part? They asked a group of Levites to stand up to praise the Lord. They were "in holy array" (v. 21, ASV), and they went before the army to praise Jehovah. Were they crazy? They were not afraid of rocks and arrows; they were singing praises to God. This is the tone of victory. They had the tone of victory because they knew that Jehovah had given them the victory and that the enemies were already defeated. They knew that they had already won the battle. Some believe that when temptations come, they should struggle and withstand them. But God said, "And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten" (v. 22). Whenever songs of praises are sung to the Lord, the enemies are defeated.</P><P>What was the result? "And when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped" (v. 24). Either God does not give the victory at all, or He gives a victory in which no one escapes. If it were up to us, we might leave five or six persons behind. But God did not leave one. The words "when they began" in verse 22 are very meaningful. As the people were beginning to sing, the Lord set an ambush against the Ammonites, Moabites, and children of Mount Seir. Brothers and sisters, God can only work when we begin to praise. Whenever we begin to praise, God begins to work.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I know that we are faced with many temptations, and I know that we have many trials. There may be physical weaknesses, adverse circumstances, or various difficulties at work. We may say, "What should I do? How can I overcome?" Brothers and sisters, we know that we should overcome, but our tone is wrong. When temptations come, we should say, "Hallelujah!" When trials come, we should say, "Hallelujah!" When we see difficulties come, we should say, "Hallelujah!" Once we shout "Hallelujah," the enemies will be defeated. Whenever we praise, our God will begin to work. Once we begin to sing, He begins to work.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, it is not enough to acknowledge that we cannot make it, and it is not enough to believe that God can make it. We have to shout from our heart, "Hallelujah! Thank You God because I am under trials. Thank You God because I cannot make it. Thank You God because the victory is mine." Jehoshaphat continued to sing because he believed that he had overcome. In the eyes of Jehoshaphat, everyone was already a dead corpse. Consequently, he could go on and sing. He was not afraid of the rocks because he considered his enemies as already being dead. When they went up to the watchtower and looked, there were only dead bodies fallen to the earth.</P>
