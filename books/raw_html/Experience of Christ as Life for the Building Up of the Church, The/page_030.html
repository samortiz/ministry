<P>Then Paul said, "And moreover I show to you a most excellent way" (12:31b). There is something more excellent than the best gifts. The excellent way is love, which is fully defined in chapter thirteen. Speaking in tongues is listed last on Paul's positive lists. Then on his negative list in chapter thirteen, it is listed first. Verse 1 says, "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal." Sounding brass and a clanging cymbal give sounds without life. This is a genuine illustration of tongue-speaking.</P><P>Verse 2 says, "And if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing." Without love we are nothing. Verse 3 says, "And if I dole out all my possessions to feed others, and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love, I profit nothing." This shows that if we have the gifts or do anything without love, there is a great lack. We need the gifts plus love. In verse 8 Paul said, "Love never falls away. But whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless." Love never fails.</P><P>People always associate love with the heart. But Paul puts love with the spirit in 1 Corinthians. In 4:21 he spoke of coming to them either with a rod or in love and a spirit of meekness. Love is even deeper than the heart. Love is in the spirit, because it is in our spirit that Christ dwells. The real love, which is the expression of Christ, goes with our spirit because Christ is in our spirit. In 16:18 Paul said that his spirit had been refreshed. Then in verse 24 he said, "My love in Christ Jesus be with you all." His spirit was refreshed and his love was with them. Love goes along with our spirit. If our love is merely out of our heart, that is a natural love, not the divine love which is the expression of Christ. The love which is the expression of Christ comes out of our spirit.</P><P>In chapter fourteen Paul charges us, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy" (v. 1). This shows that the apostle Paul was a balanced person. He said to pursue love and desire spiritual gifts, but he made clear that we need to desire the best gift, which is to prophesy. The most important thing, however, is to pursue love. The Corinthians had the gifts but they were short of love in the spirit. Love is the very God embodied in Christ who lives in our spirit.</P>
