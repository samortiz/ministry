   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Letter from Brother Tang Shou-ling, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After I arrived in Shanghai, I intended to rest, but the work before me forced me to put myself to work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thank the Lord that He has given me the necessary strength.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The meeting here is under God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The sisters are living and fresh, and the brothers are improving.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A few brothers who were cold are now warmed up, and a few who were hardened are now softened by the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are waiting for a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Yu Cheng-hwa is burdened to finish the translation of the autobiography of Madam Guyon so that it can be printed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Chang Kwang-rong is in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He loves the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord willing, he and I will leave Shanghai in the near future to visit brothers and sisters elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Tang Shou-ling</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>June 1</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Compilation of Calendar with Daily Bible Reading One</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since I returned to Shanghai, my health has not been good; I have had two episodes of malaria attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The doctor examined my lungs and said that I have chronic pleurisy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because there was no suitable place to rest at home, I stayed in the hospital for eight days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The doctor only gave me some tonic food supplements for my pleurisy and something to help me sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Humanly speaking, this is a chronic illness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I do not know what God's will is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May the Lord be gracious to me so that I do not become loose or lazy and so that I know what to do on my bed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Please pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For a few months I have been burdened in my heart to compile a daily reading that contains a verse from the Scriptures and some words of exposition, which can be attached to a calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have made some preparations, but I realize that this is not an easy task.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that some brothers and sisters will have the burden to write something, and I will compile them together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no limit to the number of words; it can be three or four hundred words.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After we have decided on the content, we will do the editing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the writings are too long, we can print only the verses on the calendar and put the exposition in another book.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you think that this is a good idea?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May the Lord grant the brothers and sisters the burden, and please put the matter in your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Chou Shing-yi</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May 26</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A calendar with daily readings would surely be beneficial to the believers, but I do not know what Brother Chou's emphasis is.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I will only say a few things for his consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1 Rather than saying that you have a verse and an exposition, it is probably better to say that you have a verse and a little portion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The little portion can be a testimony, a story, a parable, or some words of comfort, encouragement, exhortation, and remembrance for the purpose of stirring up zeal or love or for the building up of faith or godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even if it is some kind of exposition, it should be for the nourishment of life and should be something that can be put into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if it does mention a subject like the rapture or the kingdom, its emphasis should not be on knowledge but on preparing others to meet the Lord and to seek after our kingship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Mere intellectual exposition, even if clear, logical, and accurate, will not create in the readers a hunger after righteousness or an urge to beseech Him on their knees.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>2 There should not be too many words for each portion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a daily portion is too long, it will not only confuse the simple ones but also be a headache for typesetting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The suggestion of putting the exposition in a book if it is too long misses the goal of the daily reading.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The intention of such a calendar is to provide something that catches people's eyes, without them having to spend much time in reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the ideal length would be one page per day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If there are too many words, we can use smaller type, and if the words are few, we can change to larger type.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In either case we should cover each day with only one page.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>3 The style should be simple and sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The worst kind of writing is that which does not say anything, that "moans without sickness," that plays with words or expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, if the text is 2 Corinthians 12:9, we can use the story of the brother who applied the truth of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Or if the text is John 3:16 and the emphasis is receiving eternal life through faith, we can put in the salvation story of Mr. Chapman.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the text is "Do not be slothful in zeal," we can say something like, "Just as a lazy man cannot be saved, so also a lazy believer cannot grow."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, in quoting stories or sayings of famous men, we must be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Anything we quote from memory is likely to contain mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If someone has passed through a crisis with the assistance of a verse, he can write a short testimony based on that verse.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Of course, the words simple and sincere are easy to say but hard to pen.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The only thing we can do is pray and carefully consider as we work, but not be careless and slovenly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>4 We also need to make some decisions as to the format of the layout.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the topics are to be cyclical, we should lay out the subjects, assign certain days to them, and put them out in cycles of days.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If there is to be a special line, such as an emphasis on the overcoming life, we need to put out related verses consecutively for a number of days and arrange them according to some kind of order.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The format also can be completely random.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The most important thing is to be living and fresh and not legal.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to pray while we work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Anything that is not produced from the Spirit is not spiritual and will not affect the spirits of others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Anything that is not from heaven will not receive blessings from heaven and will not lay up fruit in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May the One who started this work in your heart also accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Ruth Lee</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>June 29, in Wan County</S>
