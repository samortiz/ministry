   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Taking the Way of Submission</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to arrive at this recovery, God requires that there be the manifestation of authority among us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to take the way of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we submit, God will take the way of increase among us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The need today is that such a recovery be realized in us individually first.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to be an all-inclusive person, and we should have all-inclusive experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The gospel we preach should be an all-inclusive gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a man receives this gospel, not only are his sins forgiven, but he is brought into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do this, in a few years' time the condition of the church will be entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today, the responsibility rests entirely on us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Having the Body Consciousness</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What we need today is a Body consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The reality of the Body life lies in the Body consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is something that cannot be copied or imitated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Kuling, one brother asked what his future holds.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once this brother asked this question, his future was finished already.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Body we do not have an individual future; we only have the future of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We would rather be wrong in the Body than be wrong in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would rather submit to the Body than to seek for my personal future and offend the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>LEADING IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother David Hsu asked: How do I know that I will not lead others into mistakes?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Judgment of the Body Being More Reliable</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brother Nee: Actually, we are not aware of all the mistakes we make in our own lives.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who is responsible for these mistakes?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, we are responsible for them ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since we make mistakes in any case, I would rather make them in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is better to make mistakes in the Body than to make them in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If in the church today three or five people, or thirty or fifty people, know the will of God, and I do not have the right judgment concerning certain matters or persons, is it not better that I take their judgment than to make a judgment myself?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Body, sometimes we become more clear when we do not know something, and we become unclear when we know too much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When a judgment is made by the Body, the responsibility rests on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes when things happen to us and we are directly involved with them, we become affected by the factors involved and fail to have a clear discernment concerning the matters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the Body is not affected by personal factors.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not as easily influenced, and as such, its judgment is more reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not have any spiritual reality with us, these words may sound like the Catholic teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not have any spiritual reality, Catholicism will indeed come in. But if spiritual reality is with us, we will realize that no matter how good our personal judgments may be, they can never be compared to the judgments of those with spiritual discernment in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You cannot fight against the Body consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever you feel uncomfortable or uneasy, you have to give up and submit yourself to the Body.</S>
