   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BENEFITS OF BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHURCH IN THE HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to realize that the way the Lord is taking is to build up His church in the believers homes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once the church is built up in the homes, the homes will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The husbands and the wives might have been arguing couples, but once they have meetings in their homes, they will stop their arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The children will also be preserved from drifting with the current of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result, the family will become proper and normal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If possible, we should compile some material to teach the brothers and sisters how they should build up their own homes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, we should have something to teach them how to behave as parents, children, husbands, and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A book as spiritual as Ephesians contains teachings on being proper husbands, wives, children, parents, slaves, and masters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the past we were somewhat negligent in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the brothers and sisters devoted their attention to the big meetings and neglected the building up of the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the coming days we hope that we can compile some messages on the building up of the homes so that every saint s home would be a proper home.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once that happens, we can invite our relatives to the home meetings, and they will see the situation in our homes and will be touched to receive the Lord s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once we build up the church in the believers homes, we will be able to spread the gospel through the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the churches that do a good job with the homes will not need to have big gospel meetings; the gospel will spread spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The home is the place that touches man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It pierces and digs deep into man s very soul, even his very spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This does not mean that we cannot have big gospel meetings, but we need such meetings only a few times a year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The main emphasis with such meetings is in reaping, not sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The crucial thing is to build up the church in the homes and to spread the gospel through the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the same time, we need to encourage the brothers and sisters to group two or three families together into small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the small groups they should fellowship together and render spiritual help, nourishment, and care to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then in the larger church meetings there should be the teaching of Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such teaching is mainly for everyone to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we build up the church in such a well-coordinated way, the Lord will greatly bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE BENEFITS OF TRUTH LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What surprises me the most is that many dormant believers, including those in the United States, like Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some dormant saints in the church in Anaheim recovered their meeting in order to learn Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Right before this meeting, a few elders from Kaohsiung told me that before they started the truth classes, the number of people fluctuated very much.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But since they began the truth classes, more people are meeting steadily.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that man has the heart to know the truth and that Truth Lessons is truly being used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Timothy 2:4 says that God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we cannot tolerate to see a group of saved ones merely loving the Lord fervently but not knowing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must teach with Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After God s children are saved, if they pursue the truth, the church of the Lord will have a base and foundation and be built up in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After we have led the saints in this way, they will have the understanding to enter into the spiritual significance of the Bible and comprehend the revelation in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have all had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we were newly saved, we did not understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After we were taught for one or two years and learned some truths, we started to understand a little.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now the leading of the new way is to have home meetings, small group meetings, and truth classes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These three matters are like a threefold cord and are very powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through these three things we bring people to salvation, enable them to know and pursue life, and help them to enter into and be equipped with the truth so that they may have the way to life and the light of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A FIVE-YEAR PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>FOR THE GOSPELIZATION OF TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since October of 1984 we expected to begin a five-year plan for the gospelization of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now one and a half years have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This period of time can be regarded as a time of preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It may take us another year and a half to prepare.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First, we need to work out the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the truth classes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After we have established the homes, we will take the homes as the starting point to cooperate with the campus work in order to raise up full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the preparation period of three years, I hope that we will produce at least one thousand full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the fourth year, they will be formed into an army with ten people in a team.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These one hundred teams will set out together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Each team will work first in a town and then in the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They will stay in a town for at least three weeks or a month.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They will establish the church by preaching the gospel through door-knocking, establishing home meetings, and bringing ten to twenty people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then two full-timers will stay behind to continue to nourish, shepherd, and lead the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The other eight will come back, re-group with new full-timers, and set out for another town.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way, in fewer than four months we will gospelize all 318 towns throughout the island.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Later a team of six to eight people will re-group to work in the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then in a few years, Taiwan will not only be gospelized but also churchized.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There will be a church in every town and village as a shining testimony of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This plan is the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should not think that this is too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order to carry out this momentous task, the preparation work is more than crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should consider the kind of transportation the teams will need gospel vans, motorcycles, bicycles, or taking buses.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Before the full-timers set out for the towns, we must first rent houses for them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The location of the houses must be appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Moreover, the expenditure, realized in furnishing houses and providing the living expenses of the full-timers, will be very great and thus will require all the churches to prepare in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Before setting out in the fourth year, the full-time trainees who have graduated in the first three years should already be coordinating with the local saints to propagate in the communities of some major cities, such as Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At the present time they go door-knocking every Wednesday and Friday morning and visit people house to house in the apartment buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The result has been quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I believe that three years from now, when they propagate in towns and villages, they will already have some experience to establish a certain model in the communities.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>By this way, we hit two birds with one stone.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This five-year plan for the gospelization of Taiwan can be an easy task, but it all depends on the foundation we lay these first three years.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This foundation is the small group meetings, the home meetings, and the teaching of Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the reason that I want us all to aggressively learn, because what we are learning and working out is not only a foundation but a model.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I believe that if the full-timers seriously learn for half a year, when they go out, they will know how to set up and lead the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this way, once the move of the gospelization of Taiwan commences in the fourth year, we will march with strong morale to spread the gospel and the churches all over Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must be faithful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Those who should give their time must give their time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The young people especially need to give their time to God to receive His glorious commission.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After the gospel and the churches have spread all over Taiwan, they may be led by the Lord to continue to serve full time or to find a job.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But they need to be faithful to this military service in these five years until every town, village, and hamlet in Taiwan is gospelized.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>On the other hand, those who give financially must also be faithful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The monthly support for more than one thousand full-timers is considerable.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is in addition to the need for the churches and the spreading of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This requires all the saints to give joyfully and willingly in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we are faithful in these two matters, the Lord will definitely accomplish what we ask and think.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>FELLOWSHIP REGARDING</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>THE BUILDING OF THE BIG MEETING HALL Requiring Strong Faith and Adequate Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The purpose of building a big meeting hall in Lin-ko is not merely for our need locally but for the international gatherings in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This requires much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Regarding the international conferences, saints from different countries came to visit Taiwan in this past year because they wanted to find out about the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>There were hundreds from the United States who wanted to come, but I asked them not to come at the present time because our practice has not been fully developed.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Last week several saints from Germany visited, and there will be a few more coming this week.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>A continuous stream of saints is coming from places like Japan and Brazil.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Some American saints even have signed up to participate in the construction work of the big meeting hall when it begins.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>They all are professionals in building.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Hence, when we speak of the international need, we should never think that this is an exaggeration.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We are simply stating the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I hope that we will all have strong faith before the Lord to pray for this matter desperately.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Cooperating with the Lord s Move</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>to Gospelize the Whole Earth</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Moreover, after the construction of the big meeting hall, we will expand the size of the training.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>At that time more will come to the training.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We also thank the Lord that the international position of Taiwan has been raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The changes in the international situation are more favorable toward Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>These changes are sovereign of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If Taiwan now becomes the gospel center, Taiwan will be gospelized, and the gospelization will spread from Taiwan to the whole earth in cooperation with the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This term of the full-time training is approaching the end. In the coming term we will have classes for different languages, teaching the trainees a third foreign language other than English, such as Spanish and Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Now the need for Spanish is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Consider Central and South America for instance.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Even if we were to send three hundred co-workers there right now, it would not be sufficient to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>There are many needs all over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>After the gospelization of Taiwan, some may be sent to Japan, Europe, or Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Hence, I encourage the young people to advance in their studies.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>They not only need to know the truth and life, but they also need to learn more languages, including Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Many Christians confess, and even those in Christianity in America cannot deny, that the Lord has entrusted us with His truth in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This is an irrefutable fact.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We must bear the responsibility to spread the Lord s truth from Taiwan to every part of the world and raise up the Lord s testimony in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Therefore, the construction of the big meeting hall in Lin-ko is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Taiwan is the best location.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>I hope the co-workers, elders, and full-timers will have adequate prayer and will also explain this matter clearly to the saints in the different halls and churches so that they also will pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>I hope that all the churches in Taiwan will call on the Lord desperately for the sake of His interest on the earth to touch the government officials and grant the authorities the wisdom to see that this building will be beneficial to our nation, our people, our society, our economy, Taiwan s foreign relations, and even our people s foreign relationships, so that they will gladly and promptly grant us the permission to fulfill this matter.</S>
