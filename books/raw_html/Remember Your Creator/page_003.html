<h2 class=head1>KNOW THE BIBLE</h2><p>The second thing for you to do is to know the Bible in your childhood. Paul once wrote these words to Timothy: “And that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness.”<p>The sacred writings are the Scriptures, the Bible. From childhood we all have to know the Bible, which is able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.<h2 class=head1>A TWOFOLD CHARGE</h2><p>Here we have two portions of the Bible, and we are charged with two things: first, to remember your Creator in the days of your youth, and, second, to know the Bible in your childhood. In these verses, we have two points: concerning your Creator, concerning God, you have to remember Him; and concerning the Bible, you have to know it.<h2 class=head1>READ THE BIBLE</h2><p>The way to get to know the Bible is to read it. In your reading of the Bible, there are three points that will make your reading profitable.<p>In addition to reading the Bible, you have to love the Lord. This is the number one point. Unless you love the Lord, no light will come when you read the Bible. But when you do love the Lord and you read the Bible, the light comes and you see light in the Bible.<p>You have to read slowly and carefully. Don’t try to read too fast, and don’t take your reading too lightly.<p>You need to love the Lord, you need to read the Bible slowly and carefully, and you need to read the Bible with prayer. While you read the Bible, pray what you read. This is what we call pray-reading. You read and pray, and you pray what you read. Make the Bible verses you read your prayer. You don’t need to compose a prayer, but pray the verses you read. You may pray, “Lord, help me to remember You, to remember You in the days of my youth.” In this way, if you do mean business in reading the Word with prayer, you will gain a lot of profit from the Bible.<h2 class=head1>LOVE THE LORD NOW</h2><p>To remember the Lord is to love Him. You could never forget certain things or certain people that you love. To remember your Creator means to love the Lord in the days of your youth, while your eyes still have their keen sight, while your teeth are still complete and perfect, while you are still so strong, and while your hair is not gray. Don’t wait until it is too late to love the Lord, but love Him now, in the days of your youth.<h2 class=head1>A PRAYER</h2><p>“Lord, we thank You for all these young people. How we thank You, Lord, in Your recovery, You have gained so many young ones. We thank You for all these young ones. They do love You and they do love the ministry. They like to serve You in the sending out of Your Word.<p>“Lord, we pray this morning that they would really remember You, remember You by loving You, that no one among them would remember You too late. Lord, we pray that they all would love You right now, right now in the days of their youth, that they would also like to study the Bible, to know the Word in their childhood.<p>“Lord, we present, we offer, and we consecrate all these dear young ones this morning to You. Lord, we believe they are in Your hands. Lord, take hold of all of them, and Lord, keep them all the days in the future in Your hands, in Your grace, even, Lord, in Your church, in the recovery. We ask this in Your precious name.”
