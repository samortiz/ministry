   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BIND THE STRONG MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Matthew 12:29 the Lord Jesus said that unless the strong man is bound, no one can enter his house and plunder his vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are going to plunder his vessels, even all his house, we must first bind the strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The strong man is Satan, and Satan is in our physical body, endeavoring to control our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to bind Satan, the strong man, in the human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we can plunder his vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the brothers who bear responsibility in the churches must realize that most of the problems in the churches come from the brothers' and sisters' minds.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the Bible, the church which had the most problems was the church at Corinth, and the main reason for the problems was the dissenting opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The opinions, of course, are problems in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, Paul wrote that they needed to be attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion 1 Cor 1:10, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>. Although all the saints need to be attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion, the leading brothers must also fight the battle in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They must not argue with people, but pray specifically, "Lord, bind the strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Bind the strong man in the dissenting thoughts of the dear saints!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>O Lord, we can do nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We ask You to bind the strong man!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The thoughts of the sisters are touchy and the thoughts of the brothers are explosive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you touch the thoughts, you will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The best way is not to touch the thoughts, but to touch the throne of authority and bind the strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once the strong man has been bound, you can plunder his vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, you will see that all the dear brothers and sisters will be helped one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They will not be helped by your arguing or convincing, but by the binding of the strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a problem arises in the church, never touch the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Always touch the throne, asking the Lord to bind the strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a matter of the kingdom the kingdom of Satan or the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The mind is the battlefield, and we all must fight the battle to capture the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Second Corinthians 4:4 says that the god of this age has blinded the minds of those who do not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Satan's tactic is to constantly blind people's minds.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to pray to bind the strong man, to bind the god of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ephesians 4:17-18 speaks of the "vanity of their mind."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The worldly people walk in the vanity of their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything in their mind is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 18 uses another term, "darkened in their understanding."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The understanding of the worldly people has been darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Also, there is a third term, "the hardness of their heart."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In these two verses we see the vanity of the mind, the darkened understanding, and the hardness of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose your mind were filled with vanity, your understanding were darkened and your heart were hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a pitiful person you would be!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only are the worldly people like this today, but also many Christians are exactly the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Their minds have been filled with vanity, their understanding has been fully darkened, and their heart has been totally hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What shall we do about this?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must pray to bind the strong man, and then we can plunder all his vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The vessels are God's vessels, but they have been usurped by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we must rescue them for the kingdom by binding the strong man.</S>
