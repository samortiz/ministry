   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR THINGS TO BE DIFFERENTIATED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here we have to consider again the four things mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They are the four things that must be distinguished one from the other, which we mentioned earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a man wants to understand salvation, first, he has to differentiate between the genuine Christian and the false Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, he must differentiate between the discipline of the believers and eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eternal salvation is one thing, and God's discipline of His children is another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is one thing for a Christian to be chastised in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is another thing for an unbeliever to perish in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A Christian will not perish eternally, but he can be chastised.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are many verses that speak of chastisement for a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One cannot apply these verses to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Third, there is a great difference between the kingdom and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, there is a great difference between reward and gift.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is one thing for you to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is another thing for you to reign, to rule, and to share the glory with the Lord Jesus in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are many places in the Bible that speak about a person being removed from the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because many are not clear about the difference between the kingdom and eternal life, the reward and salvation, they apply the verses on the kingdom to the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many think that to be removed from the kingdom means to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These, however, are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A Christian can lose his position in the kingdom, but a Christian cannot lose his position in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although a Christian can lose his position of reigning together with Christ, he cannot lose his position of being a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Fourth, not only does the Bible say that a Christian will suffer discipline today, and not only does it say that some Christians can lose the kingdom, but there are definite punishments for a Christian in the kingdom as well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible says that many Christians will suffer discipline in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They will lose the reward in the coming age and will also suffer punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A Christian can lose his reward in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He can also be punished with definite, positive punishments.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But one cannot mix the punishment in the millennium with eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eternal perdition is one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chastisement in the kingdom is another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When a Christian is chastised, it does not mean that he will perish eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Salvation is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Chastisement is only a discipline in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If some children cannot be disciplined well in this age, they will be disciplined in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, there are four things here that must be distinguished one from the other.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The four things, the false Christians, the chastisement in this age, the losing of the kingdom, and the punishment in the millennium, are different from eternal life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us now consider the first group, the false Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second Peter 2:1 says, "But there arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some would ask if this verse indicates that a Christian can perish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The ones mentioned here are those that have been bought by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some will say that this verse obviously says that a Christian can perish, because it says here that they have followed the heresies and have denied the Master who bought them, and their end is swift destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But please remember a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here it mentions the Master who bought them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word bought is used in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Does the word convey the sense that the bought ones are the saved ones?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If these bought ones are the saved ones, then we have to admit that a saved person can perish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if this word has a different meaning, then one cannot say this any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is true that the Bible tells us that we are bought by the Lord with a price.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we have to see the scope of what the Lord Jesus bought on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Did He buy the believers only, or did He buy the whole world?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From the Bible we can see that the Lord did not buy the believers only, but He bought the whole world as well.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Matthew 13:44 says, "The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and in his joy goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This shows us that the Lord Jesus sold whatever He had to buy the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But not only did He buy the treasure, He bought the field as well.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The treasure is a small part, but the field is a big part.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The treasure is in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to obtain the treasure, the Lord bought the whole field.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The purpose of buying the field was not for the field, but for the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Please remember that the purpose of the Lord's buying was for the small part, but He bought the big part.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His purpose is to get the treasure, but the scope of His buying was the field.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those in the kingdom of the heavens are the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But what the Lord bought was the field.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, we cannot say that everyone that is bought by the Lord is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The scope of buying is greater than the scope of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The work of buying and redemption on His cross is different from His work of substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord's substitution is only for all the believers, but He died for the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He made the scope wide enough.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But this does not mean that the whole world is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If Peter were to change a word here, if he were to say "denying the Master who saved them," then it would be very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But Peter has used a big enough word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He said "denying the Master who bought them."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, we can see that this group of people has not been saved at all.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This word bought is a very broad word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By this word alone, one cannot say that they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Second, the word Master, despotes, here is not a common word either.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It should not be translated as lord, but should be translated as master.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is not the Lord as in the Lord Jesus, but the Master as one who has temporal control of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It refers to an earthly master.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is no life relationship here.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>According to a strict interpretation of the Bible, this is not a relationship between them and the Lord, but a relationship between them and their master.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, this group of people has not been saved at all.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>No one can say, Jesus is Lord, except in the Holy Spirit, for whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>These ones are like Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They have never confessed Jesus as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Third, Peter tells us that this group of people are the false teachers and the false believers.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Peter also told us that there were false prophets among the people.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He also said that there will be false teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>These false prophets refer to the false prophets in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All the readers of the Bible know that no false prophet in the Old Testament was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We can say boldly that this group of people have not been saved at all.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They followed their cleverness and their ideas, secretly bringing in destructive heresies, and even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Hence, 2 Peter 2:1 does not refer to the perdition of the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There are more words in the Bible like these.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>All of them refer to the nominal believers.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They do not refer to the perdition of the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Some have argued about a few words at the end of chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Verse 20 says, "For if, having escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ but having again been entangled in these, they are defeated, the last state has become worse for them than the first."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Verse 22 says, "It has happened to them according to the true proverb: The dog has turned to its own vomit, and the washed sow to wallowing in the mud.'"</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Based on the words of verse 20, some have thought that these ones refer to the saved ones, because it says plainly that these ones have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; surely such ones were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But please note that Peter was very careful in the way he spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Verse 20 says that these ones have the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and that they have escaped the defilements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But verse 22 tells us who these people really are.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If there were only verse 20, we might think that these are the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But if we read verse 22, we will know who they are.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>"It has happened to them according to the true proverb: The dog has turned to its own vomit, and the washed sow to wallowing in the mud.'"</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It says that although these ones have escaped the defilements of the world, and outwardly they have the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they were later entangled again, and their last state has become worse.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>These people are simply dogs and sows.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The Lord Jesus has never said that He gives to His dogs eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Nor has He ever said that His dogs will never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The Lord said that He gives eternal life to the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He never mixes the sheep with the dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He cannot say that He gives eternal life to the sows and the dogs, nor can He say that the sheep have been entangled by the defilements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>These two kinds of people can never be mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Many who have heard the gospel would say that Jesus is Lord and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>They can quickly tell you about doctrines related to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Outwardly they do not have any defilements.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But actually they have never been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>They have never received the Lord and have never experienced the Lord living in them.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>They only confess the Lord temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>They have removed a little of the outward defilements.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>But when sentiments change, they go back to their old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The last state of this kind of people is worse than their first state.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>These are not the sheep at all.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>They are the dogs and the sows.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Because they are the dogs, they turn to their own vomit.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Because they are the sows, they wallow in the mud after they have been cleansed without.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>This does not mean that Christians will not sin, and it does not mean that they will not touch the mud or wallow in the mud.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>A Christian may touch the mud; he may wallow in the mud.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>But for a Christian to wallow in the mud is an uncomfortable thing.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>If he is comfortable in wallowing in it, then he has to be a sow.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>A Christian could perhaps also swallow his own vomit.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>But he will feel that it is repulsive, and he will be uncomfortable if he does that.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>This is the difference between the sow, the dog, and the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>One has to identify clearly the nature of the dog and the sow.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>In the Bible, sows and dogs refer to the unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>They do not refer to the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>If a person is a sheep, he will never perish.</S>
