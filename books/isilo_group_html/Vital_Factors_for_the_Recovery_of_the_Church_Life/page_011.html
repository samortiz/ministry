<p>The Spirit is the realization of Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God (John 14:17-20; Col. 2:9). Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. The entire Triune God is embodied in Christ, and this Christ is fully realized as the Spirit.</p>
<p>As the embodiment of the Triune God, Christ went through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and entered into resurrection. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). According to 2 Corinthians 3:17, today, after His resurrection, that is, after His glorification (Luke 24:26, 46), Christ is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Since the Spirit is the full realization of Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, the Spirit is simply the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. After passing through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Triune God in Christ became such a life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit entered into us as our life and essence, and He also came upon us as our power for His economy. Now we are one with the Triune God, who is the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FACTOR OF THE DIVINE LIFE</h2>
<p>At this point we need to consider what is the divine life. As I mentioned previously, when the Triune God moves, He is the Spirit. Eventually, this Spirit comes into us to live within us. When He lives within us, He is the divine life. When God moves, He is the Spirit; when God lives in us, He is the divine life.</p>
<p>Thus far we have covered the first three factors for the recovery of the church life. These three factors are Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life. Christ is God embodied, the Spirit is God moving, and the divine life is God living in us. Hallelujah! We have Christ as the embodiment of God, we have the Spirit as God moving, and we have the divine life as God living within us.</p>
<p>Since we have the divine life, by what life should we live? We all need to realize that if we live by our natural life, practically speaking we are outside the church. I was born a typical Chinese. However, I do not live by the Chinese life, but by the divine life. This divine life is simply God living in us.</p>
<p>The church is a group of people living by the divine life. This divine life is simply the all-inclusive Spirit living in the believers. This all-inclusive Spirit is the realization of the all-inclusive Christ, and the all-inclusive Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God. Therefore, the church is the manifestation, the expression, of the Triune God (1 Tim. 3:15-16). Thus, we have Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life as three vital factors for the recovery of the church life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Vital Factors for the Recovery of the Church Life &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
