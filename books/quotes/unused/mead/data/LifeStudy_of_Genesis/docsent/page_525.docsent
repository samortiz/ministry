   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>d Joseph Having Two Dreams that Caused His Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Hate Him More</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Joseph had two dreams that caused his brothers to hate him even more vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>5-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These dreams came from God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There were two dreams because two is the number of confirmation and testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both dreams refer to one thing, for both the sheaves and the stars bowed down to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In our eyes Joseph's brothers, being adulterers, fornicators, murderers, and haters, should have been condemned to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But Joseph did not dream about thorns and robbers surrounding a gentle teenager.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, he dreamed of sheaves and stars.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A sheaf is a bundle into which wheat is bound after reaping.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that, in God's eyes, Jacob's sons were His crop on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, they were not a green crop; they were a ripened and harvested crop that had been bound into sheaves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the second dream the members of Joseph's family are signified by the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were bright lights shining in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have pointed out in the life-study of Revelation that the sun, the moon, and the stars in Revelation 12 and Genesis 37 represent the totality of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During Joseph's time, his family was the totality of God's people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to our view, they were evil and dirty, but according to God's view, they were bright and heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, according to our human nature, we are ugly, evil, and unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, we have been chosen, redeemed, forgiven, regenerated, and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we are God's farm, God's crop.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, we shall be God's harvest; we shall be reaped by Him and become sheaves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, we are heavenly lights.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What a vision this is!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God was sovereign in giving Joseph these dreams, for they reveal the nature, the position, the function, and the goal of God's people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's people are His harvest and His lights.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the harvest, they have life, and as the heavenly hosts, they have light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the first dream there is life, and in the second, light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Life and light are two characteristics of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the first dream the sheaves bowed down to Joseph's sheaf, and in the second, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Joseph told his father and brothers about his second dream, Jacob rebuked him and said, "What is this dream that thou has dreamed?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?" v. 10 . Joseph was not political; rather, he was genuine, frank, faithful, and straight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If he had not frankly told them about his dreams, there would have been no problem with this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the church life we should be like Joseph, not like politicians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, not many among us are frank, straight Josephs; instead, most of us are "wise" politicians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may have a dream, but you would never tell others about it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Joseph on the contrary was genuine, frank, open, and transparent; he was happy to tell his brothers about his dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But this provoked their hatred even more, and Joseph's transparency caused him to be "crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many times I also have been "crucified" for my transparency.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if I become political, I shall no longer be like Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Humanly speaking, Joseph was wrong in telling his brothers about his dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we had been Joseph, many of us probably would have said, "You know, I had a good dream last night."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When others asked us about the dream, we would say, "Forgive me, I can't tell you about it."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the political "wisdom" of today's Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Will you be a politician or a Joseph?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you are a Joseph, you will be "crucified" for your frankness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because of Joseph's dreams, his brothers hated him more than ever.</S>
