   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONSIDERING HOW TO USE THE MYSTERY OF HUMAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You have to consider the use of The Mystery of Human Life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is it practical in your gospel situation?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You must study its use.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Opening with The Mystery of Human Life might be quite good for certain persons, but I do not believe it is appropriate for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, you have to consider how to use it for the greatest profit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose you feel to use The Mystery of Human Life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Still you have to study to determine how to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It may be best to speak in this way: "Sir, here is a book in my hand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It talks about something marvelous which I would like to share with you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What it talks about is the mystery of our human life."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of application is very understandable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>APPROACHING GOSPEL PREACHING AS A SCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As I have told you before, you should not consider gospel preaching an easy task.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, it is like a difficult scientific course.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The classroom training helps only to open the door of this wide field.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From there, you must enter through the door and begin to consider, day and night, how to carry out your scientific research.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To preach theology or biblical knowledge is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The only way that works is to make the message practical.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the secret you all must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF BIBLICAL POINTS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to consider how to make all the biblical points practical.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have used marriage life as an example in quite a few of my messages.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This makes the message more practical.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you are going to reach certain persons, first of all, you must know their real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you are going to help those in high school or junior high, you must learn their real life situation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, you have to consider what portion of the holy Word can be applied to that particular situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must have some verses or portions in the Bible as the base of your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The basic thoughts in the Bible are the top ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No logic can exceed the logic of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When your preaching is based on the Bible, your preaching will become powerful, yet it must be practical.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have to speak on the practical situation but with some portions or some verses from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the third point is to learn to speak in a way that is always practical.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you take care of these three points, you will be able to learn a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>PREACHING TO OUR RELATIVES AND FRIENDS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is hard to say whether it is easier to talk to a person whom you know or to a person whom you do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may have relatives whom we have known from our youth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because we know them so well, we may not know how to talk to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our knowledge of them may hinder our ability to talk with them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes it is rather hard for us to preach the gospel to our relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It may be better to ask some sisters or brothers who do not know our relatives to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There may be more impact in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have much to learn in order to preach the gospel effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are going to speak to someone whom we have known for several years, we can exercise to speak to him as though we do not know him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we can speak something new, fresh, and particular to him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we know a person so well, sometimes it is hard to know the best subject to use.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the person is proud, it is best not to talk about being proud.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It may be better to talk about the Lord Jesus or even about the danger of the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That might have more impact.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we know the person so well, and he realizes that he is a proud person, he may not want us to bring up such a subject.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A strong reason that we are not always effective in preaching the gospel to our relatives is because we know them so well.</S>
