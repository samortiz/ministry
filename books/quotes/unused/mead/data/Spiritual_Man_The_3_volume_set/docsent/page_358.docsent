   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE OF PAUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we accept the biblical teaching that our body is a member of Christ, we also have to take the teaching that Christ's life flows inside of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The life of Christ flows from the Head to His Body, imparting life, vitality, and liveliness to it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since our body is a member of that Body, it certainly follows that this life will flow into it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet this life is received only by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The amount of life we receive depends on the degree of faith we exercise in appropriating that life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the Bible we have seen that the life of the Lord Jesus can be applied to and received by the believers' body, but this cannot be done without faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many believers may be astonished when they first hear such a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we must not understate the explicit teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we look into Paul's own experience, we will see the preciousness and reality of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2 Corinthians 12 the apostle Paul mentioned the condition of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He told us that he had a thorn in his flesh and that he entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness" v. 9a . Therefore the apostle said, "Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me...for when I am weak, then I am powerful" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>9b-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What was the thorn in the apostle's flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can bypass this question for now since the Bible does not answer it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But one thing is certain: this thorn in the flesh had the effect of weakening his body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The original word for weakness refers to weakness in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The same word is used in Matthew 8:17.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even the Corinthians knew that the apostle's body was weak 2 Cor 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The apostle himself said that when he was first with them, he was in weakness 1 Cor 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This does not mean that the apostle was lacking in spiritual power, for both the first and the second Epistles sufficiently reveal that he was full of spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, the word "weakness" is the same word used to describe the physical weakness mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is also used in two other passages to indicate the dying condition of the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, from these verses we can see the apostle Paul's physical condition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His original physical condition was very weak, but did he always stay weak?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No. He tells us that the power of Christ rested upon him to make him strong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should pay attention to the "principle of contrast."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The thorn never left Paul, and neither did the weakness that came with the thorn; yet the power of Christ rested upon his weak body and enabled him to meet every need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The power of Christ was in contrast to the weakness of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This power did not take away the thorn or remove the weakness, but it lived in Paul, dealing with everything that his weak body could not handle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This may be likened to a wick that burns with a flame but is not consumed because the lamp is full of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The wick is still very weak, but the oil supplies everything that the flame requires of it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we see the principle of God's life being our body's strength.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His life does not change the weak and mortal nature of our body; rather, it saturates the body with what it cannot provide.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, according to his natural condition, Paul was the weakest, but according to the power he received from Christ, he was the strongest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The strength mentioned in this portion of the Bible specifically refers to the apostle's body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We know how the apostle Paul worked continually day and night, laboring mentally and physically, doing a work that even three or four strong men could not handle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If his weak body had not received the Holy Spirit's enlivening, how could it have borne so much burden?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a definite fact that God gave strength to Paul's body.</S>
