<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF CHRIST<br>BECOMING HIS DIVINE INCREASE</H2><P>The result of this enjoyment of the divine dispensing of Christ is that we become His divine increase. This can be seen from five aspects. First, through regeneration we are produced to be the children of God and the brothers of Christ, becoming the members of His Body and constituted to be His Body (John 3:3-5; 1:12-13; Heb. 2:11-12; Rom. 12:5). This Body is the fullness of Christ, which also is His increase. Second, the regenerated ones are constituted to become the bride of Christ as His counterpart to be His increase (John 3:3-5, 22-30). God has regenerated us by His Spirit, so that we have His eternal life. Furthermore, He has filled us with His immeasurable Spirit, so that we can become the bride of the all-inclusive Christ who is above all and can become His divine increase.</P><P>Third, as those who have received the life of Christ, we have become His sheep, enjoying Him as the pasture and becoming His flock, which is the church (John 10:10b-11, 14-16; Acts 20:28). The Lord forsook His soul life to accomplish redemption for His sheep, so that we can partake of God's life and by it be brought into one flock to be the increase of Christ. Fourth, the ones who have received the resurrection life of Christ, as the grains produced through His dispensing, become the bread, which is His Body (John 12:24). The Lord is the one divine grain. Through His death and resurrection, He released the divine life to produce many grains as His increase for the expression of His glory. Fifth, the believers who are joined to Christ and who are His branches dispense Him to others, making them the fruit, the organism of the processed Triune God, having Him as the definite expression (John 15:1, 5, 8, 16a). To bear fruit is to dispense to others the Christ that we have received, so that they would become the branches of the Lord as the true vine and would become the increase of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DEFINITE STEPS IN DISPENSING<br>THIS CHRIST TO OTHERS</H2><P>We are all branches of the Lord, and we have been sent forth by Him to bear fruit. As such we should dispense Christ to others. Here we have listed seven definite steps:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Every Morning Being Revived,<br>Taking Two or Three Verses<br>as Spiritual Food to Enjoy Christ</H2><P>In order to dispense Christ to others, the first thing to do is to be revived every morning. We should get up early every morning, and before we do anything else, we should spend ten to twenty minutes to pray-read two or three verses from a selected book of the Bible. We should read and pray, and we should turn what we read into prayer. In this way, we will mingle the Lord with His word and will receive Him into us. By this, we will enjoy the Christ in the word as our spiritual food.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Every Day Overcoming,<br>Taking the Word We Have Thoroughly Enjoyed<br>as the Supporting Strength</H2><P>As long as we are definitely revived this way, every day we will have two or three verses in us. Even if we cannot memorize them, it is still good if we can copy them on a piece of paper and carry it around with us. We can go over them again and again for our instant supply. When we have these two or three verses for our supporting strength, we can live an overcoming life every day.</P>
