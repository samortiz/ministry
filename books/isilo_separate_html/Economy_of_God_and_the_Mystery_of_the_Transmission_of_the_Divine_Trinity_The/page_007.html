This word is used in the New Testament with this meaning only by the apostle Paul. In Luke 16 when the Lord Jesus spoke about the unrighteous steward, He used this word, which in these verses is translated stewardship (vv. 2-4). A form of this word is also used in 1 Peter 4:10 where it is translated as stewards. However, in these two portions of the Scriptures this word does not bear much significance. Therefore, in the New Testament Paul is the only one who used this term from the viewpoint of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. He used it three times-twice in Ephesians (1:10; 3:9) and once in 1 Timothy (1:4)-with direct reference to God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<p>Although Paul referred to God&#8217;s New Testament economy in 1 Timothy, it was still in relation to the church in Ephesus. In 1 Timothy 1:3-4, Paul said to Timothy, &#8220;I exhorted you...to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things...rather than God&#8217;s economy, which is in faith.&#8221; Therefore, we can see that the three times Paul used this word in direct reference to God&#8217;s New Testament economy were all concerning the church in Ephesus. He used it twice in Ephesians, speaking directly to the church in Ephesus, and once in 1 Timothy, speaking in relation to the church in Ephesus. In other words, God&#8217;s speaking in the New Testament concerning His New Testament economy was altogether directed to the church in Ephesus. This is very meaningful.<h2 class=head1>THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD ECONOMY</h2><p>The Greek word for economy is composed of two words. The first word oikos means &#8220;house&#8221; or &#8220;home,&#8221; denoting a household or a dwelling place; the second word nomos means &#8220;law.&#8221; When these two words are combined together, it means &#8220;household law,&#8221; and it may be explained further to mean &#8220;household administration.&#8221; Hence, the word economy means &#8220;household law,&#8221; &#8220;household management,&#8221; or &#8220;household administration.&#8221; Since it is a household administration, it implies an arrangement or a plan. Since the household administration is to enforce the household rules, naturally it has an arrangement with a plan. Since it is an arrangement or a plan, there must also be a purpose.<h2 class=head2>The Usage of Dispensation (&#8220;Age&#8221; or &#8220;Arrangement&#8221;) in Theology</h2><p>When there is an arrangement or a plan, there is a purpose, and this arrangement or plan with a purpose constitutes a household administration. The arrangement of a household administration is mainly for distributing. What does it distribute? It distributes the riches of the family for the family&#8217;s use. This word was used in relation to the big families in ancient times, which were similar to big Chinese households composed of a whole clan living together. When a big clan lives together, surely there are household laws and regulations, and surely there is the arrangement of the household administration. This arrangement is mainly to distribute the riches of the family for the living of the family members. This kind of distribution is a &#8220;dispensing.&#8221; From the word disensing comes another word-dispensation, denoting the dispensation of economy. But when this word is used in theology to explain theological doctrines, it is usually understood as &#8220;age&#8221; or &#8220;period.&#8221;<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
