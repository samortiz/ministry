   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO A TALK WITH CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM HONG KONG AND CANTON 2 Date:Tuesday evening, August 30, 1949</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Canton THE CONDITION OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND THE MANIFESTATION OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mrs. Weigh: I feel weak physically all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This frustrates my spiritual walk.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How can I know the resurrection power of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Watchman Nee: Your problem does not lie in your question.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to realize that the life of Christ which a Christian expresses is not limited by time, environment, or conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A healthy person can manifest the life of Christ through his health.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A normal person can manifest the life of Christ through his normal condition, and a sick person seriously ill in bed can also manifest the life of Christ through his trying condition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>True spirituality is not affected by any kind of condition at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is wrong to think that a person only can live a proper spiritual life when everything is in order.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If there is no hope, one should not cherish unreal expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You do not need to wait for your health to get better to live the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A busy mother does not have to wait until all her ten children are grown up before she pursues a spiritual walk.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A busy shopkeeper does not have to wait until he is the boss of his business before he can serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A single man does not have to wait until he is married to serve the Lord without distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the same token, those who have a wife should not think that it is easier to live the Christian life by being single.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some have good health, yet they do not manifest the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows that expressing this life does not require a certain, set environment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One can express the life of Christ in strength, in weakness, or in a normal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some people think that they have to wait for the environment to change for the better before they can live a proper spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is like those who say that they will believe in Jesus only if their circumstances change for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They say they will believe if they sin less or if they become more moral.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We would exhort such ones not to wait; they can believe in Jesus in spite of their present condition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Enoch walked with God for three hundred years and begot sons and daughters Gen 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus also told us that those who will be raptured will not be taken at the time they are reading the Bible or praying but while they are in the field and grinding at the mill Matt 24:40-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These verses show us that there is no need to have a new environment or a certain set of conditions to express the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not cherish false hopes or think that we can live a spiritual life only when our environment is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today the Lord is sovereign over our physical condition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether our condition is good or bad, His intention is that we express His life through it so that this life will prove to be victorious over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The so-called discipline of the Holy Spirit is carried out in this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord's intention is that we do our best to express His life in the midst of these very circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You are physically weak and cannot be too active, but you should not be condemned in your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Outward activities can decrease, but your fellowship with the Lord and your contact with Him should not decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your touch with God cannot diminish in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are so weak that you cannot make it to the meeting, simply stay at home as long as you are clear within that this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You must be persuaded and convinced within yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul said in Ephesians 2 that God has raised us up with Christ and seated us together with Christ in the heavenlies v. 6 . This word means that a believer receives a transcendent life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It would be wonderful if God granted you the grace of a sanguine and healthy body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if He does not give you a healthy body, and instead leaves you as you are, you should humble yourself before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and it is upon you so that you will learn to express the transcendent life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hebrews 6 says that God's children can have a taste of the power of the age to come v. 5 . Indeed, today we should enjoy God's divine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, we should believe Him even when He does not heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus did not promise to heal Paul's thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead, He promised him sufficient grace 2 Cor 12:7-9 , which is actually the resurrection power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One can only experience this sufficient grace when there is a thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Generally speaking, it is easy for a new believer to experience healing through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is not because his faith is greater than that of more mature ones; it is because the Lord wants him to know Him as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A long-time believer, however, may not receive healing so readily.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In fact, often it is very hard for him to receive healing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This does not prove that his faith is small.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It merely means that the Lord has a higher standard for him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is like the experience of leading men to salvation; it is easy for a new believer to witness for the Lord and to bring men to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is hard for a long-time believer to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Like the disciples, he has to pray earnestly for ten days before he can lead someone to the Lord Acts 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In some cases, healing depends on the atmosphere at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During a time of revival, outward miracles usually accompany God's presence, and it is easy to experience healing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, immediately after Pentecost, Peter and John healed the lame man lying at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful Acts 3:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even their shadow became a means of healing to others 5:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, God's salvation not only heals the body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It mainly heals man's soul and spirit so that he can have a rich entrance into God's kingdom 2 Pet 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Paul's handkerchiefs and aprons were able to heal people Acts 19:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet when Timothy was sick, Paul did not send his handkerchief or apron to cover Timothy's stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the contrary, he advised Timothy to use regular means 1 Tim 5:23 .</S>
