   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first five commandments, based on Jehovah God's uniqueness and jealousy, demand man to honor, serve, and love God as the unique and jealous God Exo 20:3-12 .</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that, as children, we need to realize that our parents are our source, and as our source they should be considered God's representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the commandment concerning honoring our parents is ranked with the first four commandments concerning God and His Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To disobey, dishonor, despise, and do evil to our parents means that we reject God.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the Ten Commandments had not been given to us, our actual situation and condition could not be exposed to ourselves, and we would not be clear concerning ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But through the trial of keeping the commandments of the law, our nature, situation, and condition are exposed and become clear to us.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man Being Fleshy, Sold under Sin</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whereas the law is holy, righteous, good, and spiritual, man is fleshly, even fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the reason Paul says, "I am fleshy, sold under sin" Rom 7:14b .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul realized that he was contrary to all that was portrayed by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He also portrayed man as being fleshy and, having lost his liberty, as being sold under sin.</S>
