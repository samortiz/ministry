   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE PRAISE OF A SAINT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS GOING UP TO ZION CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>JEHOVAH'S DELIVERANCE OF HIM FROM HIS DISTRESS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 120 is the praise of a saint in his going up to Zion concerning Jehovah's deliverance of him from his distress.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. The Fifteen Psalms of Ascents</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being the Favorites of Hezekiah's Singing</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to history, Psalms 120 to 134, fifteen Psalms of Ascents, were the favorites of Hezekiah's singing cf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isa 38:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He used to sing these psalms with stringed instruments in the temple at Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. Meshech, a Place Far to the North in Assyria,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>and Kedar, a Place to the South in Arabia</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Psalm 120:5 says, "Woe is me, for I sojourn in Meshech,/I dwell among the tents of Kedar."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we have two proper nouns Meshech and Kedar referring to two places.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Meshech was a place far to the north in Assyria, and Kedar was a place to the south in Arabia Isa 21:13, 16; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>27:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both may refer to the places in which the psalmist was captured in the Assyrian invasion 2 Kings 18:11; 2 Chron 32:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that Psalm 120 is related to the Assyrian invasion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Assyrians invaded Israel and took the capital of Israel, Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The writer of this psalm was among the captives in Meshech and Kedar.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. The Psalmist's Suffering of Afflictions</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>in Captivity</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How could a godly Israelite have been in Meshech, a place far to the north, and in Kedar, a place to the south?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The answer must be that the psalmist was among the godly Jews who had been taken into captivity by the Assyrians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The "distress" in verse 1 may refer to the suffering of afflictions in the psalmist's captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here the psalmist said, "In my distress I called out to Jehovah,/And He answered me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 6 may indicate that his captivity was for a long time: "Long has my soul had its dwelling/With him who hates peace."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who hated peace were first the Assyrians and later the Babylonians and the Persians, both of whom invaded Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The invading Assyrians were not for peace but for war.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, in verse 7 the psalmist went on to say, "I am for peace; but when I speak,/They are for war."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because these invaders also were liars, the psalmist prayed, "O Jehovah, deliver my soul from lying lips,/From a tongue of deceit" v. 2 . The first of the Psalms of Ascents, therefore, describes the suffering of the psalmist in his captivity.</S>
