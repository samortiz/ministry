   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Preparing to Prophesy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second item of service in the new way is also a very difficult thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is to prepare to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the church meeting, the most precious thing is the prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This matter happened briefly like the blossoming of an overnight flower in the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During the Apostles time, it appeared for a short while.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But after the Apostles passed away, the clergy system was brought in. After that, only a few were able to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The saints opportunity to prophesy was replaced, and the one-man-speaking meeting came in to take its place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the same time, the clergy system produced the religious organization and destroyed the body nature of the church, killing the organic function of the Body, degrading it instead into an organization, and causing the church to deviate and to be distorted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason, we left Christianity and came into the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not want an organization; what we want is the organism.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not want to have one speaking and all listening.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather we want to have all speaking and all listening.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our emphasis is not the preaching but the prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord, which is to supply Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 14:1 says, Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is because prophesying is the highest spiritual gift.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This matter is not something that only a few can do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather all can do it one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 31 says, For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover prophesying builds up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verses 4 and 5 say, He who prophesies builds up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now I desire...rather that you may prophesy...that the church may receive building up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The conclusion from these few verses is that everyone who is saved is expected to desire after speaking for God that the church may be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 26 Paul continued by saying, Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let all things be done for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here it mentions mainly three things: psalms, teachings, and revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The psalms are for praising God, the teachings are for teaching men, and the revelations are for revealing and releasing the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All these are prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They should not be done by one man only.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the brothers and sisters should do this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason you need the exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since all of us love the Lord, love the church, and are willing to help others, we should first go to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, we should prophesy for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Prophesying must be based upon your own experience and your knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible is the expression for our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the daily life, you should grow in life and should labor in God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you go out to visit others, all this will become your capital with which to serve others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you go to the small group meeting or the district meeting on the Lord s Day, you will be able to practice prophesying for three to five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This requires that all of us be prepared for the prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You should have the few verses that you pray-read every day digested in you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The little you have every day will eventually become a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In a week you will have over ten verses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we all come together on the Lord s Day, we all pray-read these verses and share and prophesy according to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as we all labor to learn and to exercise, it will not be too difficult a thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Surely we will succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today in the Lord s recovery, we must make everyone seek after prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although this is not an easy thing to do, we will succeed if we have a heart for the Lord and if we desire to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I hope that we would take up these two burdens to visit others in our daily life and to prophesy in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Visitation will bring people to the meetings, and prophesying will keep people in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If all the visited ones prophesy in the meetings, the increase and spread of the church, the growth of the church, and the perfection of the saints will no longer be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why the new way is not a difficult way; it is just a laboring way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You must labor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You cannot be a pew member like those in the denominations, nor can you be in our former condition, participating only in miscellaneous affairs such as cleaning and ushering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the church was going to preach the gospel, you would only invite a few to come to listen to the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At that time, the brothers and sisters among us could still be somewhat relaxed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But today we cannot do that anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You must be revived every morning, and you must be overcoming every day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In addition, you have to learn the truth, experience life, pick up the burden, and pay the price to care for people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only then will the new way be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Forgive me for saying an honest word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All those who say that the new way is wrong are speaking nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only the lazy ones would say that the new way does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I hope that all those who have not seen the new way would not criticize or oppose.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Neither should those who have seen it condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whoever can practice it should just go ahead and practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whoever cannot practice it should just leave it alone.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But you have to see that this is an age of advance; everything is advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not be left behind any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We cannot change the truth, but we should always improve on the method.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>According to the truth in the Bible, this new way is the most scriptural way and the most effective way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I hope that we would all receive at least some amount of this word so that the Lord would have a way among us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on October 30, 1988.</S>
