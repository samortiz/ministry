   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR FINAL PRAYERS OF DAVID TO JEHOVAH Scripture Reading: Psa 140 145</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we begin to consider Psalms 140 through 145, I would like to say a word about hymn #960 in our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we sing this hymn, our heart is touched and we feel that the Lord is close to us and that we are close to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have the sense not mainly of the Lord's coming or of His being the King but of His nearness and dearness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We also have the feeling that the writer of this hymn was very intimate with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For instance, the third stanza says, "My heart is always with Himself,/My eyes are heavenward,/My lips would utter nothing else/Than meeting with my Lord./The coming of the Lord draws nigh,/His coming is for me;/His promise ever standeth firm/And soon fulfilled I'll see."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The writer addresses the Lord as "my King," an expression that indicates dearness and nearness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we sing or read this hymn, the greater is our sense of how dear and near the Lord is to us and we to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This word about Hymns, #960 may help us to appreciate Psalms 140 through 145.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These six psalms are not great or important, and they do not have any particular taste.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although these psalms are common, they nevertheless show us one striking thing that David, the writer, was very close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the sense of nearness to the Lord in these psalms is very similar to the sense in Hymns, #960.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning the arrangement of the one hundred fifty psalms, we have seen that Psalms 1 through 119 are on the law and that Psalms 120 through 134 are Songs of Ascents.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The last sixteen psalms, Psalms 135 through 150, are in three clusters: Psalms 135 through 139, Psalms 140 through 145, and Psalms 146 through 150.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Each of these sixteen psalms is plain, altogether lacking in a particular taste or flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have also seen that the Psalms are the expression of the complex sentiments of the psalmists.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the psalmists were close to the Lord, often while they were writing their sentiments, a revelation regarding Christ would break forth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We see such a revelation in Psalm 2:7: "You are My Son;/Today I have begotten You."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may compare the breaking forth of the revelations of Christ in the Psalms to Christ's sudden, unexpected transfiguration on the mountain Matt 17:1-2 and to His surprising ascension Acts 1:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although revelations concerning Christ burst out in many different psalms, no such bursting out takes place in the last sixteen psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Psalms 140 through 145, written by David, are all prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, I have entitled this message "Final Prayers of David to Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us now look into the content of these prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These psalms do not contain great or important things, but, as we will see, they are full of intimacy.</S>
