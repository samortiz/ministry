<div class='line'><b>1</b> Riches of Christ we should enjoy</div>
<div class='line'>And then His fulness we will be;</div>
<div class='line'>Partaking of His very self,</div>
<div class='line'>His testimony men will see.</div>

<div class='line'><b>2</b> Riches of Christ are what He is</div>
<div class='line'>To us who are His members true;</div>
<div class='line'>His fulness is what we become</div>

<div class='line'><b>3</b> Riches of Christ are typified</div>
<div class='line'>By Canaan's produce rich and sweet,</div>
<div class='line'>With which the temple great was built,</div>
<div class='line'>The Church's greatest type replete.</div>

<div class='line'><b>4</b> As Eve to Adam fulness was,</div>
<div class='line'>So is the Church to Christ her Head;</div>
<div class='line'>As Eve from Adam's being came,</div>
<div class='line'>The Church by Christ's own life is bred.</div>

<div class='line'><b>5</b> Christ's riches are Himself within,</div>
<div class='line'>His fulness is the Church without,</div>
<div class='line'>As His expression, full of Him;</div>
<div class='line'>The Church with Christ is built throughout.</div>
