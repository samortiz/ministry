<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE NEW MAN AND THE MAN-CHILD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rev. 2:7, 17, 26-27; 3:12, 20-22; 12:5; 17:3-5; 18:2a, 4; 19:7-9; 22:1-2a, 14, 17</h1><p>The burden of this chapter can be expressed by the following five phrases: 1) the eternal purpose of God; 2) Adam was the first man; 3) Christ is the second man; 4) the church is the new man; and 5) the overcomers are the man-child.<h2 class=head1>GOD’S ETERNAL PURPOSE WITH MAN</h2><h2 class=head2>The First Man</h2><p>As we saw in chapter one, the eternal purpose of God is to have a corporate man to express Him and represent Him. In order to express God, this man needs God’s image, and to represent God, he needs His authority. Genesis 1:26 clearly tells us that God created man in His own image, and He gave man the dominion, the authority, to rule over all things. In order for this man to fulfill God’s eternal purpose to express God with His image and to represent God with His authority, this man needs the life of God. Therefore, Genesis 2 presents the tree of life (v. 9).<p>The first two chapters of the Bible use three important words related to man: image, dominion, and life. Man was created in the image of God and was committed with God’s authority to have dominion over all created things, but he still needed the life of God. God’s intention, therefore, was that this corporate man would have His life to live by Him. However, man failed God. He did not take the tree of life but went to the wrong tree, the tree of knowledge. That is, man took knowledge and not God as his life.<p>In Genesis 2, the tree of life is nothing less than God Himself, and the tree of knowledge is nothing but Satan himself. To take life was to take God, but to take knowledge was to take Satan. The principle today is the same. If we take life, that means we are taking God, but if we take knowledge, we can be sure that we are taking Satan. God is the source of life, while Satan is the embodiment of death. If we take God, we have life. If we take Satan, that is, if we take knowledge, we have death. Knowledge brings death, and by taking knowledge, man failed.<h2 class=head2>The Second Man</h2><p>The first man was a failure, but Christ came as the second man. These two terms, the first man and the second man, are both mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:45 and 47. The first man failed, but the second man fully succeeded, because the second man, while He was on this earth, day by day and hour after hour constantly took the Father as His life. In John 6:57 Jesus said, “The living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father.” The Son, Jesus, came to live not by Himself but by the Father. He said, “I can do nothing from Myself” (5:30) and “The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works” (14:10). The second man lived by taking God the Father as His life. In this He was successful, but He was only one, an individual. He was the second man but still not the corporate man.<h2 class=head2>The New Man</h2><p>God needs a corporate man, a man composed of many men. An individual man alone is not adequate to fulfill God’s purpose. Therefore, this second man as a grain of wheat was multiplied. John 12:24 says, “Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.” How can a grain of wheat multiply? There is no other way but to fall into the ground and die. Following death, it grows, and by growing it multiplies. In this way one grain becomes many grains. We are the many grains. Now all the grains are being ground and blended into fine flour in order to make a loaf. First Corinthians 10:17 says, “Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body.”<p>This loaf is the new man. The second man has multiplied into the new man. In the Bible there is the first man, the second man, and the new man. The new man is first mentioned in Ephesians 2:15, which says, “Abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace.” Jesus Christ died on the cross to create a new man of two peoples, the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers. Ephesians 4:24 tells us to put on this new man. To put on the new man simply means that we all have to get into the church life. To put on the new man is to put on the church life. In the church life we are many persons, yet we all are one new man. Moreover, the one new man has one wonderful person, who is Jesus Christ. We are the new man, and He is the person of the new man.<p>We must never consider that the new man is individual. There is only one new man in the entire universe. No one is a complete new man; we all are simply members of this one new man. The one new man, who is the church, is corporately one.
