   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY OF COOPERATION IN ORDER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO DEVELOP WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has done everything on His part, so what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we forget what God has given us, this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Peter 1:5 says that along with what we have received of God, we have to add all diligence to do the developing work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has given us the seed, the soil, the land, the sunshine, the air, and the rain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything is here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible tells us that God has given us all things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we do not need to do a separate work by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We simply need to go along with what God has given, to develop what God has given.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do this by sowing the seed and watering it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then it will be developed step after step until we have a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the cooperation we need to render to God's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has done so much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now we need to cooperate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not just believe that since God has done everything, He will do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is wrong to think that everything must be done by God and that there is no need for us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But there is also another wrong extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the thought that we have to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The right way is that on the one hand, we realize that God has given everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the other hand, we realize that we need to cooperate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to develop what God has given.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have the seed, and now we need to sow it and water it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to render the proper cooperation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us apply this principle in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The hardest job in the whole world to the wives is for them to submit to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Surely the sisters cannot submit in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then what shall they do?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They may say, "I cannot have submission, but God can.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is the God of impossibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I cannot, but God can!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is good doctrine, but it does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God can be your submission, but He needs your cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The way of cooperation can be seen in Ephesians 5:18-22 and Colossians 3:16-18.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ephesians 5:22 says, "Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Colossians 3:18 says, "Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please notice that these verses end with the phrases as to the Lord and in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also have to read Ephesians 5:22 in the context of the previous verses.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They say that we need to be filled in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will be filled with God and filled with singing, praising, and thanking vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows that the submission comes out of the enjoyment of God, that is, out of the singing, praising, and thanking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some of the wives try to submit themselves to their husbands without singing, praising, and thanking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead they try by the "gnashing of teeth."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is no wonder that they cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are short of singing, praising, and thanking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If they would say, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hallelujah," and exercise their spirit to rejoice in the Lord, spontaneously they would submit themselves to their own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The real submission comes out of being filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God has given all things pertaining to life and godliness, and the submission of the wives is a small part of this godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Godliness is the expression of the life within, and this expression includes the submission of the wives.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we practice the right way to develop the seed within, this seed will grow into submission.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This submission will be sweet and spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is no need of self-effort by the gnashing of teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead, we need to be joyful in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then submission becomes an enjoyment, not a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It becomes our resting bed, not a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness, including submission.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now we need to cooperate with God to develop this seed by being filled.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Be filled in your spirit with the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Be filled with singing, with praising, and with thanking.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The issue of this will be godliness, including submission.</S>
