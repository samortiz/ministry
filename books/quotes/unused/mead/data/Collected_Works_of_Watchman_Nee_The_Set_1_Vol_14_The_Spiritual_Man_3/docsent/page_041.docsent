   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Holy Spirit Being the Master</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have said in another place that God disciplines our spirit through the Holy Spirit and that our spirit governs our body, our entire being, through our soul i.e., will .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A casual glance at this word does not seem to reveal anything of importance, yet the spiritual relationship it implies is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Holy Spirit only makes His will known to us by affecting our intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Holy Spirit fills, He fills only our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He does not directly govern our soul or our body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Neither does He directly fill our soul or our body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This point must be well noted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot expect the Holy Spirit to think through our mind, feel through our emotions, and propose through our will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, the Holy Spirit manifests His will in the intuition so that the believer himself thinks, feels, and proposes according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many believers assume that they have to offer their mind their head to the Holy Spirit and allow Him to think from within them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Little do they know that this is the biggest mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Holy Spirit never directly replaces man or uses man's mind in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Holy Spirit never requires man to consecrate passively.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He wants man to work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He will not work for man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The believer has the power to quench His move.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He does not force the believer to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Holy Spirit will not directly rule man's body either.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for a man to speak, he himself has to use his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order for a man to move, he himself has to lift his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order for a man to work, he himself has to use his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's Holy Spirit never infringes on man's freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Besides working in man's spirit, that is, in God's new creation, He will not move any part of man's body independent of man's own will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if man is willing, He will not substitute for man and move any part of his body because man has a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man must be the master of himself; he must use his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God Himself will not transgress His law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We often say that "the Holy Spirit controls man."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we mean that the Holy Spirit works within us, making us obey God, this expression is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we mean that the Holy Spirit directly controls our entire being, this is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Based on this we can distinguish between the work of evil spirits and the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit in order to show that we belong to God; evil spirits cleave to our bodies for the purpose of driving us like a machine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Holy Spirit asks for our cooperation, while evil spirits seek complete and direct control.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our union with God is in the spirit, not in the body or in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we mistakenly think that our mind, emotion, body, and will should all be directly "moved" by God, evil spirits will bring in their counterfeit work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is true that the believer should not act according to his own thoughts, emotions, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when he receives revelation in spirit, he should use his mind, emotion, and will to carry out the order of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Forsaking one's soul and body and expecting the Holy Spirit to directly use them is the initial step to demon-possession.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>SPIRITUAL LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Believers today have many misunderstandings with regard to spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can only briefly look at a few now:</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A. Conversation</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"For you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you" Matt 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A believer may think this means that God will speak on behalf of him, that he need not speak, and that God will speak words out from his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a believer "consecrates" his mouth to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He does not make any decision and expects to be God's "mouthpiece."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His lips and vocal cords fall into passivity, and he allows any outside supernatural force to use him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some who deliver messages for the Lord think that they do not need to use their mind and will during the meeting and that they simply need to offer their mouth passively to God and allow God to speak through their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The consequences of this action are: 1 the believer himself does not speak; 2 neither does God speak, because God does not regard man as a recorder; and 3 evil spirits utilize the believer's passivity to speak through his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This often causes the believer to experience a kind of power speaking through his mouth, enabling him to receive "messages from heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since what is spoken may be very good, the believer considers these words to be from God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The verse in Matthew simply refers to a situation in which one is persecuted and tried.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It does not say that the Holy Spirit will speak on behalf of the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The experience of the apostles Peter and John before the Sanhedrin later confirms this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Guidance</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"And your ears will hear a word behind you, saying,/This is the way, walk in it" Isa 30:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Believers do not realize that this verse specifically refers to the Israelites God's people in the flesh during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At that time, there will not be the counterfeit work of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Believers consider this kind of guidance by a supernatural voice to be the highest leading.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They think they are superior to others, having supernatural guidance all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They neither use their conscience nor their intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They just passively wait for a supernatural voice.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They assume that they do not need to think, consider, choose, or determine, but just "obey" passively.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They allow a voice to substitute for the function of their intuition and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As a result: 1 the believers do not use the conscience and intuition; 2 God will not command them to make them obey as a machine; and 3 evil spirits will use a supernatural voice to replace revelation in the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then evil spirits will attach themselves to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From that point on, believers no longer care for the prompting of their intuition, the voice of their conscience, what they understand and sense, or what others say.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They just stubbornly follow the supernatural voice without even considering it for a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Their moral standard gradually falls, and they are not even aware of it because they have allowed evil spirits to be a substitute for their conscience, and they can no longer discern good and evil.</S>
