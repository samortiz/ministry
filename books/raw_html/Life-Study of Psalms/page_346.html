<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. PRAISING JEHOVAH GOD</H2><P>Psalm 150 is a psalm on praising Jehovah God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In:</H2><P>Verse 1 is a charge to praise God in His sanctuary and in the firmament of His power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. For:</H2><P>Verse 2 speaks of praising God for His mighty acts and according to His vast greatness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. With:</H2><P>Verses 3 through 5 tell us to praise God with the blast of the trumpet, the harp and lyre, the tambourine and dancing, the stringed instrument and the pipe, the loud cymbals, and the loud clanging cymbals. Today our spirit is a much better "instrument" than any of the instruments mentioned in these verses. If we exercise our spirit, we will make good "music."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. By Everything That Has Breath</H2><P>Finally, verse 6 says that everything that has breath should praise Jehovah.</P>
