   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S ORGANIC SALVATION EQUALING REIGNING IN CHRIST S LIFE MESSAGE TWO GOD S ORGANIC SALVATION 2 SANCTIFICATION AND TRANSFORMATION OUTLINE God sanctifies us that we may have His holy nature the establishing of God s organic salvation Rom 6:19, 22; 15:16; 2 Pet 1:4: That we may be established in God s holy nature: We were created by God for Himself, but due to our fall and separation from God we were lost and became common in our position and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, in His complete salvation God sanctifies us in our position judicially and in our disposition organically: The judicial, positional sanctification is accomplished through the redeeming blood of Christ Heb 13:12; 10:29; 1 Cor 1:2; Rom 1:7; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matt 23:17.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The organic, dispositional sanctification is carried out by the Holy Spirit with the holy nature of God Rom 15:16; 6:19, 22; 2 Pet 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This causes us to be established in God s holy nature and thereby be made holy unto God Eph 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That we may be established in God s organic salvation: The sanctification in God s organic salvation is carried out by the Holy Spirit with the element of Christ s resurrection life to sanctify us in our disposition Rom 15:16 that our natural disposition, which is crooked, perverted, and full of peculiarities, may be sanctified by God s holy nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a dispositional sanctification is from our spirit, through our soul, and unto our body, so that our entire being can be wholly sanctified 1 Thes 5:23.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a sanctification causes us to be established in God s organic salvation so that we ultimately become as holy as the holy city, New Jerusalem Rev 21:2, 10; 22:19.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God transforms us that we may have His divine image the shaping of God s organic salvation Rom 12:2a; 2 Cor 3:18: That we may be shaped in the divine image: Transformation is not an outward correction or adjustment but the metabolic function of the life of God in us, by the addition of the element of the divine life of Christ into our entire being, that we may express the image of Christ outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God transforms us with the life element of the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man, who passed through death and entered into resurrection, until we are transformed metabolically into His image from one degree of glory to a higher degree of glory and are raptured and transfigured to enter into His glory 2 Cor 3:18; Phil 3:21.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is for the mass reproduction of the firstborn Son of God as the prototype of a God-man, that we may be shaped in the divine image to be just like the firstborn Son of God, Christ as the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That we may be shaped in God s organic salvation: The means of transformation in God s organic salvation: By the renewing of our mind Rom 12:2a.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By the Lord Spirit the pneumatic Christ in us, transforming us into the image of the glory of Christ 2 Cor 3:18b.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By our having an unveiled face, beholding and reflecting the Lord like a mirror to express Him 2 Cor 3:18a.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By our living and walking by the Spirit Gal 5:16, 25 and walking according to the mingled spirit Rom 8:4b that the divine life of Christ may have the way to regulate us and transform us into the image of the Lord in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a transformation causes us to be shaped in God s organic salvation and conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God, so that we manifest God in life, in nature, in inward thinking, and in outward expression; this will consummate in the New Jerusalem, in which, due to our transformation, we will be exactly the same as God, who sits on the throne in the divine glory in eternity both He and we will be like jasper Rev 4:3a; 21:11, 18a, 19b.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Prayer: O Lord, You have spoken and You will still speak until You fulfill Your eternal purpose, the manifestation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We continue to look to You that You will intensify Your work more than ever before.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Gain every one of the attendants here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this message, the second message on God s organic salvation, we would like to see the matters of sanctification and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first four points of God s organic salvation are regeneration, renewing, sanctification, and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regeneration is for us to have God s divine life; renewing is for us to become His divine, new creation; sanctification is for us to have His holy nature; and transformation is for us to have His divine image.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, first, we have His divine life; second, we become the divine, new creation; third, we have the holy nature; and fourth, we have the divine image.This is what God s organic salvation will accomplish in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God regenerates us that we may have His divine life; this is the base of God s organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God renews us that we may become His divine, new creation; this is the building up of God s organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God sanctifies us that we may have His holy nature; this is the establishing of God s organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God transforms us that we may have His divine image; this is the shaping of God s organic salvation.</S>
