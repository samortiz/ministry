   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Miriam and Aaron's Reviling of Moses</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Numbers 12 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They mixed up family affairs with the work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In God's calling Moses was singled out; Miriam and Aaron were only the helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was God's decision.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The disobedience of these two was also manifested in words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we know authority, many mouths will be shut and many problems will be prevented.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once we meet authority, many natural problems are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Miriam's words did not seem to be an overstepping.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She only said, "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Has he not spoken through us also?" v. 2 . But God understood that as reviling v. 8 . Perhaps there were many words which they had not spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps what was revealed was only the tip of the iceberg, a tenth of all that was there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps ninety percent was still hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as there is a spirit of rebellion in man, God will detect it no matter how many nice words he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rebellion is manifested in words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A rebellious word speaks of rebellion no matter whether it is strong or weak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Company of Korah Attacking Moses</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Numbers 16 when the company of Korah and the 250 leaders rebelled, the manifestation was all the more in words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever they had in their heart they spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They even broke out in open rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although Miriam reviled, she did so in a reserved way, and as such there was still the possibility of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the company of Korah had no restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything spilled over like a flood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even rebellion has degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some have more of a sense of shame, and they can be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But those who have shaken off all restraints, who are completely unchecked, open the gates of Hades for themselves, and Hades swallows them up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only did the company of Korah speak in an evil way; they attacked in an open way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was so serious that Moses had to fall on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How serious were such words: You take too much upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why are you lifting yourselves up above the congregation of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We only recognize Jehovah in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The whole congregation is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not recognize your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are taking too much upon yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here we see that whoever listens only to God's direct authority, but refuses His deputy authority, is in the principle of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a man submits to authority, surely he will restrict his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will not be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Acts 23 Paul was being tried.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As an apostle and prophet he spoke in the position of a prophet to Ananias the high priest: "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall" v. 3 . But at the same time Paul was a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When he heard that Ananias was the high priest, he immediately softened and said, " You shall not speak evilly of the ruler of your people'" v. 5 . How careful he was in his words, and how much he restricted his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rebellion Being Related to</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>the Walking after the Lust in the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man's rebellion is especially related to the indulgence of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 2 Peter 2:10 the flesh and the lust were first mentioned, then those who despise lordship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The expression of this despising of lordship is shown in reviling words, words of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Particular kinds of people live among those who are of their own kind; they have communication with their kind of people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rebellious ones always accompany those who walk after the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are also the ones who accompany those who indulge in the lust of uncleanness and who despise lordship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In God's eyes, walking after the flesh, indulging in lust, and despising lordship are all the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such ones are presumptuous, self-willed, and not afraid of speaking evil of dignities.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But those who know God are fearful on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The mouth has a lust, which is to speak evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we know God, we will be repentant and remorseful, because we will realize how much God hates this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The angels were under those with lordship at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For this reason, they dare not revile them with evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They dare not deal with a lawless spirit by lawless means.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, if we live before God, we cannot revile others with reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Please notice that it is possible to speak reviling words even in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>David could say that Saul was God's anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This proves that he was one who kept the proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The power of Satan is established upon lawlessness, while the angels are those that would not overstep their position.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Peter used this as an example to show us that since the angels in the heavens are like this, we should be like that even more v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There are only two things that cause a Christian to lose his power.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One is sin, and the other is speaking evil of those above him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more evil speaking, the more power is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If a man's lack of submission is in his heart only, without corresponding utterances from his mouth, his power will not be lost as fast.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The effect of speaking is much more serious than we can imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To God, man's thoughts and conduct are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As long as there is a thought, a sin is committed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, Matthew 12:34-37 also says that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the day of judgment, we will be judged righteous or sinful according to the words we have spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This shows us that there is a difference between words and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If there are no words, there is still the possibility of covering up.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But if the words come out, everything is thrown into the open.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For this reason, disobedience in heart is a little better than openly speaking with the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today Christians lose their power through their mouth in no less measure than they lose it through their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Actually, more is lost through the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All rebellious ones have trouble with their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, if a man cannot restrict himself in words, he cannot restrict himself in anything.</S>
