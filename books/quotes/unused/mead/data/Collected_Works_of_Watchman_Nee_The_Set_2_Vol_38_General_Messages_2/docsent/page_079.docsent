   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lacking in Root</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second reason that the word withers away is the lack of root.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What are roots?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The section of a tree that is above the ground is the trunk, and the section that is hidden under the ground is the root.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The visible life-section is the branches; the invisible life-section is the root.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the root represents the hidden life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who are rootless in the Lord live a dry life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who have no hidden spiritual life, except that which is manifest before men, have no root.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The root is the hidden, invisible part.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is exposed and visible is not the root.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brothers and sisters, we should ask ourselves: Besides the part of our life which is visible before men, how much hidden life do we have before the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If all that we have is that which is exposed, it is no wonder that we wither away as soon as the sun comes and scorches us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our spiritual life nothing sustains us like the hidden life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we see a brother or sister falling away, do not regard the fall as an accidental or sudden occurrence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, we should realize that there must be something wrong with his hidden life before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since he has no root, he falls when the sun rises to scorch him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Matthew 6:6 the Lord Jesus said, "But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To shut the door is to have a hidden life, and this is to have roots.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord spoke in a very peculiar way: The Father will see in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Oh, praying can be seen!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We think that praying is heard, but the Lord said that it is seen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes when we are before the Lord, we have no words; there is only an attitude this is precious also.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, what proportion of our life is seen by God in secret?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is all that we have apparent before men?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How much of our spiritual life before God has never been divulged?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How much experience do we have which is comparable to what Paul kept secret from other people for fourteen years 2 Cor 12:2 ?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we have none, it indicates that we have no root.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are persons without root, we will immediately fall away when the sun comes up to scorch us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brothers and sisters, only the part of us which can survive the test of trials is reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If our roots are not deep enough, we are bound to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Rocky Place</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The third reason that the word withers away is that there are rocks underneath the shallow earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A person with shallow earth may be willing to send his roots deep, but rocks may obstruct them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Outwardly, he is the same as other people, but within him there are hidden sins and a hardened self.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Bible the word rock has several meanings one relates to a stony heart Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>36:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we wish to send our spiritual roots deep, we should not harden our hearts Heb 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many Christians have never experienced the breaking of their concepts and have never been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They give many reasons to reject God's will and insist on their own views.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They always have opinions as to whether something should be done this way or that way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They have rocks within, and their hearts are very hard.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has to blast these inner rocks away before they can strike their roots.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is only one kind of people who can strike roots: those who tremble at the word of the Lord Isa 66:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, a heart that is not submissive to God is a stony heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should ask God to enlighten us and show us how big the rocks within us are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have rocks inside, we cannot strike roots, and when the sun comes up and scorches, how can we escape from withering away?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rocks not only stand for a hardened heart but also for hidden sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps there is a particular sin in your life which you have not given up because the price is too high, and you do not have the courage to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps God's demand is strong; consequently, you reason and argue with God because you cannot obey.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you allow your hidden sins to remain, you cannot strike roots.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the sun comes up and scorches, how can you escape from withering away?</S>
