   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE NINE THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 5 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 10, 6, 11, 13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message, I will review the major points of the previous messages on the experience and growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>LIFE BEING THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Life is God Himself, life is Christ, and life is the Spirit, but simply to say this is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Life is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The God who is life to us is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If God had never been processed in His Trinity, He would be life to Himself, but He could never be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for God to be life to us, He had to be triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the Triune God, He was processed through several steps: incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without each of these steps, the Triune God could not be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Incarnation is for the Father, with all His divine fullness, to be embodied in the Son Col 2:9 and through the Spirit Luke 1:35 that He might have humanity added to His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In incarnation the Son is the Father's embodiment, and the Spirit is the divine essence of the Son's incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Son is the embodiment of the Triune God with the Spirit as the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Son then went to the cross with the Father and through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His going to die on the cross was not the Father's crucifixion nor the Spirit's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was the Son's crucifixion, yet the Son was not alone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was crucified with the Father and through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the cross, Christ offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The process of crucifixion is of the Son with the Father through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Resurrection is the Son's resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In resurrection, the Son became the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Son, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Son who died through the cross resurrected in the Spirit and as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These are the processes the Triune God passed through in order to be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This life is the processed Triune God, the Son as the embodiment of the Father and the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a life is now embodied in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the word reaches us, it is spirit and life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have the Father, embodied in the Son, consummated as the Spirit, and embodied in the word, reaching us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE REVELATION OF LIFE IN ROMANS 8</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The five crucial verses concerning life in Romans 8, verses 2, 10, 6, 11, and 13, unveil to us five crucial points, in the order of their significance, as follows: The Law of the Spirit of Life</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 8:2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this verse the phrase "the law of the Spirit of life" is composed of three elements.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The order of these elements according to their significance is the Spirit, life, and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without the Spirit, you cannot have life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without life, the law is absent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The law comes out of life, and life is of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Romans 8 Paul did not say the Holy Spirit because "the Spirit" is understood to be the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit in the New Testament denotes not only the Spirit of God and the Holy Spirit but also the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word consummated implies a process.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before something is consummated or processed, it may be raw.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When food is uncooked, it remains raw, but once it is cooked, processed, or consummated, it is ready to be served at the dining table for people to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the same way, the Triune God has been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Spirit who is life to us is the consummated Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
