<h1 class="title">ALL HAVE SINNED</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 3:23</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The source of man&rsquo;s sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Sin came from Satan.</li>
	<li>Sin came into the world through Adam.</li>
	<li>Man is born in sin. Because man is the seed of Adam, man is sinful since his very birth.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s sinful life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man is born in sin, therefore man lives in sin.</li>
	<li>If man lives in sin, all his living is sinful, whether consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally.</li>
	<li>Give practical examples of how man commits sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man comes short of the glory of God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The glory of God is the standard of human morality. The glory of God is the manifestation of the character and the disposition of God. This glory should be the standard for man&rsquo;s living and man&rsquo;s morality. Whether a man is sinful or not should not be judged according to man&rsquo;s moral standards, but according to God&rsquo;s glory. Some deeds are not sinful according to human moral standards, but they are quite short according to God&rsquo;s glory. For example, God&rsquo;s divine disposition is manifested when He forgives man&rsquo;s sins. But man thinks to himself, &ldquo;As long as I do not offend others, it is not a sin for me not to forgive them when they offend me.&rdquo; How short is this lack of forgiveness when compared to the glory of God.</li>
	<li>According to this divine standard, we realize that there is no comparison between man&rsquo;s moral standard and God&rsquo;s divine disposition and character. Not only to hate people is sin, but also not to love people is sin.</li>
	<li>Man is made according to God&rsquo;s image. Man is the picture of God to express God. But now, because sin came in through Adam, man is full of sins and filthiness; so certainly man comes short of the glory of God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The way to salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are short of the glory of God.</li>
	<li>Christ is the effulgence of the glory of God. Receive Christ as your Savior, and He will enable you to live out the glory of God.</li>
	<li>Live in the presence of God by the life of Christ.</li>
	</ol></li>
