   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Adam</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Adam is a type of Christ Gen 2:7; 1 Cor 15:45, 47; Rom 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Romans 5:14 we are told that Adam was a type of the coming One, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Adam was the head of the old collective man mankind .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whatever he did and whatever happened to him is participated in by all mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this respect he is the type of Christ, who is the Head of the new corporate man the church, Eph 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whatever He did and whatever happened to Him is also participated in by all the members of His Body, the church Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Adam was the first man 1 Cor 15:47 and also the first Adam 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Adam was created by God and had nothing of the life and nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was merely God s creation, a work of His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the second Man and the last Adam 1 Cor 15:47, 45 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the last man, and after Him there is no third man, for the second Man is the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following Him there is not a third Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This second Man was not created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, He is a man mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is God incarnated to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first man had nothing of the nature and life of God, for He was merely God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The second Man is the mingling of God with His creature, full of the nature and life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is a man mingled with God, a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fullness of the Godhead is embodied in Him Col 2:9; John 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the last Adam Christ is the end of the old race, the end of mankind in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the second Man Christ is the beginning of another race, the start of a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no second Adam, only the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the sight of God there is one Adam beginning from Adam and ending with the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the first Adam is the beginning of mankind, and the last Adam is the ending of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The time from Christ s incarnation until His resurrection was a transitory period involving a transition from the old man or race to the new race.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The second Man was born through incarnation, but He was reborn through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In incarnation Christ was born to be the second Man and also took upon Himself the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then the old man was terminated at the cross, and the second Man was reborn in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is for this reason that we may speak of Christ first as being the last Adam and then as the second Man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Sacrifice Affording</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>the Coats of Skins for Adam and Eve</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament Christ is the sacrifice affording the coats of skins for Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them Gen 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this verse we see an anticipation of the redemption that was to be accomplished thousands of years later.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Adam and Eve were in a situation that needed redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Knowing that they were fallen and sinful, they tried to cover themselves with garments made of fig leaves Gen 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then God came in to deal with the situation, promising that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent v. 15 . Then God made coats of skins and clothed them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The expression coats of skins implies that some kind of sacrifice, probably a lamb, was slain for them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That sacrifice was a type of Christ as our righteousness 1 Cor 1:30 to cover us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For God to make coats of skins for Adam and Eve and clothe them means that He justified them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be justified means to be covered with the righteousness of God, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For Adam and Eve to be under the coats of skins signified that they were in Christ, for the coat is a clear type of Christ as God s righteousness Phil 3:9 to cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, figuratively speaking, Adam and Eve were in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The sacrifice that produced the coats of skins to Adam and Eve was slain as their substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The putting on of the coats of skins was based on the shedding of the blood of the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The sacrificial lamb was their substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then after God covered them with a coat of lamb s skins, they became one with the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As sinners they became one with the substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a matter of union, and union brings about the effectiveness of substitution, for without union substitution stands alone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Substitution does not have anything to do with us until we enter into a union with the substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once we participate in such a union, whatever the substitute has accomplished is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ has done everything for us on the cross, but without union all that He has accomplished is not related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But when we become one with Christ through believing in Him, whatever He accomplished on the cross becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, union brings in the effectiveness of substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Galatians 2:17 and 3:27 we have the fulfillment of the type in Genesis 3:21.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Galatians 2:17 speaks of seeking to be justified in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Galatians 3:27 says, As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To believe is to believe into Christ John 3:16 , and to be baptized is to be baptized also into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By both faith and baptism we have been immersed into Christ, having thus put on Christ and become identified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To put on Christ by being baptized into Christ is to clothe ourselves with Christ, to put on Christ as a garment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the one hand, in baptism we are immersed into Christ; on the other hand, in baptism we put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When a person is immersed into Christ, he automatically puts on Christ as his clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that the baptized one has become one with Christ, having been immersed into Him and having become clothed with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be baptized into Christ is to enter into an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In order to experience this organic union, we need to believe into Christ and to be baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Believing and being baptized are two parts of one step.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First we believe into Christ, then we are baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>By believing in Christ we enter into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We believe ourselves into Him and thereby experience an organic union with Him, becoming one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In addition to believing into Christ, which is inward and subjective, we also need to be baptized into Him, an act which is outward and objective.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Through the inward action of believing and the outward action of being baptized we make one complete step to enter into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The step which begins with believing into Christ is completed by being baptized into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In this way there takes place in full an organic union between the believers and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this union we are truly clothed with Christ.</S>
