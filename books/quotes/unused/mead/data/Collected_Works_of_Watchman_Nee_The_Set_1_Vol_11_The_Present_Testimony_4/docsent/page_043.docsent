   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>No doubt, such a thing may be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But have we stood before the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to stand before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Standing means to not walk or move; it means to remain in a place, to stand still and wait for the Lord's order.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brothers, this is the ministry to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The killing of cattle and sheep in the outer court is done whenever someone comes to offer a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in the Holy of Holies, there is utter solitude and no man in sight.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Holy of Holies, no brother or sister has any authority over us, neither will a conference make decisions for us, nor does a committee have the authority to commission us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Holy of Holies, there is only one authority that will govern us, and that is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We will only do what the Lord directs us to do; otherwise, we will not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brothers, can we really stand before Him?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we want to minister to the Lord in the Holy of Holies, we must spend time before the Lord and pray more.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Otherwise, we will be inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to pray to be ushered into God's presence and to draw near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, to pray is to stand before God; it is to seek His will before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thank the Lord that although every believer does not do this, some are standing before the Lord and following Him in the journey ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to stand before the Lord, it is necessary "to offer unto me the fat and the blood" Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>44:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We know that God is holy and righteous in the Holy Place and that God is glorious in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's glory fills the Holy of Holies; God's holiness and righteousness fill the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The blood is for God's holiness and righteousness, while the fat is for His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fat is for God to gain something, while the blood deals with God's holiness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all know that God is holy and righteous and that He absolutely cannot accept anyone sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the shedding of blood or the remission of sin, without man paying a price for his sin, God will never be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, there is the need for the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no way to approach God without it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Old Testament time, man was put aside and could not come forward to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we can come before God because we have the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only so, but we also have to offer the fat, which means to offer the richest and best.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We know that the blood deals with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the fat is for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fat is the richest and best part, and it satisfies God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, it is for God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All those who would come before God to minister to Him must answer to God's holiness, righteousness, and even His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The entire Bible, both the Old Testament and the New Testament, focuses on these three things: God's holiness, God's righteousness, and God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's glory refers to God Himself; God's holiness refers to His nature; and God's righteousness refers to His way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, God's way is righteous, God's nature is holy, and God Himself is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every time we come before God, we must first realize how we are able to stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is holy and righteous!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How can sinners like us meet Him?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can meet Him because the blood is here, remitting and cleansing us from our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, we can approach God without any conflict because His blood has cleansed us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, He is not only holy and righteous; He is also glorious in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, there is a need to offer the fat, which is to offer up our very best to God for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, the blood deals with everything in the old creation, and the fat speaks of everything in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The blood dispels everything of the old creation, so that we no longer have a problem concerning holiness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The fat is of the new creation, which signifies the offering of ourselves to God, so that we no longer have a problem with God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot minister to God if we do not know death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Death is not a doctrine or a theory from the Bible; it is poured out through a genuine trust in Him and in the pouring out of His incorruptible blood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When His incorruptible blood was poured out, we too were poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now our Lord has no blood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He only has a body with bones and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything of the natural life was poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the Lord's blood was poured out, everything of the soul-life was poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He indeed poured out His soul unto death Isa 53:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the significance of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The pouring out of the blood is the removal of everything natural.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We will speak more concerning this matter later.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we want to minister before God, we need to draw near to Him, stand before Him, and wait for His will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Please remember these two indispensable matters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the one hand, we must continually pour out "our blood" we must continually acknowledge that everything we have by birth and lose by death has been poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many frequently ask me what the natural life really is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I often answer them by saying that everything that comes with birth and goes with death is of the natural life; everything that exists between birth and death is the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He has already poured out everything of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In other words, He has poured out everything that we obtained and everything that came by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the Lord poured out His blood, He did not only pour out His own life, but ours as well.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, we have to continually stand on this fact and deny our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brothers and sisters, this is altogether not a doctrine but a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everything of the natural life is thus dropped before God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brothers and sisters, this is a goal that we can attain to because, in Christ, everything of the soul has been poured out so that it is now possible for us to be selfless.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thank the Lord, we can be selfless because Christ poured out our self when He poured out His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>By ourselves, this is impossible; we cannot crucify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Thank the Lord that the Son of God has accomplished this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>By Him we can die, and by Him we can give up our self.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But it is not sufficient just to die, because death is only the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our focus before God is not only on death but also on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When He arose, we were in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In Him, we became a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He not only died but also rose from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He lives unto God; therefore, all that He is, is for God's satisfaction and not for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Brothers and sisters, this is what God wants to show us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is what it is to minister to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must offer Him the fat and the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Verse 16 says, "They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This verse tells us that there is a place to minister to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The ministry to the Lord is in the sanctuary a hidden, quiet place not public like the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Brothers and sisters, may He grace us so that we would not consider it a suffering to be in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Actually, a day there is better than a thousand days in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Yet we are always afraid of the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>How good it is to be in the outer court!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Everyone can see us there.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>How good it is to be in the outer court!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They all know us there.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>How good it is to be in the outer court!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Our names are well known, and there is no attack or slander there, only a welcome and praises.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But God wants us to be in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When we are in that place, others may say that we are lazy and not doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In reality, what is done there is far superior to the work of ministering to the people in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Have you heard others criticizing you for being small and narrow?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Have you heard others say that you will not do this or that?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Others may say that you are too lazy to work and that you have left many things undone.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But brothers and sisters, our hearts are not narrow at all.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We are not asking anything of men, and we do not want to stand at the gate for many to see.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We have only one goal, which is to minister to the Lord in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Brothers and sisters, we are not willing to minister in the house because our hope and our task are greater than this.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>No one here is as ambitious as Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He had one ambition, which was to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The things we are seeking here are greater than many other things, and our labor here is greater than that of many who do great works.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The fact is that our heart is broader than anyone else's. Brothers, do not think that we are too small and narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We are very broad, for we are not only ministering to the house but to the Lord as well.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Of course this is not that great in the sight of man.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Brothers and sisters, we would rather let others criticize us than to move without God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We have only two positions here: one is that we are dead and have dropped everything of the old creation; the other is that we are resurrected and are serving God, learning to stand before Him, listening to His order, and waiting in His presence to minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We do not care for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>O brothers and sisters, is God's will enough to satisfy you?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Is it enough to do His will?</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Is His will good enough?</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Or are you still pursuing other things?</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Are all of God's plans for you good enough?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Oh, you must learn to minister to God in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Since time is so short and we also have to cover Luke 17, I cannot share in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>I have said earlier that I wanted to mention three things.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>One is the difference between ministering to the house and ministering to the Lord; another is the way to minister to the house and the way to minister to the Lord; and the third is the requirements and condition of one who ministers to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Now let us consider the requirements of one who ministers to the Lord.</S>
