When we come before God, some people may come with a depressed feeling. Some may feel that they have not done well during the previous week, that they have disobeyed God's word, or that they have backslidden. As a result of these feelings, a person can be frustrated from worshipping God and drawing near to Him in a spontaneous and sweet way.</P><P>Today we will consider one matter. This matter is true not only in the Old Testament but in the New Testament as well. How can man come to God? Many people think that they can worship God when they have some merit, when they have performed good works, or when they deserve God's praise. Others think that because they have not performed well and have done many things that displease God, they cannot come to God to worship Him.</P><P>But whether or not our works are good has nothing to do with our coming to God. Please read verse 19, "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus." This verse tells us that our coming to God is in nothing else other than the blood of the Lord Jesus. Good works, zeal, or spiritual experiences cannot qualify us to come before God or make us more worthy to draw near to Him. Only the blood of the Lord Jesus enables us to draw near to God. If you think that the blood of the Lord Jesus is not enough for you to draw near to Him, I will tell you honestly that you will never be able to come to Him or worship Him.</P><P>Different persons have different conditions and situations. Some may have some shortcomings; others may have some sins. Some may have fallen seriously; others may be better. If coming to God is based on a person's spiritual condition, how can we worship God together in oneness? None of our hands are clean; they are all mud-stained and defiled. But by the blood, we can come boldly to God to worship Him. Without the blood, no one can worship, and there is no worship. The Lord's blood is effective not only on earth but in heaven as well. Not only was it effective on the cross, but it is effective on the throne as well, so that we can now come to the Holy of Holies to worship God.</P><P>Some may say that God is too gracious in this way, but we must realize that it is through the blood that we are qualified to worship. It is true that God is full of grace, but it is not all grace. If God were to forgive our sins carelessly and allow us to come before Him to worship Him carelessly, that would indeed be great grace. But those who have considerable Bible knowledge and deep spiritual experience, and who are excellent in life and conduct, are no more qualified than we are in coming to worship God. Everyone who comes before God must have the blood; everyone needs the cleansing of the blood before he can come before God. We are the same as everyone else, and we must come to God by the blood. If there is a meeting where the blood is replaced with good works or spiritual experience and where there is trust in these things to come to God, this worship is not acceptable to God. If anyone bases their worship on the works they have performed during the previous week, they do not know what worship means. Let us learn to worship by the blood and come to God through the blood.</P><P>Many people say that there are many similarities between Christians and Israelites. They say that with the Israelites, there were three kinds of worshippers: those who offered the sacrifices outside the tabernacle, those who served in the Holy Place, and those who served the Lord in the Holy of Holies. They say that, in a similar way, there are three kinds of Christian worshippers. Those who say this do not know what worship is. We have to know that the Israelites are different from us. Every one of us can come to the Holy of Holies to worship, while the Israelites could not. The picture in the Old Testament is a picture of estrangement. The congregation could not do anything. They could not worship directly or even slaughter the goats and bulls themselves; they had to depend on the priests to do this for them. They were estranged from God and could not worship Him directly. The New Testament is different. Every believer can worship within the Holy of Holies, and no one can worship in place of another. Strictly speaking, even the Lord Jesus cannot replace us in our worshipping. It is true that the Old Testament divides the worshippers into the congregation, the priests, and the high priest. Only the high priest could go into the Holy of Holies once a year with the blood. No other person could enter into it. But every one of us is like the high priest; we can all enter into the Holy of Holies. We say that the Lord Jesus is the High Priest; it is true that He is our High Priest before God in heaven and that we are all individual priests. But at the time of worship, it is a different story.</P><P>Some say that we need the Lord Jesus to do everything for us and that He is our Mediator and go-between. But there is no such thing. Verses 19 and 20 tell us that the Lord died for us in order that we could come directly to God. Both in the Old Testament and New Testament, the blood on the altar is for the remission of sins. But at the same time, the blood shed on the cross is also for us to draw near to God. Some have thought that a person receives forgiveness through the blood but that he worships and draws near to God through his works. This is why some think that when they do well that week, read the Bible, and pray all the time, they can come boldly to worship God, sing, and pray. Others think that they have not done well and therefore are not worthy to worship; they cannot sing and have no faith to pray. By doing this, they have made the blood worthless. We worship God through the blood, just as we are forgiven through the blood.</P><P>The book of Romans mentions the blood and the book of Hebrews also mentions the blood. But these two references are different. Romans speaks of the blood on the propitiation cover that is for redemption, whereas Hebrews speaks of the blood before the veil that is for drawing near to God and worshipping Him. The blood not only forgives and cleanses us from our sins but brings us near to God and leads us to worship. You may argue, in spite of this, that you have not done well this week and cannot come boldly to God. What should you do? Let me ask you, when will you ever do well? When will you ever be able to think that you are good and can worship Him with all boldness? When will you ever be able to cry out "Hallelujah"? If you have to wait until you are able to do these things, you will wait until you are raptured before you can worship Him. You cannot determine your eligibility for worshipping based on your good or bad conduct. Instead, your worship should be based on the blood.</P><P>Suppose the Lord's beloved disciples, Peter, John, or Paul, could meet with us today. The way they would come and worship before God is the same way we come and worship before God. They have to trust in the blood. Do not think that they are nearer to God, more acceptable to Him, and more capable of worshipping. There is no such thing. If anyone says this, I will be the first one to stand up to refute it. Peter, John, and Paul are the same as we are; everyone has to draw near to God through the blood alone.</P><P>I heard that someone said that as long as he can crawl into heaven and stand inside the gate, he will be satisfied. But no, we do not crawl before the Lord and worship Him in such a fearful way. We come to God in boldness and without fear. We have the right to be God's children; this is God's promise to us. When I was young, whenever I went to visit someone, my heart would pound wildly. I was afraid that others would not be happy to see me. When I knocked at someone's door, I dared not knock twice out of fear that I would make others unhappy, or that the person inside would open the door to rebuke me and immediately shut the door. I did not have the boldness to meet people. But this is not the way we come to God. We come with authority and a commission. We come to Him as if coming to our own house; we knock at the door boldly and enter naturally. We should all come to the Holy of Holies and meet God with such an attitude. If we know the worth of the blood, we will surely have boldness. The knowledge of the blood's worth is the condition for worship. If we want to have power in our worship, we have to abide under the blood. Even the weakest and poorest believer has the same authority as the apostles did to worship God. His weakness can never lower the value and effectiveness of the blood. Every time we worship, we do so according to the blood. Our good works cannot add anything to the worth of the blood.</P><P>Our breaking of the bread (the Body) is a sign that the veil (the Lord's body) has been broken. The barrier has been removed, and we can now enter the Holy of Holies. The cup is a symbol that the Lord has died for us and that His blood has led us to come near to God. I have to emphasize again that our qualification for coming to God has nothing to do with our weakness; we come because of the blood. If we look up to the blood, we can come before God every day, and we will not lose our boldness. Consider how you came to God the first time with your burden of sin, drew near to Him, and called on Him. Similarly, when we come to Him to worship Him, we can come boldly without being hindered by our own work or feeling but with a single heart that looks up to the blood. May we realize this more and more. In this way, we will be able to worship and praise God in oneness and harmony. By the Lord's blood, we can serve and worship our God boldly and with authority.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE CORPORATE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 45</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:13; Rom. 9:3; 1 John 4:7; James 4:7; Eph. 5:22-24; 1 Cor. 12:25; Eph. 5:21; Hosea 7:8</H1><P>During the past few days I have been paying attention to one thing, which is what a Christian has to be in order to be a cake that is turned. What is a cake that is not turned? It is one that has heat on one side and no heat on the other side. To be a turned cake is to be cooked on both sides. This is a great principle in the Bible. In many matters a Christian has to pay attention to both sides. If he pays attention to only one side, he will be like a cake not turned. One side will be either burned and overcooked, and the other side will still be watery and uncooked. If the sisters have vegetables or meat that are burned on one side and raw on the other side, it means that the food has not been turned. Please remember that it is most important to be turned. Anything that is not turned is burned on one side and raw on the other. The meaning of being turned is to pay attention to both sides. A person should pay attention to one side as well as to the other. He should learn from one side as well as from the other.</P><P>The message this afternoon may not be a principle of spiritual life, but it is a principle of a believers' daily living. This principle is the balance between the corporate life and the individual life. On one hand, we have to pay attention to the corporate life. On the other hand, we have to pay attention to the individual life. On one hand, we are members. But on the other hand, we are also the Body. This is why we have to pay attention to our life as members and to our life in the Body. We are not alone but with all the ones who constitute the Body.</P><P>In the Catholic Church today, all the authority rests in the hands of the pope; all Catholics listen to the pope. There is no such thing as sects with them. But Protestantism with five hundred or more years of history had, by a few decades ago, over fifteen hundred sects. Since then, there may be even more. The Catholic Church is unified, and from the first day until now, everyone has been following the orders of the pope. Catholics are very obedient to the pope. But with Protestants, there are many sects, each with its own beliefs and ideas. Catholics have gone to one extreme; the conscience of the individual is not important and everyone simply follows the pope. Protestants, on the other hand, only care for their own conscience and ignore the views of others. Once a few people develop a different view, they put up a sign and start another group. The result is many denominations. Catholicism is an unturned cake, and Protestantism is also an unturned cake.</P><P>The Bible is in between these two extremes. It speaks of personal liberty, the voice of the conscience, and it also speaks of listening to others and submitting one to another. We are the Body; yet at the same time, we are the members. Every one of us should be an independent individual in this world. At the same time, every one of us should submit to other brothers and sisters. We have to maintain our life as members and also maintain the Body life. We have to pay attention to the corporate life and also pay attention to the individual life. If we pay attention to one aspect only, we will become an unturned cake. If we only pay attention to others and do not have any ideas of our own, we will become an unturned cake. Before God, we have to pay attention to the individual as well as to the Body. Today we will mention some differences between the individual life and the corporate life, but you have to excuse me for not being able to go into detail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. "WHETHER WE WERE BESIDE OURSELVES,<br>IT WAS TO GOD;<br>OR WHETHER WE ARE SOBER-MINDED,<br>IT IS FOR YOU"<br>(2 CORINTHIANS 5:13)</H2><P>Being beside ourselves is being crazy; we do this to God. But we are sober-minded for others. On one hand, this is very personal; on the other hand, this is very corporate. Being beside ourselves is a personal matter. Being sober-minded is a corporate matter. For example, a person may study the Bible by himself in the morning. He may receive some light from the Lord and unconsciously hit the table a few times. There is nothing wrong with this. While I am standing here today, if I hit the table when I think of a verse, would you not say that I am unsound? Paul was beside himself before God but sober-minded before men. If you are alone by yourself, you can hit the table or chair and be beside yourself with joy before God. But if you are before men, you have to be sober-minded. Many people are bound before God; it seems that they do not know how to pray. Actually, a person's heart should be as hot as possible before God. When we are before God by ourselves, we can be very free and jump up and down in an ecstatic way or shout "hallelujah" all the time. But if you are in a meeting and others are with you, or someone can hear you in the next room, you cannot shout and cry as you wish. You have to be sober-minded before men. I may be speaking too frankly, but this is the teaching of the Bible. Paul said that we can be beside ourselves only before God, while before men we have to be sober-minded.</P><P>An unseemly thing today is that men display the ecstasy that they should have before God to others. The Bible never permits this. Can you pray when you are in your room with only your underwear and no socks? We all can do this. But if you are in a meeting, you surely cannot pray this way. What you can do before God may not necessarily be permissible before men. We still have to be sober-minded before men for their sake.</P><P>What is the meaning of being sober-minded? Being sober- minded is being careful and having self-restraint. Being sober-minded is being polite; it is not being crazy, but proper. If you never pray by yourself and only pray in front of men, and if you never read the Bible in your own room and only read in front of people, you are like a shop that exhibits every item of its merchandise and has nothing left in the warehouse. This is not being beside yourself before God; it is living a fallen life, one that God will never bless. There is the need for soberness before men. There is also the need for being beside ourselves before God. If we do both, we are a turned cake.</P><P>If I lived in a rural place with no one around me, not even shepherds or ranchers, I could shout and pray as loud as I wanted. If I did this, no one would touch me. But I live in Wen-teh Lane. Even though I live in a room by myself, my neighbors would think that I am sick or that someone had died in my room if I suddenly shouted in the middle of the night. Please remember that a person can only be beside himself before God; he must take care of soberness before men. You have to learn to be sober before men and beside yourself before God. Many people are sober before God and men. They are lifeless before men and God. Paul was beside himself before God, but he was very unassuming before men. The letters he wrote were serious in their tone, yet when he met men face to face, he was very unassuming. He was very normal. We should learn to be beside ourselves before God and sober before men.</P><P>A few years ago when I was sick, I went for some rest to the place of a brother, who was very good in prayer. His room was next to my room but I often could not sleep at night because of my fever and bodily weakness. I noticed once that a light was on in his room. When I knocked at his door and asked why he was not in bed, he told me that he was about to go to bed. After a while I went over to see him again, and he was still not in bed. He finally went to sleep about two o'clock in the morning. I am not against praying the whole night, but you should remember that you can only be beside yourself before God. If you are beside yourself before men, others will not be able to stand you. You may not need to sleep, but others do. You may want to stay up late, but others do not. When I saw him the next day, I said, "Brother, I am not saying this because I did not sleep well last night. But if you continue to do what you are doing, it will not be good for you and for others." He did not believe my words. Later, he began to vomit blood. Before God, we can be beside ourselves. But if we are beside ourselves before men, we are an unturned cake.</P><P>Brothers, please do not be offended by my frank words. I hope that you will take care of both sides. On one hand, we should be lively before God. On the other hand, we should be very normal before men. If you want to be a special Christian, only be one before God. Do not exhibit all your treasures before men. Do not speak with a special tone of voice or walk in a special kind of way. We should act very normal before men. We should wear what others wear and eat what others eat. We have to be a turned cake. If we are beside ourselves before God and men, we are an unturned cake. We have to realize that both aspects are precious. God is pleased with both. We have to be zealous before God and normal before men.</P><P>The brother that I spoke of earlier was married. I have asked others about this brother. I have been told that his wife will fix a meal and he will not come to the table. He will not eat his lunch at noon and sometimes does not even come by two o'clock. At five or six o'clock in the afternoon, someone still has to remind him to take his lunch. He is beside himself before God, but he is not very sober before men. This is not the right attitude for a Christian. Do not think that just because you are zealous, you can eat lunch at six o'clock in the afternoon. If you are all alone, you can have lunch at midnight, but if your wife and others are waiting, you should keep the time. You cannot discard manners before men. On one hand, we should be as zealous as possible before God, but on the other hand, we should do our best to take care of the brothers and sisters when we are among men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BEING SUBJECT TO GOD<br>AND SUBJECT TO ONE ANOTHER<br>(JAMES 4:7 AND EPHESIANS 5:21)</H2><P>James 4:7 tells us to be subject to God, and Ephesians 5:21 tells us to be subject one to another. Brothers, do you see this? Here are two sides once again. On one hand, we have to be subject to God, and on the other hand, we have to be subject to one another. Being subject to God is a personal matter, but being subject to one another is something that we should practice among the brothers. In the church today, some people are unturned cakes. As long as the brothers and sisters agree on something, they follow even if it is a sectarian teaching or heretical doctrine. As long as the majority of the people agree, they follow. As a result, even God's commands and biblical teachings are set aside. This also is an unturned cake. They have taken care of man's side but ignored God's side; consequently, they have become unturned cakes. But there is another group of people who would not care for what other brothers and sisters feel or think. They only do what God says. They are like the brother I have mentioned, who thinks that all that a person needs is zeal and who does not care for his wife at all. This is also an unturned cake.</P><P>There are many things that are God's will, but often they are limited by man's hand; consequently, there is the need for patience and waiting. It is true that knowing God's will is enough, but it is also good to have the testimony of two or three brothers. If a finger moves, does only one finger move and the whole body not move? Is it not true that when a member moves, all the other members move as well? A member cannot move by itself because, even though there are many members, the Body is one.</P><P>I will say a few words especially to the co-workers. In China we are making a start in many areas. Obviously, there are many dangers that we have to avoid. Not only do we have to learn obedience in our conduct, but we must learn obedience even in the matter of doctrine. Otherwise, division and sectarianism will arise among us. Suppose you receive some light. Since it is from God, you may ignore everything else and start preaching about the light. But the brothers who are with you may not see as clearly as you. In such a case, you should wait for their consent before you preach. If you do not do this, division will occur. You may say that God has revealed this to you, but a brother may say that he has not seen it clearly enough and fears that it may be a heresy. In this instance, you should wait. The Bible says that we should be subject to God, but the Bible also says that we should be subject to one another. When the brothers have different views, they should not argue or be divided. They can wait and pray, and they can gradually learn and watch. Let me say an honest word: nothing helps a person's spiritual progress more than waiting. If something is genuine, it will still be genuine after a person waits for a while. If something is wrong, there is even more of a reason for waiting. It is fortunate when a person waits; when he waits, mistakes are avoided. However, unless we truly deny ourselves and bear the cross, we cannot wait. To wait humbly requires God's grace. We should learn this lesson.</P><P>We should obey God's word, will, and command at all cost. Among the brothers and sisters, any problem that can wait for a solution should wait for a solution. Of course, if we care only for waiting and ignore obedience to God, we also become an unturned cake. Many people do not obey just because others object. This is to be an unturned cake. If a matter is doctrinally clear and according to the teaching of the Bible, even if there is the frustration from the flesh, we should not wait for the consent of others before we obey. There is a limit to our being subject to one another. When you intend to be subject to God and I intend to be subject to God, there is the need for us to wait for each other. If a brother is not clear about a certain question, and he asks me to wait a while, I should be willing. I should be willing because I know that this brother is one who is subject to God and seeks to please God. Being subject to one another is only necessary among those who are willing to obey. If a man has never obeyed God, you will not receive his consent even if you waited for a lifetime. In this instance, you cannot wait for him. Otherwise, you will become an unturned cake and be dragged down by him.</P><P>Brothers, before the Lord, we have to do our best to pay the price to obey Him. Toward the brothers and sisters, however, we should wait when there is a need for waiting. Individual accomplishments and lonely endeavors are never according to God's attitude in the church. Acts 13:1-3 says, "Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers...And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away." The denominations call this the ordination and establishment of the clergy. But can teachers ordain apostles? There cannot be such a thing. The laying on of hands here means that one has a share in the affairs of the other. In the Old Testament, when a man put his hand on the head of a sacrifice, it meant that the going away of the sacrifice was his going away, and the death of the sacrifice was his death. The laying on of hands here means that these ones expressed their participation with Barnabas and Paul. Paul and the others went in the condition of one accord among the prophets and teachers in Antioch. This is why they could return to Antioch later and could relate to the others the grace that God had entrusted to them and the works that they had done. This is an important principle. A person has to be subject to God, and he also has to be subject to the brothers. He should consider not only what God has to say, but also what the brothers have to say. This is true not only in the work but also in the meetings. The principle of being subject one to another can take us a long way. We have to be subject to God, and we also have to receive the consent of the brothers and sisters.</P><P>Once I wanted to go to the country to preach the gospel. The particular village I wanted to go to had some cases of robbery and murder. Before I left, two elderly sisters advised me not to go. So I canceled my boat ticket and the house I had rented there. Personally, I knew God wanted me to go, but I also knew that God wanted me to be subject to them. The flesh is always in a hurry. However, I was also aware that I should obey the Lord. Later, some other brothers went and many people were saved. Although I had no part in it, I was satisfied. We should obey the Lord. But if we are not subject to the brothers, we will become an unturned cake. We have to be turned this way and that way. If we are not, then we will become an unturned cake.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. "THAT THERE WOULD BE NO DIVISION<br>IN THE BODY"<br>(1 CORINTHIANS 12:25)</H2><P>In studying the book of 1 Corinthians in the past, we have seen the Body of Christ. We can advance individually, but no growth is independent of the Body. For example, my mouth eats, but my whole being is also eating. Can I say that my mouth eats but that my whole being does not eat? When my hand works, my whole being works. When my feet walk, my whole being walks. The move of one member is the move of the whole body. I have used this example before: when I take a check to the bank to cash, the cashier gives me the money. Do just my hands receive the money? Will the cashier say, "I am giving your hands the money; I am not giving it to you"? Are there any cashiers who would say this? Everyone would acknowledge that when my hands receive the money, I receive the money.</P><P>There is an important truth in the Bible: the growth of one member is the growth of the whole Body. When two eyes see, the whole body sees. When two ears hear, the whole body hears. When the mouth speaks, the whole body is speaking. When the hands work, the whole body works. When one member moves, the whole body receives the benefit. Therefore, a person cannot live an individual life. All the work and conduct of a member is related to the whole Body. This is why there is a need for the same care for each other. You cannot be independent and presume that you have nothing to do with the other members. You should not cause the whole Body to fail by your own failures. When the eyes are blind, the whole body is blind. The Lord says that you should testify. Yet you do not open your mouth. When you turn back, the whole Body turns back. The mouth eats, but the whole body receives the nourishment. The nose smells, but the whole body senses the aroma. The ears hear music, but the whole person enjoys the music. The Body (that is, the Body of Christ) has a universal aspect and a local aspect. When one meeting suffers, the church suffers as a whole. Whatever a person eats, smells, and hears affects his whole body; similarly, the goodness, evil, progress, and fall of an individual Christian affect the whole church.</P><P>We should be willing to follow the Lord alone. But we should take care of the pace of the brothers and sisters. Some are too individualistic. They are accustomed to fighting and doing things by themselves. They do not care for the other brothers and sisters. They have forgotten that they are just members. Let me say an honest word: we should soar like an eagle in the sky, advance spiritually, and obey God individually. But we should also humbly wait for the other brothers and sisters and go on and obey God corporately.</P><P>Brothers, have you seen the relationship between a member and the Body? I have mentioned these three points to show us the corporate and individual life. We should maintain the individual part of our life. At the same time, we should pay attention to the corporate part of our life. On one hand, we should pay any price to allow God to gain something. But on the other hand, we should also pay any price to gain the oneness of the brothers and sisters. Do not think that you can monopolize everything. The whole body is not the eyes, and the whole body is not the ears. We should not neglect God's side, and we should not neglect man's side. May God bless us so that we know the preciousness of the individual life as well as of the corporate life. May we not annul the corporate life by our individual life, and may we not annul the individual life by our corporate life. Let us be a turned cake. If we are only cooked on one side and are not turned, God will not be pleased with us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FOUR MINISTERS<br>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 46</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 9:20-28; Matt. 4:18-22; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:22; 1 Pet. 2:3-5; 1 John 2:12-13; John 21:18, 21; Acts 28:23; 2 Tim. 1:15; 2 Pet. 2:1; 1 John 4:1; 2 John 7</H1><P>This morning I want to talk about four different ministers in the New Testament. The word minister, according to the Greek, refers not only to the deacons but also to the serving ones. All who work for God and the gospel are ministers. So when we say four ministers, we mean four different workers. In the passages that we have just read, there are four different subjects, which are the four main subjects of the New Testament. The ones who preached these four subjects are the four ministers.</P><P>There is a special thing in the New Testament: there were three disciples from among the twelve, who were with the Lord all the time. What are the names of these three disciples? I think all of you know their names; they are James, Peter, and John. They were with the Lord on the mount of transfiguration; they went with the Lord to the house of Jairus; and at the end, they were with the Lord in the garden of Gethsemane. Why did the Lord choose only these three from among the twelve disciples? Why did the Lord put them in a more noticeable position? The main reason was that God wanted to establish His works in the New Testament along three different lines. But was it enough to have only three lines? No, it was still not enough! In Acts the Lord brought in another minister besides these three. Who was this man? Was it Matthias? No, even though Matthias was chosen as an apostle by casting lots, he was not the minister. Who was chosen? Our beloved brother Paul was chosen. He was one specially chosen by the Lord. Although many people worked for the Lord in the New Testament, only these four occupy a unique position. There were none besides these four. According to the Bible, the order of these four is as follows: (1) James, (2) Peter, (3) Paul, and (4) John. This is the proper order of the Bible and is recognized by all believers. Today we cannot exhaust the deeper significance of these four lines, but we can consider a little about them. We cannot see everything thoroughly and clearly; but as long as we see a little, some help will be rendered in our walk on earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JAMES</H2><P>James is the most unnoticed one among the four. He never wrote an epistle. The book of James in the Bible was not written by him, but by the Lord's brother. Peter and John were both zealous men. We can see many accounts of their work, but James did not do anything special. He was a very hidden person. How could he be listed among these four? Why did the Lord choose him as one of the four to represent one special line? James did not manifest the gifts of preaching, healing, and works of wonders, etc. Although these gifts are good, James' outstanding trait was not in any of these things. What do we see in him? He did one thing that was great and extraordinary; he was the first martyr among the apostles! The most extraordinary and crucial line among these four is the line of suffering. No matter how different were the works of Peter, Paul, and John, there was one line common to them all, the line of suffering and rejection. Suffering is something that is basic to every Christian.</P><P>Today many people like to read Paul's excellent Epistles; they like to hear about Peter's zealous works and John's wonderful visions. Yet they toss James aside and subconsciously forget about him. They do not realize that every work should be based on James. Peter won three thousand people to the Lord in one day, and Paul established churches everywhere. Yet without James's suffering, the Lord could not be satisfied. When the Lord came to this world, He took the standing of one who was rejected. If we do not suffer with Him, we cannot satisfy His heart no matter what wonderful things we do.</P><P>Why did the Lord make James so hidden? He only wanted to highlight one special point of James. Suppose we have many chairs, several lamps, and numerous desks here. We are accustomed to seeing them and do not feel anything special about them. But if the items are moved away one day and the place is cleaned so that only one small desk remains, every brother would immediately notice the small desk. If a crowd is here, you would not notice anything, but once all the people are gone and only one person is left, he will draw considerable attention. This is what the Lord did. He hid every gift of James and only highlighted his suffering. In the Bible Peter said to arm ourselves with a mind to suffer (1 Pet. 4:1). Only suffering overcomes everything and accomplishes God's eternal purpose. Brothers, let me say an honest word. Those who do not want to suffer with the Lord can never expect to be exalted with Him. Only those who suffer are worthy of being exalted. If you want to be highly exalted, you have to follow James's footsteps.</P><P>There is more truth concerning James which can render us much help. However, because of time, I cannot go further. Now let us take a look at Peter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PETER</H2><P>Before we speak about what Peter represents, let us consider the difference between Peter, Paul, and John. Even though we may speak a little here and a little there, and even though it may not be very organized, nevertheless, what we say is very crucial. We do not intend to speak eloquently, but intelligibly.</P><P>Peter's work was totally different from Paul's. We only need to look at the Gospels of Mark and Luke and at Acts, and we will find an obvious difference. Mark received his Gospel from Peter, and Luke wrote down his story from Paul. Look again at Peter's testimony at Pentecost and Paul's testimony; each one has its own emphasis, and they are not the same. John's work also stands apart. The Lord's gift to John was different from the gifts to Paul and to Peter. What was Peter's testimony? If we look at Matthew 16 and Acts 2, we know that what he did concerned only one thing-the kingdom of God. His line was characterized by the kingdom of God. What about Paul? I think everyone who has read Paul's Epistles can see that Paul was concerned only about God's house. In other words, he was concerned with God's church. All the testimony and work of Paul, throughout his lifetime, were on this one thing. When we consider John, we can see that his testimony was completely different. He never talked about the things regarding the church. Although Peter did not talk about the church extensively, he mentioned the overseers a little. But he did not mention anything about church organization. Neither did John say a word about church organization. John only spoke about fathers, young men, and little children. What is this? This is the testimony of God's family.</P><P>There are three clear lines before us: (1) Peter, on God's kingdom, (2) Paul, on God's house, and (3) John, on God's family. If you understand these three lines clearly, God will give you more light. This does not mean that Peter did not mention anything that John mentioned. He briefly mentioned God's house. But his main emphasis was on God's kingdom. At the same time, Paul also mentioned something about God's family, and John mentioned something about God's kingdom. But as far as their focus, Paul focused on God's church and John focused on God's family. These three lines are not absolutely distinctive, yet each one has its own specialty. Because the scope of today's topic includes the whole New Testament, I cannot speak in detail. I can only touch the subjects briefly.</P><P>Peter was the initiator. The first one in the church of Christ to open his mouth was Peter. The last one who spoke was John. Revelation, which was written by John, is the last book among the sixty-six books of the Bible. What about Paul? He was between Peter and John; he was a predecessor and a successor. There is God's kingdom and God's family; in between there is God's house. This is what God established in the Bible. It is a pity that today many people are still ignorant about the kingdom of God and the family of God. They are equally ignorant about the church of God. They only know about man's organization and denominations. If you ask people about the difference between God's kingdom, God's house, and God's family, they think that these are more or less the same. They think that once a person joins the church, he enters God's family which also means that he enters God's kingdom. They do not realize that there is a big difference between these three things. That is why God needs a Peter, a Paul, and a John to express His kingdom, house, and family.</P><P>When the Lord gave the keys of the kingdom of the heavens to Peter, it meant that Peter was the one to open the doors, first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles. We will talk about this later. But now we want to point out that since the keys of the kingdom of the heavens were put into Peter's hand, he must have been the first to enter into the kingdom of the heavens. The keys were in his hand and he kept them. If the key to our hall in Wen-teh Lane is in my hand, no matter how early you come, you will have to stand outside the iron door. Before you enter, you will have to wait until I open the door with the key and enter. Without the key, you cannot enter first. In the same way, the first to enter the realm of the heavenly kingdom was Peter. This is very clear.</P><P>In Matthew 16, the Lord spoke a marvelous thing to Peter. What did He say? He said, "And upon this rock I will build My church...I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens" (vv. 18-19). Brothers and sisters, do you realize what is different about verse 19? Oh! The greatest door handle is here. The Lord gave Peter the keys of the kingdom of the heavens. Peter could control the timing for the opening of the door of the kingdom of the heavens. He bore the responsibility of the kingdom of the heavens. But what about the church? The Lord said, "And upon this rock I will build My church." The Lord will build the church Himself; no one else can touch the church. This is the most distinctive difference between the kingdom of the heavens and the church. What is the kingdom of the heavens? It is God's spiritual domain on earth. God's kingdom is the manifestation of God's sovereignty and His administration. God's house represents God's nature in its glory, love, and righteousness. God's family expresses God's love and His relationship with us. All these stand complete in themselves. They are not the same. Many people lump everything into the church. They think this belongs to the church and that also belongs to the church. They drag everything into the church, as if the church is a warehouse in which they can store everything. This proves that they do not understand the truth of the Bible.</P><P>Peter only bore the testimony of the kingdom of the heavens, which was to open the door and let people in. We need to pay attention to John 3:5. What did the Lord say there? He said, "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." If we had written this verse, we would have written it, "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the family of God." But no, it says the kingdom of God. Whoever enters into the kingdom of God must be born again. Only those who are born again can enter into the kingdom of God. The keys that Peter used at Pentecost were repentance and baptism. As a result, three thousand people entered into the kingdom of God. This was the beginning of God's kingdom. Many people say that the church started at Pentecost. This is correct, but they forget that the kingdom of God also started at Pentecost. What Peter said later in the Epistles about salvation and reward refers to the future kingdom. There was no contradiction between the future kingdom and the entrance into the kingdom of God at Pentecost.</P><P>Was the work of Pentecost enough? No! God had to send Peter to the house of Cornelius. At Pentecost Peter exercised the keys and ushered many Jews into the kingdom. God also wanted him to open the door for Gentiles to enter into the kingdom of God. This fulfilled the Lord's word in Matthew 8:11, which says that there would be many people from the east and from the west, who would recline at table in the kingdom of the heavens. Before Peter exercised the keys to open the door for Gentiles to be saved, God prepared Paul. Dispensationally speaking, Peter's work ended at the house of Cornelius. After this, although Peter still bore many testimonies, his work was dispensationally over. Consider how wonderful this is! In Acts 10, Peter went to the house of Cornelius, but Paul repented in Acts 9.</P><P>Originally, Paul was a zealous persecutor of the Lord. But on his way to Damascus, the Lord shined a light around him and he received grace. However, his eyes were not yet opened. The Lord sent Ananias, telling him that Paul was the vessel He had chosen. This word expressed the Lord's heart. The kingdom of God was large, and Peter had brought in many people. However, there was still the need for a manager and designer. Therefore, the Lord raised up Paul and made him a vessel. Ananias put it very well when he said, "Saul, brother." This meant that every hatred was removed. Consequently, Paul was able to testify for the Lord and be useful for the work. Later, his work extended from inside the city to outside the city; the scope of his work expanded. How did he get down from the wall? He was let down by the disciples. Although he could have climbed down by himself, he did not. He was willing to have the disciples let him down. This was brotherly fellowship, help, and approval. Paul did not go out alone; he was backed up by others' participation. So many works can be more effectual if they are backed up by others' prayer and help. When Paul originally went to Jerusalem, the disciples were somewhat fearful. Later Paul was able to go in and out among them; there was full fellowship between them with no obstacles. In this way, he was able to continue Peter's work.</P><P>Now let us come back to Peter. When the Lord called him to the house of Cornelius, he did not want to go at first. Then the Lord gave him the vision of a great sheet descending from heaven. Inside there were animals, reptiles, and birds, but no fish. Why were there no fish? We see animals, reptiles, birds, and fish all the time. Why were only three things mentioned, the animals, the reptiles, and the birds, and the fish were omitted? According to the type in the story of Noah's ark, fish were never saved. The creatures saved through the ark did not include fish. This is why fish were not included in the things God gave to Peter.</P><P>What is the meaning of the great sheet with animals, reptiles, and birds? Let us consider this. The great sheet represents Peter's whole work. The extent of Peter's work was not like a vessel which can only contain a certain amount. It was not like a ship which has its limits. It was like a piece of cloth, a great sheet. What is cloth? Cloth does not have a fixed shape. It has not yet been formed into any shape; it is only a piece of fabric. Who came to make this fabric into something with a shape? Paul came. He specialized in the work of tidying up. We may liken Peter to a person who buys cloth and Paul to a tailor or dressmaker. We should be clear about this. Throughout his life, Peter's work was like a piece of cloth; it was not limited and it did not have any form or boundary.</P><P>Let us consider the three things in the great sheet. Birds are the most active animals. Sometimes they fly around, sometimes they rest upon branches or rooftops, and sometimes they take a few steps on the ground. They are the most free and not restricted at all. They are the wildest of all animals. What about animals? They are ferocious and vicious. What about reptiles? They refer to filthiness. In God's eyes, Gentiles are merely animals, reptiles, and birds. But now God has wrapped up the wild, vicious, and filthy ones in a great sheet. He has put us in a new environment. He no longer considers us as animals, reptiles, and birds. In the Bible there is only the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens; there is no such thing as the gospel of the church. We do not hear the gospel and then enter into the church. Rather, we hear the gospel and enter into God's kingdom, which is a new sphere and a new realm. Once you were under Satan's hand; now you are under God's hand. What does it mean to be saved? It means that God puts you in a new position. Today many people make the matter of the church too encompassing. They think that they have everything once they enter into the church, but they forget the matter of entering into the kingdom of God. Being saved does not mean entering into only the church; it also means entering into the kingdom of God to become His children, not by power, but by authority (John 1:12). Everyone can enter because it is not according to what a person does, but according to the authority that God has given to him. All of Peter's work was to bring something from the outside to the inside. In other words, Peter's work was to bring people into the kingdom of God. The meaning of entering into the kingdom of God is to be subject under God's sovereignty. Peter's specialty was to draw people and bring in group after group. When he drew one person in, another citizen was added to God's kingdom. However, he could do nothing to help those who were in the kingdom and needed direction. Paul picked up this responsibility. Paul's work was to help settle down those whom Peter drew in. Can you find the words "born again" in Paul's Epistles? No, he spoke about justification; he never spoke about being born again. What about Peter? He talked about regeneration. He also mentioned "inheritance." Paul only mentioned "inheritance" a little. John did not mention anything about it because his focus was on God's family. The simplest explanation of God's kingdom is that it is the sphere of God's rule.</P><P>Acts mentions many things concerning God's kingdom. Even Paul mentioned God's kingdom because at that time many people were saved and had entered into God's kingdom. It would be much better if we were clear about this on the day we were saved. The reason we are in such a degraded condition now is that we have made ourselves the center. The Lord only considers us as a helper. God truly wants to give us blessings. But more importantly, He wants us to enter His kingdom and be under His ruling. O brothers and sisters, salvation is not for our enjoyment; it is for God to deal with us according to His sovereign authority. Originally you lived a carefree and foolish life; now God wants you to be subject to Him. After a person is saved, he cannot live a loose life any longer. Instead, he must be restricted. Salvation is taking up the Holy Spirit as your yoke. When you want to be saved, He puts this yoke upon you. Once you have the yoke, you are a saved person. From a human point of view, when God saves a person, everything that he receives is not all good because God wants to bring him under His sovereignty. This was Peter's work. No matter what you are-animal, reptile, or bird-he took everyone into the kingdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PAUL</H2><P>Paul continued Peter's work. This is why he said he was a master builder to build up the house. We all know that many teachings, doctrines, and expressions of God's purpose are found in Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians. The main subject of Ephesians is God's house. Things had been brought into the house from the outside; now there was the need to put them in order and decorate the house. All of Paul's work was for the purpose of decoration. For example, the book of Romans deals with justification, victory, and obedience. These are not ways to enter into God's kingdom. They are just the carvings, the modifications made on the model. Paul's concluding word is an exhortation to offer oneself and turn fully to God. In the books to the Corinthians, Paul went on to tell us what we should do after we have become subject to God and have entered into God's kingdom. He began to tell us about things related to the meetings, the Lord's table, marriage, communication, receiving, fellowship, and many other procedural matters. He was holding his scissors and was ready to cut some cloth to shape it into some unique form according to specific guidelines. Everything in the house has to be placed in the proper place. What does this mean? This means that the house must be arranged to the point where it will express God's nature. Whether a man is clean or dirty can be shown by the way he manages his house. A person's house is a representation of his character. No other place can expose a person more thoroughly and clearly than his own house. Suppose the books on your shelves are in chaos, and fruit peelings, seeds, and garbage are all over the floor. Suppose the beds are not made in the morning but are piled up like lumps of dough, and the desk is covered with a thick layer of dust. If one of your friends comes in to look at your room, he will clearly see what kind of person you are. You are not exposed when you go to another person's home; but in your own house everything expresses your entire being and naturally exposes your true self. Because your house is the place where you rest and the place in which you abide, you are exposed clearly and thoroughly there. Peter's testimony makes you a person of God's kingdom; it brings you under the authority of God's mighty hand. Peter did not care about the details. There was no need for him to take care of those things that were not within the scope of his work. Paul was the one who followed Peter and took care of this work. Look how detailed Paul was in his work. He mentioned how a husband and a wife should love each other, how a master and servant should treat each other, how brothers should love each other, and so forth. All these matters are in regard to the things a person ought to do in God's house; they show us what is acceptable to God. Not only did he deal with the earthly things, but he also dealt with the things concerning spiritual fellowship, such as meetings, baptism, gifts, the Lord's table, ministry, and all the arrangements within the church. He was indeed a designer and decorator.</P><P>Ephesians 2:22 says, "You also are being built together into a dwelling place of God." We see clearly from this verse that the church is the house of God. Each believer is a part of this house, being knit together to become a house. Every person is like a piece of brick, wood, or tile; everyone should manifest the nature of God before he can be built up to become God's house. God put this before us to show us that, as pieces of wood in God's house, we should fulfill our duty and express God's nature.</P><P>After we have Peter's foundation and Paul's building, is this enough? Are the things of God completed simply by the two lines represented by these two men? No! Another one, John, comes in.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOHN</H2><P>John spoke about our relationship with God. These are things that concern the family of God. His testimony was full of life, and he never spoke about anything outward. Can you find anything in his letters that speaks about the way to be an elder, the way to pay taxes, or the way a woman should cover her head? Regarding individual behavior, the only thing he said was that we should love one another; he said nothing else. Simply stated, John's testimony was fully in the Holy of Holies, full of spiritual reality. He never touched outward matters. He kept speaking about the things which are true, the deepest things. This is why the word life appears frequently in his Epistles and in Revelation. His specialty was to recover matters after they failed. This is because at the time John wrote his Epistles, apostasies abounded. Many false prophets and false Christs had arisen. Men had overthrown God's kingdom and taken God's house as their own. They held onto only superficial forms and had no reality. Therefore, John came to speak about the inward thing, life. Men can overthrow God's kingdom or God's house, but life can never be overthrown; it will always be there. Once a person has this reality, it is enough. John's testimony is for the latter days and leads men to their innermost being to see what kind of God we have.</P><P>I will briefly analyze these three lines. Peter spoke about a new realm, Paul spoke about new laws, and John spoke about a new relationship, which is the relationship between father and sons. How many times did he mention fathers, young men, and little children in his Epistles? All these are members in a family and are related to each other. Paul spoke about the laws in the new position, how to be subject to God and express God's nature. John simply talked about fathers, young men, and little children. What is this? This is the growth in God's family. The whole New Testament can be divided into these three lines. To find the line of the kingdom, we only have to read Matthew, 1 and 2 Peter, Mark, and a part of Hebrews. To find the line of the church, Paul's Epistles are the most complete. At the same time, John's Epistles are all on God's family. I must clarify, however, that this classification is not absolute. I am simply pointing out the areas that each one stressed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEGINNING AND ENDING</H2><P>Let us consider how these three lines begin and end. What was Peter doing when God called him? He was casting a net into the sea with his brother Andrew. What about John? He was mending a net on a ship. It is quite marvelous that God had properly arranged their works when they were called. Peter was casting a net when he was called; later he did the work of casting a net. His work was to charge forward to the front of the battlefield. He started the work with the Jews. He was also the first to preach to the Gentiles. He cast a net and caught many Jews. He cast another net and caught many Gentiles. But later the net (in man's view) was broken, and the kingdom was forsaken by the people. Fish were leaking out. Therefore, God called John to mend the net and recover it back to the original new condition.</P><P>Let us see what God appointed for Paul when he was called. When Paul was about to persecute the believers, God shined a light on him on his way to Damascus. Paul's first words were, "What shall I do?" (Acts 22:10). His work always involved "what to do." He was not like Peter, who in one day led three thousand or five thousand people to believe in God. He saved only a few or, at the most, a few dozen because his purpose was not to draw people in but to perfect people. The subject of his work was how-to: how to do things right, how to build a house, how to arrange its contents, how to trim the cloth. These were his works. His occupation was tent-making. A tent is a place for a man to dwell. Spiritually speaking, Paul was also a tent-maker. Unlike Peter, who only had a piece of cloth, Paul's cloth became a tent.</P><P>But what was men's attitude toward the works of these three persons? It was not good at all! It was very bad! We all will sigh. At the end of their days, men rejected their testimony. Second Peter shows us this matter clearly. In chapter two, the false prophets came. They came especially to do a counterfeit work. Therefore, Peter described them as dogs and sows; they made things worse and caused God's kingdom to be concealed. In chapter three, the mockers came. They despised what Peter preached, treating it as a loathsome and shameful thing! The testimony of the kingdom was completely rejected. Do you know why Peter wrote his second Epistle? It was written because the first Epistle had been rejected and thrown away. This is why he had to write his second Epistle. He described in his second Epistle the final condition of his lifetime testimony. It exposed and proclaimed all of men's rejection. The situation was bad in Peter's time. How much worse has it become in the twentieth century! There is hardly anyone who does not oppose the testimony of the kingdom when they hear about it. There is hardly anyone who does not say that we are foolish. No wonder so many people promote the so-called ideal kingdom; no wonder the counterfeit truth is everywhere. Oh, they were there in Peter's days! It is not surprising or uncommon that they are here today.</P><P>Not only did Peter's testimony end this way; Paul's testimony ended the same way. The last Epistle written by him was 2 Timothy. Three to five years after writing it, he died. We can see from this Epistle the condition that existed at the end of his life. He said, "All who are in Asia turned away from me" (2 Tim. 1:15). It was too difficult to manifest the Lord; there were too many restrictions, and it was indeed unbearable. Brothers and sisters, at the time of Paul's and Peter's death, the church was fully degraded in its outward form. It had fallen into the condition described in Revelation 2 and 3. How much worse is the situation today! The Epistle to the Philippians was written by Paul when he was old. What did he say? He said that everyone was after their own things (Phil. 2:21). Men put Paul's testimony aside. They considered their own things to be too important. As a result, they gave up the Lord. If a person takes care of himself, he cannot take care of the Lord. Since he does not have enough time to take care of his own business, he has even less time to take care of the Lord's business. There is nothing else he can do except to ignore the Lord's business! Paul's testimony was rejected and forsaken. Therefore, his last words were to exhort the saints to be watchful and be constantly aware of the intrusion of heresies. Paul's testimony ended this way.</P><P>It seems that the testimonies had completely failed in their outward appearance. So the Lord needed to use John. The Lord needed him to take care of the inner works. Consider the Gospel of John. It is not like Matthew's which emphasized doctrines, or like Luke's which stressed morality, or like Mark's which recorded history. John only wrote about the relationship between God and us, a relationship between father and sons. He did not begin his Gospel with Adam or Abraham but with Jesus Christ from the beginning, from the very first beginning. He began this way because outward appearances had failed and neither Adam nor Abraham could turn the situation back. What was needed was that which was from the beginning. Who can shake the beginning? No one can. The beginning can never be shaken. Whatever comes from God can never be shaken. The Gospel of John is on the Word from the beginning, which was expressed in order to lead us back to the condition of the beginning. What was there in the beginning? There was life, light, and love. None of these things can be shaken. Rather, they are the inward realities. John never talked about outward things such as husbands and wives, masters and servants, meetings, and so forth. He never mentioned these things. What he mentioned was just the things on God's side which are absolutely inward. If we do not see this difference, we will not see anything. We still need to beseech God earnestly until we see the difference.</P><P>O brothers and sisters, because all things have failed and the church has outwardly fallen into desolation and division, may God grant us grace so that we can turn back to John. Otherwise, everything will be in vain. This does not mean that the works of Peter and Paul are not needed, but at the present time, the urgent need is not for outward things. We must first have the inward reality; then we can have the outward things. We should realize and understand that the net has been broken. The fish can no longer be kept in the net. Therefore, God wanted John to mend this net. He did not patch on something new or invented. Instead, it was there from the beginning. This is why he said, "What I give to you is what you have known already." It was not something they did not know, but something that they knew and had forgotten.</P><P>What is it to mend? Mending is not replacing the broken net with a new one, but restoring the broken one to its original condition. In other words, mending is covering the hole with a piece of the original material. Today we mainly need to return to God, gain life and spiritual power, and learn to overcome the world and the enemy. This is a spiritual reality. We need to take hold of John's testimony first. Then we can go back to the testimony of Paul and then Peter. If we do not come back to John first, we will not be able to come back to Peter. Since the net has been broken, how can we use it for catching fish? This is why we have to mend the net first by holding onto the reality, before we can do anything else.</P><P>Finally, let us pay attention to three verses in particular. "Another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go" (John 21:18). This is the way the Lord Jesus spoke concerning Peter's end. Peter was such a brave and strong person! According to tradition, he was put on a cross upside down for the Lord's sake. How brave he was! But what did the Lord say? He said that Peter would be bound and taken to a place where he did not want to go. Eventually, the Catholic Church declared that he had been a pope. They say that He sat on a throne in Rome. A huge edifice has the name "St. Peter's Cathedral" written on it. Throughout history, many great persons have flattered, exalted, and applauded him! But would Peter have wanted to be treated in this manner? He would have been extremely unhappy and unwilling. He could never have imagined that he would have been so glorified today. He would never have sat on such a great throne. But he has no say in this matter; he has been bound by the people. His sovereignty has been usurped by nations and individuals. His testimony has been completely buried by them. O brothers! How many people today know that Peter has been bound? They consider salvation to only be liberating and joyful thing. Salvation is truly liberating and joyful. But salvation is not for the enjoyment of pleasure, or to do things according to one's own choice. Rather, it is being subject to God's authority. Only when a person is subject to God's authority will everything be right.</P><P>Let us consider Paul's end. "And he remained two whole years in his own rented dwelling" (Acts 28:30). His life ended in a worse manner than Peter's. He even had to rent a house for himself. He could have lived in Ephesus or Corinth. But he had to rent a house because he had no permanent place of his own. His testimony was rejected, and he had to stay in his rented house and not come out. Previously, Paul could go somewhere and find someone to preach to, but now people had to go to his place. Unless they had a heart to go, they could never hear his preaching. Whether or not they believed, Paul could not bother them any longer. They had to make their own choice. Paul was pushed down by men in high positions and kept in a prison in Rome. People had to seek him out personally before they could see his face. Many people today can only recite the "Lord's Prayer" and the creeds of the denominations. But these are "their own houses"; they are not Paul's house. It is not enough to merely have some mint and anise outwardly (Matt. 23:23). We have to dig into the true meaning of Paul's Epistles. The Epistles to the Corinthians were not just for the Corinthians, but for all the churches. Oh! Paul is covered up by men and cannot come out any longer. Let us look for him quickly and seek the truth of his testimony. Do not allow this testimony to pass by in a vague way. I want to say an honest word: all those who do not want to make the effort will never find Paul. Those who do not pay a price will never find the truth.</P><P>Finally, let us come to John. He was exiled to an island. What is an island? An island is different from a sea and also different from land. It is not the sea because it is isolated in the sea, nor is it land because it is not connected to the mainland. It is separated not only from the sea but also from land. It is a solitary place. What is the sea? The sea is the world! The land is today's human religion and organization! An island is not connected to either of them. God is not in the world; neither is He in great human organizations. The best achievements of man are just a big piece of land. God put John on an island, not in the world or in a human organization. Instead, He put him on an island. Was he lonely there? Surely he was lonely! He had neither the joy of the world as a surging tide, nor the secure peace of the land. He surely was very lonely. But John was marvelously touched by the Spirit on the Lord's Day; he saw a great vision, heard the Lord Jesus' voice, and was caught up to the heavens. What a wonderful thing! Though he did not have the joy of the sea or the comfort of land, he had the Lord's comfort and was satisfied. No one connected to the sea and the land is able to be connected to the Lord. If a Christian treasures his position and reputation in religion, he will never go to an island.</P><P>O brothers and sisters! The Lord is calling for us to go to the island. He wants us to give up all the outward things willingly and come to Him alone. On the island there is no ship to take us out to sea, nor a bridge for us to cross to the land. But the Holy Spirit will carry us away. There are no exits on any side, but the way upward is clear. If the way upward is not clear, you will need ships to go on the sea or bridges to go to the land. If you have these other ways, you can never stay on the island or be caught up to the heavens. Oh! We should go back to John first and stand on reality. Then we can go back to the works of Peter and Paul. We need to learn how to be on the island, in the house, and bound. May the Lord bless us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NUMBERING OF SPIRITUAL DAYS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 47</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 4:17-22; 5:4-21; 11:31-32; 12:4; 16:16; 17:1, 25; 25:7; 35:28-29; 47:9, 28; Exo. 12:2; Lev. 27:3-7; Deut. 1:2; Josh. 14:10; Matt. 20:3, 6; John 13:30; 1 Cor. 3:1-2; Acts 13:36; Rev. 2:10; 3:11; 1 Kings 6:1 (cf. Acts 13:18-22); Joel 2:25</H1><P>You may think that we have read too many verses today. Actually, there are not that many. We only read a few of the verses in the Bible that have to do with time. Our goal is to see what God says about time and how He numbers our spiritual days. One interesting thing is that in Genesis 4 and 5, which we have just read, there are two genealogies. In chapter four there is the genealogy of Cain; in chapter five there is the genealogy of Seth. Adam had three famous sons (although he had begotten more than three). They were Cain, Abel, and Seth. Abel died in his youth and had no genealogy. As for Adam's other two sons, the Bible records both of their genealogies. In chapters four and five we see two groups of people begetting generation after generation. One group, including Lamech and Tubal-cain, came out of Cain. The other group descended from Seth; Abraham, Moses, and Christ were all his descendants. You can see these two branches continuing to propagate. Cain's genealogy is recorded in chapter four, and Seth's genealogy is recorded in chapter five. They are similar. One genealogy tells us who begat whom, and who begat whom. The other also tells who begat whom, and who begat whom. However, there is one big difference. That is, in chapter four it only says that Cain begot Enoch, and Enoch begot Irad, and so forth. It does not tell us how many years Cain lived; there is altogether no record of their days on earth. Chapter five is different. Not only does it mention "births," but it also mentions "deaths" and the ages of the people. Hence, chapters four and five are not quite the same. Chapter four purposely does not record the ages, not because they are forgotten. Chapter five clearly records men's ages; it tells us who lived to what age, and begat whom, and then lived on for how many more years. Then it tells us the total number of years that such a person lived. We saw that Adam is recorded in chapter five. It says that he lived nine hundred thirty years. From Adam and Seth to Noah, the genealogy was clearly recorded. This is the basic difference between these two chapters.</P><P>Why is there this difference? In God's eyes, Cain had no years that could be countable. Perhaps he was married at age fifty, gave birth to a son at age sixty, and lived until he was six hundred years old. But God made no account of Cain and forgot him. In God's eyes, this person had never lived. He was dead. Even when he was living, he was still dead. Therefore, only his birth (which is equivalent to his death) was recorded, and his actual death was not recorded. Since he had not lived before God, there was nothing countable, and there was no death. Who do the men in chapter four represent? They represent those who have not been born again, those who are dead in Adam, have no life, and have no countable days. The men in chapter five represent those who are in the Lord. The name Seth means a replacement. Because Abel died, Seth was appointed to replace Abel. This shows that only those who are born again have countable days.</P><P>We have also read another verse, Exodus 12:2: "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you." God told the Israelites to rename their month. They were to rename the current month as their first month. Have you ever heard of people renaming the months? We have heard of the renaming of years but not of the renaming of months. For example, during the various Chinese dynasties, the years were named according to the name of the reigning monarch. When one king passed away, the name of the years was changed. When the Republic of China came into existence, the name of the year changed again. For example, today is the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. We call a year the first year because a new beginning has come. However, no one ever renames the months. Yet the Bible renamed the months. It might have been the fifth month, and God changed it to the first month. Why did He do this? He did it because the Israelites left Egypt, the Passover Lamb was slain, and the Israelites were freed from the hands of Pharaoh. Why did the months have to be renamed? They were renamed because this was the beginning of a spiritual history.</P><P>Do you have a spiritual history? Today among us some may be quite old; some may even have grandchildren. However, I want to ask you, have you been born again? If you have not been born again, in God's eyes you are not even a month old. You may be fifty or sixty years old physically, yet your first spiritual month has not started thus far! If the Israelites had not left Egypt, if they had not escaped from the bondage of Pharaoh, if they had not struck the blood on their door posts and escaped the punishment of God, they would not have had a first month before God. Therefore, the beginning of our spiritual history starts with the blood. Please remember that the day that you accept the precious blood is the day of your new beginning. If that day has not yet come, you have no days before God thus far. There is a question we always like to ask: "How many births do you have? How many births have you celebrated?" If you say only one, then I fear for you. You need two births. It is not bad for our wretched body (which becomes the temple of God after our regeneration) to have one birthday. However, we need another birthday. I am afraid that there are some of you who have had only one birth. Such people do not have a first month; they are like Cain who had no days before God. He could have lived for five hundred or seven hundred years, and he might have achieved many things, yet none of these are countable. When the Israelites were in Egypt, God did not count their days. The month they left Egypt was counted as their first month. Therefore, the counting of our spiritual days begins with our regeneration and salvation.</P><P>One day I was conversing with a brother, and I asked him a question. It was strange that Paul asked Timothy, who was quite young, to ordain elders. Are not elders supposed to be quite elderly? How could he, being so young, ordain elders? Is this not illogical? How could Timothy ordain elders? Please remember that God has a different way of numbering a person's days. You may be sixty years of age but have had only one month before the Lord; or you may be twenty years of age and have had only ten years before the Lord. Your days are counted from the time you are saved. The days before you were saved were not counted; they were put aside. Today I am not talking about your years before you were saved and how they were not counted. Therefore, I will only say this much.</P><P>Now let me say a few words to the believers. Not only are the days before a person's salvation not counted; even after a person is saved and believes in the Lord, not every single day is counted. You may have believed in Him for five years, but that does not mean that you are five years old. Please remember that the number of years is one thing, and age is another thing. This does not make sense according to the world's mentality. However, it is quite true in the spiritual sense. You may have been born again for fifty years and not be fifty years of age.</P><P>Did we not just read two verses that we can use as a comparison? Let us read it again carefully that we may understand how God numbers days. Let us read Acts 13:18-22 very carefully and see how many years there were between the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and the time that Solomon built the temple. Paul said, "And for a time of about forty years He carried them as a nurse in the wilderness...And after these things, for about four hundred and fifty years, He gave them judges...and God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. And when He had deposed him, He raised up David for them as king [ for forty years]." How many years are there? Forty years plus four hundred fifty years is four hundred ninety years. Four hundred ninety years plus forty years twice is five hundred seventy years, which plus three years of Solomon's reign up to the time of the building the temple becomes five hundred seventy-three years. Therefore, from the time of Exodus to the fourth year of Solomon when he built the temple was five hundred seventy-three years.</P><P>Now let us see what is recorded in 1 Kings 6:1: "And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the Lord." Here it says four hundred eighty years, not five hundred seventy-three years. There is a difference of ninety-three years! There must be an error either with the book of Acts or with the book of the Kings. Otherwise, why would there be such a discrepancy of years? They both recorded the period from Exodus to Solomon's building of the temple. There must be an error in one of them, or both of them are wrong. But you cannot say that, because the spiritual principle in them is the same.</P><P>Let us read the record in Acts. Forty years in the wilderness is correct. Saul's reigning for forty years is also correct. David's forty years cannot be wrong. The temple was built in the fourth year of Solomon's reign; therefore, only three years were past when he built the temple. All these years cannot be wrong because the Israelites were reigning at that time. But during the age of the judges, the Israelites were captured several times. Let us see how many years they were captured away as slaves. Judges 3:8 says, "Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years." This was the first captivity which lasted for eight years. The second time was recorded in verse 14 of the same chapter: "So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years." "And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel" (4:2-3). This can be considered as the third captivity because the Israelites at that time did not have their own judges and were completely in the hands of the Gentiles. "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years" (6:1). This was the fourth time. Another time was recorded in 13:1: "And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years." The Israelites lost their freedom and had to serve the Gentiles altogether five times. How many years in total? Eight plus eighteen plus twenty plus seven, and finally another forty years must be added together. How many years are there altogether? Exactly ninety-three years, no more and no less. This matches the difference between Acts 13 and 1 Kings 6; both are ninety-three years. It is apparent that Paul counted those ninety-three years, but they were not recorded in the first book of the Kings. Therefore it has only four hundred eighty years, whereas it should have been five hundred seventy-three years!</P><P>Why were those ninety-three years not counted? There was a reason. Those were the lost years! Oh, whenever we are captured, lose our freedom, serve the Gentiles, and do not have our own judges are the times when we do not have any years to be counted. Now we have gone one step further. We see that not only were we dead before we were born again, but even after we are saved and have eternal life, God considers many days to be dead. Even if we have been redeemed and belong to God, if we are entangled by the world and sold to Moab, the days in which we do not freely serve the Lord are days when we cannot be considered as God's children, and they cannot be counted. The days when we are serving man but are not serving God are lost. We need to count from the day we were saved until now. How many days have we belonged to ourselves? How many days have we been free? How many days have we been controlled by others? How many days can be countable before God? Perhaps we may say that we have believed in the Lord for five or eight or ten years. Yet how many of these days were spent foolishly? How much time should be discounted? We have wasted too many days. Will these days before the Lord add up to even one year? The days that are spent according to our own will or the will of another, the days in which we fall away from God, will be forgotten. Oh, let us ask, "Have I spent any days before God? Do I have a beginning in the first month?" This is the first question. Then the second question is, "I have been born again for many years, yet how much time have I wasted? How much time is counted before God?" The days we spent as a slave and without fellowship are lost. How many days do we have before God? This is a matter of utmost importance!</P><P>Remember how Paul spoke to the Corinthians: "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it. But neither yet now are you able" (1 Cor. 3:1-2). This means that they had wasted many days. They had become aged children. Their ages had increased, yet they were still like children. They should have grown, yet they had not grown at all. Oh, the lost years! They should have become strong men, and they should have been able to run the course that lay ahead and eat solid food. They had wasted many days, and still they remained fleshy. In their daily walk, in their submission to the Lord and trust of the Lord, they should have had many experiences. They should have been able to guide others. However, they still did not know. We may have believed in the Lord for eight or ten years yet not progressed since the day we were born again. Therefore, the apostle said that even after we have been born again, there are many days that cannot be counted, and it is possible that we can remain as infants.</P><P>Please remember the parable of the Lord concerning laboring in the vineyard. The Lord went out several times to hire laborers. What did He say? "He went out...and saw others standing idle in the market place, and to those he said, You also go into the vineyard" (Matt. 20:3-4). To be idle means to stand inactive, not doing anything. The Lord wants you to work! Even when He went out at the eleventh hour, which is four or five in the afternoon, He still saw people standing there. The Lord said to them, "Why have you been standing here all the day idle?...You also go into the vineyard" (vv. 6-7). What is the meaning of these words? This is a parable. It says that for His work, God has set a boundary which is the vineyard. Outside of this boundary is idleness. It does not matter what you are doing outside. As long as you are outside, you are idle. You may have been the president of the government for many years, a professor for a long time, a good father for many years, or a good mother for many years. You may have been an excellent pastor or a missionary all your life. You may have spent your whole lifetime for the church and for spreading the gospel and heavenly kingdom. You may have even contributed greatly to the works of society; yet God says that you are idle. No matter how busy you are, if you are not living in the will of God, you are idle in the eyes of the Lord. It does not matter how much you have sweated. You may even claim that you have been busy working at home and do not have even one moment of free time, yet God says that you are an idle person.</P><P>Are men really idle, having nothing to do? No. There is not a person in this world who is not working. Everyone is extremely busy. Some are busy with their daily necessities. Some who are rich and have abundance are busy with earthly pleasures. Some are busy making their living, and others are busy with pleasures. There is no one who is not busy. Even many Christians are working zealously for the Lord. What then does God mean by being idle? It means to be outside the vineyard; anyone who is outside the vineyard is idle. Any works, activities, or labors that are outside of God's will are vanities. You may be working very busily in spiritual matters, but God will speak to you quietly, "Why are you idle? Any work outside of the vineyard is not mine." Therefore, in God's eyes you are extremely idle. Only those who are inside the vineyard belong to God. The whole question rests on whether or not a work is from God and whether or not it is for God. The days spent outside the will of God are not counted. As the Lord said to those people who came at five o'clock in the afternoon, "Why have you been standing here all the day idle?" (Matt. 20:6). For some, their entire life and all their years have gone by, and nothing is counted. "All the day" here means an entire life. Brothers and sisters, how about us? It does not mean that we should all give up our jobs to preach the gospel. This is not God's word. The most important thing is that every one of us, in whatever we do, should be fully clear that we are standing according to God's will. Let us do everything according to God's will and let the vineyard be our center. There are different types of work in the vineyard; they are not all the same. Some work involves digging the ground, other work involves sowing seeds, and other work involves repairing. Whatever work you are doing, it is all right as long as you are working for His vineyard. Some work is very dirty, such as preparing the fertilizer. Some work is cleaner, such as picking the grapes. Do not think that you have to be like certain ones in order to do God's work or that you have to do certain work in order for your labor to count. There is no such thing. Any time spent in the vineyard is countable.</P><P>You may have been saved for sixty years, fifty years, or for just three years or five years. How much time, energy, and money have you spent for the Lord? Undoubtedly, you have to work. But for whom are you working? It is all right for you to be involved in earthly matters as long as you are sure that you are in the will of God. God does consider those who do not have a job and just engage themselves in gospel preaching as the workers of the vineyard. Some may be doing "God's work," and yet it is not God's will. On the contrary, God has to call them to work. It is all a question of your heart and the will of God. Therefore, consecration is absolutely necessary. If you are saved but have not consecrated yourself, the life you live is considered idle. If you say that you have done nothing in saving souls, nor anything else for God since you were saved, your life must have been idle. This is the true accounting. The days that are lived for the self, that are lived in captivity or in sin, are not counted by God. How many years can you live on this earth? Seventy years? Eighty years? Not too many can live that long. Have you ever seen a Christian who is one hundred years old? Perhaps you have not. If you subtract the days before you were saved from your short life span, how many more days are left? Brothers, how many more years will you live? There may be sixty more years until that day. The Lord may say, "The days you have lived before me are less than ten years." Perhaps fifty years from now the Lord will say, "You have lived only a few days before me. The rest of the days have all been forgotten." Oh, may we number our days and use the rest of our days wisely!</P><P>Now, let me mention another matter briefly. This matter is not only mentioned in the New Testament but is exemplified in the Old Testament. One of the examples is Abraham. According to Acts 7, when Abraham was in Mesopotamia, that is, Ur, God appeared to him and charged him to leave his country, his kindred, and his father's house to go into Canaan. How did he respond? If he disobeyed, he would lose his peace. Yet he was not willing to obey to the end. He came to Haran and became "a halfway Christian." He not only went out himself, but he also brought along his nephew Lot and his father. God told Abraham to leave his kindred, but he brought them along. God told him to go to Canaan, but he went only to the border. He became a "borderline Christian." With many Christians, you cannot consider them totally cold because you can sense a little warmth in them. But you cannot consider them hot because they are not. It was the same with Abraham; he left Ur of the Chaldees but had not entered into Canaan. Today some may think that they are too spiritual for the world and too worldly for the Christians. In this way, they become borderline Christians.</P><P>However, we see that God again called Abraham after his father died (Gen. 12). This time, God did not call him from Ur but rather from Haran. God's will never wavers. Once it is spoken, it stands forever. God told Abraham that he should move to Canaan. The fact that he had moved to Haran did not change God's will. God called him the second time, and Abraham had to leave. Surprisingly, as soon as he started his journey from Haran, the Bible immediately recorded his age as being seventy-five (Gen. 12:4). His age was not recorded when he was in Ur or when he reached Haran. Only when he left Haran and entered into Canaan did the Bible record his age as being seventy-five. This shows us the beginning of his years. God does not count the days that are in the halfway state and in the border region. He demands that we surrender to Him absolutely. Oh, the days spent in Haran are the lost and forgotten days! If we desire God's blessings, we need to leave Haran. God does not count any days in which the self is mixed. I do not know indeed how many days I have lost, how many years I have lost. When I review my past history, I do not know how many days are to be condemned. God did not take notice of any time that was spent in Haran. We spend many days in a foolish way, in a way that is against our conscience and according to our own will. Many times we are lazy and only care for an easy life. All these are just Haran. All these are lost and become null and void. The counting begins at age seventy-five.</P><P>Unfortunately, this was not the only period that Abraham lost. The same thing happened again in chapter sixteen. In chapter fifteen God promised Abraham that he would have a son. In chapter sixteen he was influenced by his wife's suggestion and fell into a presumptuous sin before God. Her intention was good, and she tried to help God. She gave Hagar, her maid, to Abraham, and the latter bore him a son. This was the effort of the flesh and was not something from God. Interestingly, Abraham was recorded as being eighty-six years old in the last verse of chapter sixteen; in the first verse of chapter seventeen he was recorded as being ninety-nine years old. There is a total gap of thirteen years. During these entire thirteen years, not one incident was recorded, nor was any altar built. (Altars were often built by Abraham.) Also, there was no appearance, no new revelation, or any new promise. This period was the period when Ishmael grew up. Let us remember that anything which comes out of our own will and our own flesh is not counted by God and is lost. God began to keep record again at the age of ninety-nine. The entire thirteen years were lost, forgotten, spent in vain, and counted as nothing.</P><P>Let us ask ourselves whether or not during the last few years we have had any new experiences, any new light, or any new messages? In these last few years, did we save any souls or help anyone? Oh, let us consider! A few years have passed. Do we know God in a deeper way? Do we have a renewed assurance concerning God's promise? Do we have any new consecration toward God? Do we have any new altar that we built ourselves? Please remember that if the answers are no, all those days were lost. There is an elderly sister who is still alive today; the time that we can still be with her may not be too long. Once she said that with a Christian, every day he lives on earth should count, and that this is the way to gain the reward. Many times for us, ten days of living do not add up to one day. If we would only live daily by fulfilling our duty, everything would be all right. Please remember that this is a daily matter and cannot be treated lightly. If we live foolishly, rebelliously, sinfully, and act according to the self's will, this type of living in God's eyes is a waste of time and a squandering of our days. What a pity!</P><P>Why did God mention the age of ninety-nine? Because Abraham was circumcised during that year. Abraham had to experience circumcision. After one year, Isaac was born to him. We know that the meaning of circumcision is to rid oneself of the flesh. Therefore, the days in which the self and everything of the flesh had not been dealt with cannot be counted. Because Abraham received circumcision, he was counted again at the age of ninety-nine. Oh, many Christians today are extremely loose; they make light of their daily lives. But let us begin from today to strip off everything fleshly and offer all on the altar so that we will not live a life in vain again and not waste our days any longer. All those of us who are saved know that we have eternal life, but let us count our days and strive to gain back our precious moments. No doubt, we very much desire the return of our Lord. But if the Lord delays, let us count every one of our days. Do not let fifty years pass by and find out that forty-nine of them were lost. Oh, let us consider how many days we have spent in a foolish way. We do not know how many days there are left. Therefore, awake! We see from Abraham that many of his years were lost and gone. How wonderful it would be if he had not lost all those years!</P><P>It is most interesting to see the journey that the Israelites took in the wilderness. Recall the fact that the Israelites' journey from Egypt to Kadesh took only two years. This is recorded in Exodus 12 to Numbers 13. Due to their unbelief they did not enter into Canaan. They journeyed another thirty-eight years before they entered into Canaan. Those two years of journeying were normal but the thirty-eight years were just a waste. From Mount Horeb they circled around until they returned to the original place. We have also seen from the book of Deuteronomy that from Mount Horeb through Mount Seir to Kadesh-Barnea was a journey of only eleven days but it took them thirty-eight years to finish it. This circle was so large that they made their eleven-day journey in thirty-eight years! This was not three years or five years. All the time they circled around; there was no beginning and no end. This is the experience of many Christians. Some problems can be solved in three to five days, but they wait three to five years and the problems remain unsolved.</P><P>According to our knowledge, from the time Paul went to preach in Corinth to the time he wrote 1 Corinthians there was a span of only a few years. In that time, Paul hoped that they would become spiritual and grown-up men. Seeing that they remained as infants after these years disappointed Paul. It seems that he was saying, "It has been so long; it is already a few years!" From this we see that, according to Paul, being a spiritual man does not require a long period of time. It is not right to take three to five years. However, what is our point of view? When we see that a believer is living a foolish life, we make excuses for him, by saying, "Since he has only believed in the Lord for three or five years, how can he do what he is supposed to do?" However, Paul's view was totally different. After one year, a person should have the stature of a one-year-old. He should not take three to five years to do that. Three to five years after salvation is enough for a person to become a grown-up spiritual person. Unfortunately, in these days there are many fifty-year-olds who are still babies. They have never consecrated themselves and do not know what is meant by walking on the right path, seeking after God's will, or fellowshipping with God. They cannot help others. They read the Bible but do not have any light; they do not know how to lay hold of God's promises. Many have taken thirty-eight years to go through an eleven-day journey. These are the days that are forgotten and lost.</P><P>Every time I think of this matter, I become sorrowful and find the thought unbearable. However, I still thank the Lord who gives me comfort in my despair. In Joel 2:25 He said, "I will restore to you the years/That the swarming locust has eaten." Thank the Lord that He still has a way. You may be sixty years old this year and have wasted thirty or forty years. You may say, "What should I do about this today? I do not have a chance any longer. How much longer do I have to live? My strongest years have already been eaten up by Satan." What has been lost will never come back. This is like what Mr. Gladstone, a very famous politician in England, said in his old age to a young missionary, "Sir, you are still young. I give you my blessing for going again to preach the gospel in the foreign countries. Unfortunately, I am already old. Although I have succeeded to become the most important man on the political stage, and although I have been a pillar and have spent much time and energy for England, I regret the time spent in the past. If I had three lives, I would spend every one of them to preach the Word of God. Today I am unable to do so because the strongest and the best time of my life has been eaten up. Therefore, I encourage you to run for the Lord and gospel."</P><P>Once there was a young girl who fell into sin and contracted tuberculosis. She was dying in the hospital. An old servant of the Lord preached the gospel to her, telling her that the Lord Jesus had borne all her sin and persuading her to confess her sins, repent, and accept Jesus as her Savior. At first this girl resisted. She wondered how the Lord could forgive a sinner like herself. However, after she accepted the Lord, she was saved and became very happy, and peace filled her heart. After a few days, this old servant went to see her again. He was surprised to find her with a very sad face and very sorrowful. The servant asked her, "Why? Do not let Satan cheat you." She said, "No, I know that my sins have been forgiven." "Then why are you so sorrowful?" She answered sadly, "My years and days are almost finished. I am lying here, and I am about to die. When I stand in front of the Lord, the Lord may reckon me as saved. But what do I have to bring to Him? I can only tell the Lord that I have come empty-handed! How can I face my Lord with empty hands?" Truly, if the Lord takes you today, what do you have to bring to Him? Have you ever saved a soul? That is why this sister was very sad. The old servant said to her, "Sister, do not worry. I will take what you have just said and will write a song right next to your bed to encourage others to preach the gospel. In this way, all those who preach the gospel and save souls because of this song will share their rewards with you." He wrote the now well-known song: "Must I go, and empty-handed,/Thus my dear Redeemer meet?" Because of this song, many were touched to go out to preach the gospel. That is what the Lord means when He says, "I will restore to you the years/That the swarming locust has eaten,/The licking locust and the consuming locust and the cutting locust." Therefore, let us testify for Him today, serve Him, and recover the zeal which was in the beginning.</P><P>Ten years of a man's life on earth may be counted for only one day. But then one day may also be counted as one thousand days. David said that a day in the Lord's courts is better than a thousand. Therefore, our service is not in vain. The days in heaven are not measured by twenty-four hours. This is spiritual accounting. The way we reckon a day is not necessarily the same way God reckons it.</P><P>All those who are for the Lord are in the light; everything that does not have the Lord is filled with darkness. The most tragic verse in the whole Bible is John 13:30: "Having taken the morsel, he [Judas] went out immediately; and it was night." This is a very dark verse. Judas went out and left the presence of the Lord. It is forever a dark night when one betrays the Lord. From that day on, that man never saw day again; he never saw daylight, and everything for him was darkness. It is a very dangerous thing to leave the presence of the Lord. Whenever a person leaves the presence of the Lord, it is darkness for him.</P><P>Therefore, let each one of us consider how we are going to spend the rest of our days! May we not lose our days, but spend each day as a thousand. We should go on day by day and should never stop. Every step of our walk should be in the light of God's will, and we should not delay any longer. If we have fallen, we should rise up again right there. Let us remember that the fallen time is the lost time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT</H2><P>Concerning the ministry on the Notes on Scriptural Messages, I need to clarify a few things. Most of the manuscripts are notes on messages. Although I spent some time in correcting it, the contents and style are like the spoken form. If we intended to publish it in book form, we would have made it easier to understand, and fewer phrases would be missing. However, I can only admit that it has been impossible to rewrite them because of my busy schedule. Therefore, please excuse any mistakes found in structure and style.</P><P>March 24, 1934<br>Shanghai</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TEARS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 48</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Heb. 5:7</H1><P>Today we are going to study a certain subject or, we may also say, a certain thing. Every man has these things, but he does not have them all the time. It is something often done but not done at all times. What are these things? They are tears. I wonder if you know the importance of tears. If a person is able to shed tears, it is a good sign. Someone who had very deep spiritual experiences once said, "If you give your love to someone who cannot shed tears, you might as well ask a pickpocket to keep your purse for you." This is a true statement. If you give your love to someone who cannot shed tears, you will be as disappointed as if you asked a pickpocket to keep your purse for you. Tears are something that the world cannot do without. Anyone who cannot shed tears has lost his characteristic as a man and cannot be counted as a man.</P><P>I do not like to see men who are so proud that they consider shedding tears to be something that men should not do. Some even consider that it is a sign of courage not to shed tears. Some think that by not shedding tears, they appear to be better and more outstanding than others. I am afraid that this is not at all true! I would say rather that a dry eye indicates that there is a dry and hardened heart within such persons. It tells us that the heart is defiant, has no feeling, and is numb like wood and stone. Many times shedding tears reveals a person's heart. Nothing reveals what is in the heart as much as tears do. Therefore, tears are the outlet of the heart.</P><P>How do we know this? Suppose I am extremely sad today; I cannot sigh, talk, eat, sleep, or work. What should I do in order to alleviate my sorrow? Suppose you go to ask a physician if he has a cure for someone who is so sorrowful. If he understands psychology, he would say that such a one should have his best friend over for a heart-to-heart talk or for a few good jokes so that he can let out his frustrations. Perhaps he should visit a scenic place, take a walk in a grassy meadow, or listen to music that will cheer him up and cause him to forget whatever has made him sorrowful. But none of these things will work. If the doctor is experienced in human life, he would say, "Let him cry his heart out and everything will be solved." Whenever you are heavily pressed within and unable to be relieved, a few tears will vent your frustration and the whole thing will be over. It is quite amazing that something within your heart must come out through your eyes, as though the eyes are the outlet of the heart. Once the tears are shed, the heart is opened.</P><P>I remember that there was once a person with a physical handicap. He was quite angry about the defect in his body. Nothing seemed to please him, and he wanted to end his life. For seven years anger burned constantly within him like a flame. One day he went to a great concert. The whole audience thought the concert was marvelous, and their souls were all carried away into a rapturous and soothing ecstasy. But what did this one do? He shed a few tears. Someone asked him, "Was not today's music beautiful? Why did you shed tears?" He replied, "Before the concert I was bored and very, very sad. But after listening to the music and shedding some tears, everything is all right." The music punctured a hole in his heart so that the tears were able to flow out. Originally, depression locked up his heart. When the tears flowed out, his depression was washed away with the tears. The human side of his nature was expressed. In the beginning, his nature was bound and locked up by his depression; but now it was released by tears. The shedding of tears shows a man that he still has his human nature within. Through tears, a man is made human. Some people consider tears to be a sign of weakness. No! On the contrary, the inability to shed tears means that a man lacks humanity or has buried his humanity.</P><P>Tears are the common portion of men on earth. For this reason, our Lord also shed tears. Though the Bible records His joy, it never records His laughter. On the contrary, it records His tears. In Hebrews 5:7 we see that the Lord's tears are plural. This shows us that He often shed tears. Isaiah 53 also says that He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.</P><P>Tears are very precious because only tears can wash man's eyes and make them clean. There is so much dust, dirt, and filth on this earth. These things are ready at any moment to invade your eyes. Fortunately, there are always tears to wash your eyes and give you clear eyesight. If the eyes did not have tears, I am afraid that no one could see anything through his eyes.</P><P>Tears have a cleansing function, not only in the physical realm, but also in the spiritual realm. A few more tears allow a person to see a little more clearly. Without tears our spiritual eyes will lose their function. Once Mr. Panton spoke to a young couple, "Although you are so good, you lack one thing. If you could do this thing, you would be perfect. You should pray for the Lord's soon return." That evening the husband told his wife, "This time we must listen to the word of this old gentleman. Tonight we must pray for this matter thoroughly." The husband prayed faithfully and hoped that his wife would pray after him. But she would not because she confidently said within herself, "I have a wonderful family. Our marriage relationship is harmonious and happy. Our living is quite pleasant, and our house is quite comfortable. Everything is wonderful. Why should I ask the Lord to come back soon? Let us not be in a rush." This continued for seven months until suddenly her husband died. Later on when she saw Mr. Panton, she held his hand and told him tearfully, "After seven months, I have been asking the Lord to come back soon every day." Tears had washed her eyes so that she was able to see clearly.</P><P>If you study biology, you will find out that the eyes are like a pair of glasses. They need to be cleaned and washed often, or else they will not be transparent. Every time the eyelids are closed, tears flow out to wash the eyes. Similarly, in the spiritual world, the spiritual eyes of those who do not shed tears must not have been washed. Therefore, they cannot see clearly. It is no wonder that those who have never been wounded, afflicted, or have never encountered anything that was heart-breaking, distressful, or depressing to their spirit are ignorant and unclear about many things.</P><P>Once the parents of a child were quite good and quite zealous for the Lord. They did a great deal of good work for the Lord. But after a short time, the child whom they dearly loved died. They became very angry and said, "From now on we will not serve God any longer. Although we have served Him faithfully, He not only did not favor us with His grace, but He allowed our child to die." They were quite upset. From then on they became indifferent; they were no longer zealous and no longer pursued the Lord in a serious way. One day after eight or nine years, the father was walking in the wilderness. He saw a shepherd trying to lead a flock of sheep across a little creek. In the country side there are usually no sturdy bridges over the little creeks. In this case, a little wooden plank over the creek served as a bridge. It was adequate for people to walk across but very difficult to convince the sheep to walk across. Sheep are very timid and unsophisticated. No matter how much the shepherd goaded and coerced them, they would not cross it. Finally, out of desperation, the shepherd picked up a little lamb who was not weaned and precious to the mother sheep. He carried him across to the other side. The mother sheep, out of love for her little lamb, took the risk and followed the shepherd across. Soon after, all the lamb's brothers and sisters followed and crossed to the other side of the creek. The father, who was observing this, said, "It is enough!" From then on, he was revived. Later he testified, "Because God was afraid that I would be left on this side of the creek and would not go across, He took my child over first. Even the dumb sheep knew to follow the others across. Why then am I still tarrying here?"</P><P>Many times tears bring men closer to God. If a person has only passed through smooth and peaceful pathways and has never suffered the deprivation of wind, sleet, frost, and blizzard, he can never advance to become a deeper person. If he is willing to be a Christian only in peaceful times and unwilling to be one in days of tears, he is merely a mediocre person with little experience. Today many people will not believe because they have never suffered pain. Yes, if someone in the world fills his days with laughter, eating, and drinking, he can do just fine if no extraordinary events occur. However, anyone who cannot shed tears will not be able to see the light. No wonder they are still in their stupor, drunken with the worldly wine, and have not yet received salvation. Christians have also hardened their hearts and are unwilling to wipe their eyes with tears. No wonder they are so dull in spiritual matters.</P><P>Let us study the Bible and see what it says about tears and how we should deal with them. We do not need to rejoice or laugh. Rather, we need to mourn and weep because today is the time for weeping. This world is a place for weeping. Let me say again that people who put their tears aside are unenlightened. They do not know their place on earth. Oh, whoever cannot shed tears has lost their characteristic as a man. Indeed, the shedding of tears is the real meaning to human life. Let us see what the Lord would like us to be. In the entire Bible, there are only a few dozen references to tears. Today we do not need to read all of these verses; it is sufficient just to read several of them. What we are about to speak today can be summarized in several points: the meaning of tears, the relationship between tears and the repentance of sinners, and the relationship between tears and the prayer and work of the believers. At the end we will see what God does with our tears.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE MEANING OF TEARS</H2><P>At times, extreme joy can bring about tears. However, in general, tears result from excessive sorrow, when too much psychological pressure is applied to our being. In other words, when sorrow and depression within us become unbearable and the heart becomes overburdened and uncontrollable, tears flow out. Yet the amazing thing is that when our tears flow out, all the heavy burdens within suddenly become light. Originally everything was tense, but now things become relaxed. It seems that something has come out of us through the tears. Originally there were many things within; now there are fewer things within. Formerly it seemed as if we were inflated with air; now much of the air has been let out. Therefore, tears are very meaningful. They discharge whatever is in the heart. In other words, tears are the outlet of the heart. Now let us consider what the Bible has to say about this.</P><P>Job 16:20 says, "My friends scorn me:/but mine eye poureth out tears unto God." Job said this after he was stricken by Satan and ridiculed by his three friends. Brothers, have you experienced pouring out tears unto God while being ridiculed and oppressed by men? How many times have you been opposed by men? Have you ever suffered loss and borne a false charge? When you encountered these kinds of things, have you ever wept like Job did? Of course, weeping before men is a manifestation of your weakness, but a person ought to shed tears unto God. I have often said that whoever has shed tears before God is blessed. On the other hand, whoever has never shed tears before God does not know the meaning of fellowship. Neither does he know about being close to God or casting his burden on the Lord. A friend of mine once told me something regarding tears. He said, "When all your ways are blocked, when you are opposed in every place, when everyone says you are wrong, and when the environment vexes you, drop a few tears before God. This is your only way out. Only this will enable you to solve the problem." This statement is true. Whoever has passed through the same experience would say the same thing. These are unavoidable experiences, and every believer must pass through them. If you want to serve God faithfully and live in a godly way, things of this kind will surely happen to you, and tears will surely flow. There has never been a faithful one who has not shed tears. Brothers and sisters, how about you? If you have ever brought your problems or joys to God, I advise you to bring your tears to Him as well.</P><P>Psalm 6:6 says, "I cause my bed to swim all night long; / With my tears I dissolve my couch." At that time David was in the midst of adversity. Furthermore, his body was not strong. Therefore, he wept every night; his couch was wet, and his bed was made to swim. Let me say something that is not pleasing to the ears: whoever can only laugh but cannot weep, is a very shallow person. Whoever laughs all day long shows that within him he does not have much depth. Those who have never wept have never passed through God's digging hands. Tears indicate that a person has something within him. They show others that there is God's work within such a person. However, God does not treasure our tears that are shed in public, tears that others can see. He treasures the tears shed in secret, tears that are shed for Him. Proper and precious tears are tears "unto God," tears shed at night. We know that David was a person who knew how to cry very well. Psalms tells us that he wept many times. Whenever he sinned or encountered adversity, he would shed his tears before God. But Saul was not such a person. He could only become angry and vexed; he could not weep.</P><P>Tears are a sign of sadness. Sadness touches others' feeling, whereas laughter cannot touch others very deeply. Laughter is something on the surface, whereas grief comes from within. Since grief comes from a person's inner being, it must also enter into the inner being of others. All who have experience in human life acknowledge this. The shedding of tears is a sign of a broken heart. Therefore, before tears can flow from the eyes, they must first flow from the heart. It is meaningless to shed tears when the heart is not pained.</P><P>The reason David was led by God to such deep and full experiences was that he shed tears. The many tears that he shed reveal the many sufferings and adversities that he bore. Many lessons are learned from suffering. As Romans says, "Tribulation produces endurance" (5:3). Let us remember that David became David because of his tears. If there had been no tears to cultivate him, he could not have been any deeper than others were.</P><P>When the Israelites were carried away to a heathen land, the people ridiculed them, saying, "What do you have left? The temple of your God is ruined, and your nation has vanished. Where is your God? What has happened to you?" Under this kind of situation the sons of Korah wrote the psalm: "My tears have been my food/Day and night,/While they say to me all day long,/Where is your God?" (Psa. 42:3). At that time it was very painful for them. People were pricking them with sharp words that were hard to bear. They could not help but shed their tears unto God. Men like to prick those whom they hate. It is their joy to afflict them and cause them to suffer. In the same way, the enemy of the children of Israel came to prick them, scorn them, ridicule them, and cause them pain. At such a time, they could only shed tears. Even though that was the case, later on we shall see that God will take care of those tears.</P><P>Ecclesiastes 4:1 says, "So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter." Tears are shed when a person hears unpleasant words from others, when he encounters suffering and oppression that produce sorrow and anger, and when this sorrow and anger continue to press upon him until he can withstand them no more. As such times, the tears flow out.</P><P>Lamentations 1:2 says, "Bitterly she weeps in the night, / And her tears are on her cheeks./There is no one to comfort her/Among all her lovers;/All her friends have dealt treacherously with her;/They have become her enemies." Lamentations was written by Jeremiah. It speaks of the situation after the children of Israel were carried away into captivity. This verse shows us that the children of Israel wept because they were dealt with treacherously.</P><P>From all the foregoing verses, we can see that tears are shed through others' oppression, treachery, ridicule, and other adverse situations. Therefore, the shedding of tears is an indication of pressure and pain. All these things must have happened to our Lord. Otherwise, why did He weep and shed tears? His shedding of tears tells us that He also suffered all these things. The shedding of tears is not something negative; rather, it is holy.</P><P>In this world a tearful face is better than a smiling face. It is fortunate that a few tears are shed to wash this adulterous and sinful world! If there were no tears, I am afraid that the world would be even more evil. It is fortunate that in this blind and crooked generation there are a few streams of warm tears; they tell us that men still have some feelings. If there were no such tears, I fear that the world would become like a deep pit; its darkness would be worse than hell. Today on this earth there are still many beautiful flowers. If there were no tears to cultivate them, they would all have withered. If it were not for the tears that maintain relationships between parents, husbands and wives, brothers, relatives, and friends, the world would immediately resemble the situation in the great tribulation. We know that Antichrist is coming. Fortunately, there are tears to hold him back. Otherwise, the pain would be even more severe, and sin would be even more rampant. Therefore, tears are the real meaning of human life. They show that a person still bears his human nature and still has the sense of sin. Wherever sin is, tears must also be present. Heart-breaking experiences, sorrowful events, and recollections of the past can all cause us to shed tears. The reason many people cannot shed tears is that they have forgotten their past history, they have left paradise and do not know where they are today. The same applies to man's experience of God's redemption; without the shedding of tears, man cannot return to the beginning. Anyone who has forgotten what he has passed through cannot shed tears. The shedding of tears is an indication that a person feels pain concerning his past.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE FUNCTION OF TEARS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Concerning Salvation</H2><P>Tears are not something that a person can control. If you can shed tears whenever you want to, those tears lose their meaning and value. Any tears that are not shed because of anguish in the heart are meaningless and fabricated. Although tears are involuntary, everyone has tears and sheds tears. If you say that you have never shed any tears, you must be a heartless person and cannot possibly be a Christian.</P><P>Let me now say a few words to the unbelieving friends. Do you know that tears can bring a person to the Lord Jesus and draw a person closer to the God in heaven? Tears remove the obstacles and replace sin with repentance. Friends! Do you know sin? Do you know the significance of sin? Have you ever repented of your sins to the point that you shed your tears? If you have never felt sorrowful for your sins, I wonder whether or not you have a heart. If a person has never shed tears for his sins, he has a heart of stone; he does not have any emotions or feelings. The way your heart feels about sin is expressed in your eyes. Oh, sin is real! I do not need to mention your sins before God. I only need to mention some of your sins before men and it will become obvious to you. Please consider how much you have offended others. You have owed, cheated, and taken advantage of those whom you know, such as your parents, wife, brothers, relatives, friends, classmates, and colleagues. You may have things that are not clearly dealt with and accounts that are not clearly settled yet. All these are sins. If you do not deal with them, you cannot draw near to God. This is a most serious matter. Do you know how serious sin is? You have sinned and even now are filled with sin. These many sins will bring you to the abyss. Friends! Repent! Turn! Wash yourselves with your tears! Only the blood can wash you. But that is only the first thing that washes you. There is still the second thing, which is your tears. In other words, sin is washed away before God by the blood, but it is washed away in your heart by tears. One thing is sure: before God, tears can never wash one's sins away; only the Lord's blood can wash one's sins away. But the blood calls for tears also. One has to add the tears to the blood. Even if there is the Lord's redemption, without man's repentance and hatred for sin, there is no washing. Therefore, if you want to have the subjective experience, tears are indispensable. Consider what the men of ancient times did.</P><P>Lamentations 2:18 says, "Their heart cried to the Lord:/ O wall of the daughter of Zion,/Let tears run down like a strea/Day and night;/Give yourself no respite;/Let not the pupil of your eye cease." Why did the Israelites weep so much? They wept in repentance for their sins, for the captivity of Zion, the occupation of Jerusalem, and the carrying away of the Israelites to the east of the river Euphrates. At such hopeless times, they wept for their sins and for the destruction of their nation and temple. I deeply hope that more tears will come from you, and that they will flow out as a river day and night.</P><P>Unbelieving friends, I wish that you would weep! All those who smile at sin do not know sin. Neither do they know their destiny. All those who have never shed tears do not know the love of God and the preciousness of Christ. All those who never weep for their sins do not know the joy of forsaking sins. Tears for our sins are something indispensable. Have you offended anyone? Have you stolen from others? Do you have pride, jealousy, or anger? Indeed, you have sinned against God in many areas, and you have also sinned against man. The only thing that will solve the problems is tears. However, if a person only sheds tears outwardly without feeling remorse in his heart, it is useless. Therefore, tears are not merely something outward. The source of tears is the heart. Only that which issues from the heart and feeling can touch others.</P><P>The New Testament makes it more clear that tears are for the repentance of sins. Please read Luke 7:38: "And she stood behind Him at His feet weeping and began to wet His feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head, and she kissed His feet affectionately and anointed them with the ointment." Then verse 44 says, "But she, with her tears, has wet My feet and with her hair has wiped them." Friends, have you seen tears of this kind? There are many kinds of tears in this world. Some are shed over disappointment; others are shed over anxiety. Some are shed as a result of extreme joy (though rare); others are shed because the environment is too harsh and painful. Sometimes they come from extreme hatred, at other times from anger or arguments. There are all kinds of reasons for tears. But have you seen the kind of tears that this woman had, tears that were shed as a result of extreme sorrow for her own sin?</P><P>The Lord's blood cleanses all of man's sins. But if tears are not added to the blood, it will not be effective in man. Once Alexander received a letter from another person accusing his mother of all her sins, listing the numerous sinful things that his mother had done. The intention of the letter was to condemn Alexander's mother. But in Alexander's reply, there was only one sentence, "My mother's tears have washed away all her sins," and the matter was put to rest.</P><P>No matter how many tears you shed, nothing can wash away your sins before God. But there is another aspect that is just as real. Although Jesus Christ has died, the effectiveness of the blood will not be realized in us unless there are tears. No one can receive the Lord and be saved if he has never repented and shed tears for his sins. This can never happen. Every true believer of the Lord has had the experience of repentance. I have a friend who once said that there are two medicines to deal with sin. One is the blood of the Lord, and the other is our own tears. This may sound strange, but it is true. Indeed, no one who puts his trust in the blood is without tears. This is what the types in the Old Testament tell us also. Those who did not remove the leaven were not able to keep the feast of Passover. Those who did not eat the unleavened bread could not partake of the lamb. As much as the blood is a most important thing, there is the need for warm tears of repentance also. Otherwise, the matter is not over. We must have the Lord's blood in our hands, and we must add onto that a few teardrops. The tears have to be mingled with the blood. If a man has never felt sorry for his past sins, he can never be saved.</P><P>We are not speaking about the function of tears with respect to our salvation today. Therefore, we will not elaborate on this. Now we want to consider what tears mean to our brothers and sisters, those who are saved among us. In the story of the woman, she wiped the Lord's feet with her tears. When we come to the Lord, although we may not have very much money to buy ointment to anoint His head and His feet, we can offer to Him our tears. Thank the Lord! The ointment is good, but the tears are better. It is better to come to the Lord with tears than to come to Him without tears. Let us all bring the tears in our eyes to Him! Now let us consider what the Bible teaches about the ways believers should use their tears.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Concerning Prayer</H2><P>Psalm 39:12 says, "Hear my prayer, O Jehovah;/And hearken to my cry;/Do not hold Your peace at my tears./ For I am a stranger with You,/A sojourner, as all my fathers were." The best way to receive God's answer to our prayer is to pray with tears before Him. If our prayers are seasoned with tears, they will be answered much sooner. Many prayers are heartless prayers because there are no tears in them. A person can only have tears when his heart is there. We can tell the Lord that we are not here for long, that we are only sojourners and strangers, and that we have suffered long enough on this earth. Based on this, we can ask Him to hear our prayers. God will answer our prayers this way. Although the tears themselves score no merit, they nevertheless show what is in our heart; they show that we have an earnest heart. May we have more tears in our prayers, so that God would answer us.</P><P>Second Kings 20:5-6 says, "Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold,...I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake." How wonderful it is that God sees our tears. Hezekiah prayed for his longevity with tears, and God answered. This means that God is pleased with our tearful prayers. Our tearful prayers can move God's heart. Anything that does not move our heart to tears will surely not move God's heart. It does not hurt if we shed more tears before God. Shedding tears before man is a sign of weakness and speaks of our lack of manliness. But being unable to shed tears before God is an indication that we have become just a piece of stone and wood, and that we are insensitive. I treasure very much the words of 2 Kings 20:5: "I have seen thy tears." Every time we encounter difficulties, sufferings, and pressure, and every time we come to the end of ourselves, we can lift up our heads and shed our tears before Him. God sees our tears. However, if the tears are not before Him, they are useless. There are many people who weep in this world. Men's tears only show their own sorrows and sufferings; they do not affect anything. Tears must be accompanied by prayers. Every time we weep, suffer, and feel sorrowful, we should also pray. We can tell God our sufferings and sorrows through our prayer. The Bible not only shows us that Hezekiah prayed this way, but our Lord also petitioned and supplicated with strong crying and tears (Heb. 5:7).</P><P>Many times it is useless for two persons to cry to each other. But it is useful to cry to God, because God sees our tears and will answer our prayers. Indeed, God counts every drop of our tears. Psalm 56:8 says, "You have counted my wanderings./Put my tears into Your bottle./Are they not in Your book?" Please remember the benefit of shedding tears before God. Sorrowful men! If we are embittered by human life and are pressed beyond measure, if we have lost our taste for life, if we are weary of struggling and cannot get through with all of our problems, simply go to God and cry. Be assured that it will not be in vain. God records every tear that we shed and puts them in a bottle. This means that God preserves all our experiences of sufferings like keeping tears in a bottle. Thank the Lord that our tears have not fallen to the ground and been lost in the dust; they are preserved in God's bottle. "Are they not in Your book?" This shows that God does not forget. He preserves and remembers.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, do you know what kind of crying is most enjoyable and refreshing? When does a child cry most loudly and vigorously? It is not when he is chastised, nor when he is hungry, but when he is bullied by others outside the house and has suffered injustice or frustration. When he returns home and cries to his dear mother, the crying is very unrestricted; he can surely have a good cry before her. The crying that is done before one's loved one is the most releasing kind of crying. It is not very meaningful to cry before other men, and the tears do not count for much. Where then should we go to cry and when should we cry? We cry before God, the One who loves us and cares for us the most. With God we can cry until our heart is fully relieved because He cares for us. Our crying to God is most enjoyable because God listens carefully to us. Another reason that we can cry unreservedly is that He will do according to what we ask of Him. Indeed, if we will do this before God, we will see some most wonderful results.</P><P>Let us read the story of a father and his son, and we will understand immediately the profit of praying with tears before God. Mark 9:24 says, "Immediately, crying out, the father of the child said, I believe; help my unbelief!" At that time, it was too painful for him. He hated the fact that he could not believe, or that his faith was not enough. On one hand, he saw his child in pain and could not make him better in spite of all that he had done. On the other hand, he sought for the help of the Lord's disciples, and they were unable to do anything. He was indeed frustrated. Under such anxiety and pain, he could not contain himself; he had to cry and call on the Lord. What was the result? The Lord heard his prayer, and the child was healed. There is a reason for many prayers not being answered. It is because there are no tears.</P><P>Second Timothy 1:3-4 says, "Unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my petitions night and day, longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy." Why did Paul want to see Timothy? It was because of Timothy's tears. All the workers of the Lord in the Bible are men of tears. We believe that no proper worker of the Lord can be without tears. It seems that tears are the one necessary thing that a worker must have. All proper prayers should be with tears. This will cause God to remember us and answer us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Concerning the Lord's Work</H2><P>Now let us consider the relationship of tears to the Lord's work and their place in His work.</P><P>Jeremiah 9:1 says, "Oh, that my head were waters,/And my eye a fountain of tears,/That I might weep day and night /For the slain of the daughter of my people!" Jeremiah could really weep. Everyone calls him a weeping prophet. Read verse 18: "Let them hasten and take up a wailing for us,/That our eyes may shed tears/And our eyelids may pour forth water." Verse 17 of chapter thirteen says, "And if you will not hear it,/My soul will weep in secret places for your pride;/And my eye will weep bitterly and shed tears,/ Because the flock of Jehovah has been taken captive." If men did not listen to the word of the Lord, Jeremiah would weep. Verse 17 of chapter fourteen says, "And you shall speak this word to them,/Let my eyes run down with tears/Night and day, and let them not cease;/For the virgin daughter of my people is broken with great brokenness,/A very grievous wound." He cried because the Israelites suffered a blow. No proper worker of the Lord can be without tears. All those who do not weep for their work have no heart for their work. All those who have a heart for their work cannot help weeping. Many times when we try to deal with someone and exhaust all means, there is no result. Yet there is still one thing we can do: we can weep. Sometimes when no persuasion works, tears become the last persuasion. Sometimes in warfare we exhaust all weapons, and there is still no victory. Tears can be the last weapon. Men may resist other weapons, but they have to surrender before the tears.</P><P>There is no lover of the Lord who does not cry. We should ache for sinners to the point of weeping for them. We should weep because God's glory is challenged, and we should weep in anguish that the enemy is not yet bound. Those who have no desire to please the Lord do not have this kind of experience. All those whose hearts are in the Lord's work surely weep. Jeremiah was a prophet who was greatly used by the Lord. He was such because of his tears. He was anxious and felt responsible for God's children, and he wept for them day and night. Tears are indispensable. This world needs more tears to wash it. Many young believers need tears to nurture them and educate them. Our spiritual life is maintained by tears. Many sinners are waiting for our sowing work with tears. Without tears, none of these works can be carried out. Today, men's consecrations are too inadequate. Many have consecrated their bodies, their energy, their time, and their money, but they have not consecrated their tears. No wonder many works are not complete and many believers are not properly edified.</P><P>If we weep for the work, what will be the result? I can assure you that tears cannot flow on forever; there will surely be a time when they will stop. Read Jeremiah 31:16: "Thus says Jehovah,/Hold back your voice from weeping,/And your eyes from tears;/For there is a reward for your work, declares Jehovah;/And they will return from the land of the enemy." If we truly weep for the work, God will reward us.</P><P>Tears are necessary not only in God's work but in our family life also. We can see this from the way a mother deals with her son. We have never seen a good mother who is anxious for her son but never weeps for him. This is true even among Christians. The tears that a mother sheds for her son are most effective. The return of prodigal sons is many times due to the tears of their mothers. No matter how fallen a son is, and how far he has strayed away from home, as long as he has a good mother who cries for him at home, sooner or later the prodigal son will be brought back by his mother's tears. It is useless to watch one's son turning wayward, and to fret, shout, and even beat him, without weeping. If a mother has all the virtues but lacks tears, she cannot be considered a good mother. The same is true in dealing with sinners and young believers. It is good and profitable that you visit them, help them, and read the Bible to them. But one thing is indispensable. You have to have the prayer of Jeremiah, who said, "Oh, that my head were waters, / And my eye a fountain of tears" (Jer. 9:1). Otherwise, your work will not be complete. Many workers of the Lord ask God for eloquence, power, knowledge, and opportunities. All of these are good. But one thing is indispensable in the Lord's work, which is to have our eyes "shed tears" (v. 18).</P><P>Not only are there examples in the Old Testament, but there are examples in the New Testament as well. Read Acts 20:19: "Serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears." Verse 31 says, "Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears." How did Paul serve the Lord? He served in all humility and by shedding tears night and day. Tears are a good way to work. I say again, no one can be complete without tears. A person may be good at many things, but if he does not weep, he cannot be considered as complete. In serving the Lord, we must have tears, both before the Lord and before men. Of course, such tears cannot be fabricated. They must flow spontaneously out of our deep feelings.</P><P>Paul said that for three years he was in tears for them night and day. Have you shed tears this way for your work? All we have to ask a person is whether or not he has shed tears to find out whether or not he is zealous, if he is single for his work, and if his heart of service is complete. I must say honestly that without tears no work can become prosperous. If we do not do this one thing in secret, the progress of our work will be hindered.</P><P>Second Corinthians 2:4 says, "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that you would be made sorrowful but that you would know the love which I have more abundantly toward you." We know that Paul wrote the first Epistle to the Corinthians when he heard from the household of Chloe about the condition of the Corinthian believers. Paul pointed out all their mistakes and rebuked them with the most severe and frank word. Now in the second Epistle he told them how he wrote the first Epistle. He said that he did it out of much affliction and anguish of heart and through many tears.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, when you hear of a brother or a sister backsliding, would you weep like Paul did? Weeping is not easy. Both laughing and weeping require strength. Brothers, do you have the strength to weep? You saw how severe Paul's words to the Corinthians were; they were like sharp knives. He said in one place that they should drive out the sinner or else he would do something. Such words are indeed hard to take. One thing is sure: if you want your words to pierce others, they must first pierce you. If they have never pierced you, they can never pierce others. Paul was indeed such a person. While he was writing the strongest words in the first Epistle, he was doing it in tears. Before he spoke, and before others felt the pain, he felt the pain. Therefore, if you want others to feel the pain, you must first feel the pain. It will never work if you only want others to be sorrowful. For this reason, every worker of the Lord must be experienced in the matter of tears. In other words, all those who do not shed tears when they see their brothers falling and failing are not worthy to do the Lord's work, and they are not qualified to rebuke or exhort others. If you want to rebuke a brother, or if you want to tell him about something that he has done wrong, you must first feel the pain and the sharpness of the words before you are qualified to rebuke. It is easy to point out others' shortcomings, but it is difficult to say it with tears. However, only those who have tears are qualified to speak.</P><P>Thank the Lord that the blood of His Son was shed on earth and was not retracted. Man can receive salvation through this blood. Thank the Lord that the tears of His Son were also not retracted. They tell us that He is mindful of us, and they also induce us to shed tears before God and before men. May we imitate our Lord in our prayers and in our work, and may we shed more tears!</P><P>Psalm 126:5-6 says, "They that sow in tears/shall reap in joy./He that goeth forth and weepeth,/bearing precious seed,/shall doubtless come again with rejoicing,/bringing his sheaves with him." Do you want to testify for the Lord? This verse tells you how to do it. The seed is the gospel, and the sheaves are the salvation of men. If you sow the seed, you have to water it with tears before it will grow. Without water, seeds will not grow. Do not think that it is easy to bear fruit; you cannot succeed unless there are tears. Here it says that if you shed tears before God in secret, you will bring in the sheaves with joy. Many times you consider the preaching of the gospel as something common. No wonder there is no sprouting and harvesting. Tears are most crucial to your work. Any work that lacks tears is doomed to fail. Tears speak of your heart. Where your tears are, there your heart is also. This is a fact. It is dangerous to work without your heart being put into it. May we be zealous for God's work, and may we have definite tears.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. WHAT GOD DOES WITH OUR TEARS</H2><P>Now let us consider what God does with our tears. Psalm 56:8 says, "You have counted my wanderings./Put my tears into Your bottle./Are they not in Your book?" From this we see that God remembers and counts our tears. God has not forgotten one drop of our tears.</P><P>Psalm 80:5 says, "You have fed them with the bread of tears/And have made them drink tears in large measure." Psalm 116:8 says, "For thou hast delivered my soul from death,/mine eyes from tears,/and my feet from falling." These two verses show us that God seems to give us tears as our food and drink, that we should eat and drink of them. Oh, we should live our days on earth in tears, and we should have tears as our companions. This world is a place of tears. Almost every patch of earth has been soaked with tears; hardly one place is dry. Here everything gives us heartaches, and every circumstance causes pain to our hearts. There is no peace on this earth. In spite of this, He will deliver our eyes from tears, and our feet from falling. That day will come. We will not be in this tearful world forever.</P><P>Revelation 7:17 says, "God will wipe away every tear from their eyes." The group mentioned here is the church. God will wipe away every tear from the eyes of all the believers on earth. This is the Lord's promise during the great tribulation and before the millennium.</P><P>After the millennium, the Lord promises another group of people, saying, "And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore; for the former things have passed away" (Rev. 21:4). This group of people are those who will be the citizens in the millennium. This means that all the saved ones, whether they are the church, the Jews, or the Gentiles, will have the Lord's promise: "God will wipe away every tear."</P><P>I love the New Jerusalem, not for its street of gold and gates of pearl, but for the Lord's presence. There will be no tears there. When we die, we are not going into sorrow, but resting. When a person is tired from walking, he goes away to sleep for a while. Everyone is waiting for that day to come. We are not waiting to die. Some have rested today. If the Lord delays His coming, some will rest for thirty years or fifty years. Some, like Paul, will have to rest for two thousand years before that day will come. Thank the Lord, we can cease from our tears when that day comes and the world passes away.</P><P>The Lord bore our sufferings so that we would not have to suffer anymore. Thank the Lord that there will be no more sorrow and no more sin there. Trouble, suffering, and tears come from sin. Because there will be no more sin there, there will be no more tears forever. Thank God that the days of sorrow and the things of sorrow will not last. The New Jerusalem is coming soon, and the tearful world will soon pass away. When we arrive there, all the sufferings will be gone because when sin is removed, sufferings will be removed also.</P><P>In that day the Lord will give us a resurrected body. One brother in the Lord said that to him that body will be the same as the body we have today, that is, all the members will be there, and everything will be the same except that they will all be transformed. However, in the transformed body, one thing will be missing-tears in the eyes. Tears belong to the night, and there will be no need of them any longer.</P><P>Thank God that we are blessed, for the earthen vessel will not be working and praying here all the time. But while we are still here on earth, we are satisfied in God. Yet this will not be long either. Oh, that day will come. I hope that day will come quickly.</P><P>Finally, I will close my message with a story. At the end of the European War, casualties were great on both the French and the German sides. Many were seriously wounded on the battlefield and were dying. Among them one wounded French soldier who was a Christian held up a bottle of water to a German soldier who also was a Christian. At that time, both were dying. After they drank the water, the French soldier held the hand of the German soldier and said, "In that place, there will be no war." At that word, both turned over and died. Oh! Let us also say here today, "In that place, there will be no more tears."</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RAPTURE AND THE TRIBULATION</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 43</H2><P>Tonight I will bring up a subject which is very important. This subject is the rapture. Rapture is a special term; it refers to our being taken up to the heavens at the time of the Lord's coming again. We all know that the Lord will come again soon. The Bible tells us that before He comes down to the earth, He will bring us to the heavens, after which He will come down. His bringing us to the heavens is called the rapture.</P><P>Concerning the rapture, there are several opinions among Christians. Let me bring a few points to your attention. What is before us, and what we are looking forward to, is the rapture. However, a terrible tribulation is also before us. This tribulation can be called the trial, or the last three and a half years. According to the Bible, this tribulation is very great. "For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur" (Matt. 24:21). Both the rapture and the tribulation are before us. If we are not raptured, we will surely go through the tribulation; if we do not go through the tribulation, we will surely be raptured. Among Christians there are several different views concerning the matter of rapture.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE DIFFERENT VIEWS</H2><P>Some Christians say that all the saved ones who are genuinely regenerated and have new life will be raptured before the tribulation. This means that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</P><P>Other Christians say that the whole church will go through the tribulation and then be raptured. This means that all saved ones who are genuinely regenerated and have new life will go through the trial before they will be raptured.</P><P>Some other Christians say that among all the saved ones, a minority will be raptured before the tribulation and the majority will go through the tribulation before they are raptured. They say that not every regenerated person will be raptured before the tribulation, but only the regenerated ones who have been watching, preparing, and waiting for the Lord's coming back day after day will be raptured before the tribulation. The regenerated ones who do not watch, prepare, and wait for the Lord's coming will not be raptured before the tribulation. In other words, the whole church will not be raptured before the tribulation; only a minority will be raptured before the tribulation. Neither does this mean that the whole church will have to go through the tribulation before it can be raptured. It means that the majority will go through the tribulation. Those who hold this view make a compromise between the first and second view.</P><P>In brief, the first group says that the whole church (all the regenerated ones) will be raptured before the tribulation. The second group says that the whole church (all the regenerated ones) will be raptured after the tribulation. The third group says that the minority who are watching, preparing, and waiting for Lord's coming will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas the rest (also regenerated ones) will go through the tribulation and then be raptured.</P><P>We must be careful! Regarding the rapture, although there are three different views, our attitude must be fair and proper, because among these three groups there are persons who are very good in Bible knowledge and are very spiritual. They all have their arguments. For example, among those who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation are J. N. Darby, William Kelly, R. A. Torrey, D. L. Moody, J. H. Brookes, J. M. Gray, A. C. Gaebelein, J. A. Seiss, C. I. Scofield, and others.</P><P>Among those who believe that the whole church will go through the tribulation and then be raptured are George Muller, A. J. Gordon, A. B. Simpson, Dr. Erdman, Professor Moorhead, H. W. Frost, Robert Cameron, James Wright, B. W. Newton, and others.</P><P>Among those who believe that a minority will be raptured before the tribulation and the majority will go through the tribulation before being raptured are: Hudson Taylor, R. C. Chapman, R. Govett, G. H. Pember, D. M. Panton, Paul Rader, and others.</P><P>Because every one of these is a reliable scholar and a spiritual person, it becomes impossible to follow man in this matter. If you want to follow man, whom should you follow? They all are outstanding children of God! This kind of situation only causes us to acknowledge that even the best persons can make mistakes. We need to come solely to the Lord and beseech Him for light.</P><P>Because there are very reliable scholars and spiritual persons on each side, when opinions differ, no one should revile others, and no one should say anything that is unbecoming of a Christian, such as, "Such a teaching is from Satan," or "Such a thought is from Satan," and so forth. We must realize that these are our brothers, and their life in Christ is probably deeper than ours. We should by no means consider them as "false prophets," or consider that they are "ignorant of the principles of prophecy," or that their views are "absurd" or are "cunning teachings." If we say these things, we will not only offend the brothers, but we will offend the Lord. We should only present the reasons and make a clear judgment according to the Bible.</P><P>It is impossible that all three of these views are correct. Either all three are wrong, or only one is correct and the other two are wrong. If we want to know who is correct and who is wrong, we must judge everything according to the Bible. Only the Bible has the authority to judge. We should find out the proofs from the Bible, and we should see whose reasons are most convincing and whose reasons are not trustworthy.</P><P>However, we have to be very careful about one thing. We cannot just quote verses every time we look for proof from the Bible. We should not presume that as long as a person has some verses, he has the proof. We must be careful that the verses we quote do indeed prove the things we are discussing. If we only quote verses, without asking whether or not the verses are appropriate to the subject matter, it would be like an incapable lawyer who quotes many irrelevant laws to defend his client. Is this not an unacceptable practice in the law? Now we will begin by considering the view of the first group.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE REASONS AND PRESUMPTIONS FOR BELIEVING<br>THE WHOLE CHURCH IS TO BE RAPTURED<br>BEFORE THE TRIBULATION</H2><P>Approximately one year after I was saved, I read many books written by those who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation; as a result, I thought that the whole church would be raptured before the tribulation. However, I did not tell anybody about it. Later, when I read 1 Corinthians 15 and 1 Thessalonians 4 carefully, I felt that it did not quite make sense for the whole church to be raptured before the tribulation. It is true that both passages talk about the rapture, but where in these two passages does it say that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation? What gives us the authority to say that 1 Corinthians 15 and 1 Thessalonians 4 tell us that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation? As I asked myself this question, I was troubled. Since then, I have searched the Bible very carefully. After many years of study, my research shows that those who teach that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation are making two big mistakes. First, the Scriptures they quote do not actually prove that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation. Second, they rely upon too many presumptions which they use as facts. I will first talk about the unreliability of their reasons, and then I will point out their many presumptions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Unreliability of the Reasons</H2><P>According to my knowledge, those who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation have seven reasons which they consider as substantial and very reliable. I believe I have not missed any, and even if I have, they would be minor points. The seven reasons they hold are very unconvincing. We will consider them one by one and see how they are unreliable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The First Reason</H2><P>Romans 5:9 says, "Much more then, having now been justified in His blood, we will be saved through Him from the wrath." First Thessalonians 1:9-10 says, "For they themselves report concerning us what kind of entrance we had toward you and how you turned to God from the idols to serve a living and true God and await His Son from the heavens, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming."</P><P>They say that these passages tell us that we shall be saved from the wrath through Jesus' blood, and that the Lord will deliver us from the wrath which is coming. What is the coming wrath? Does it not refer to the great tribulation? Therefore, being delivered from the coming wrath is being delivered from the coming tribulation. We must be raptured to be delivered from the coming tribulation; if we are not raptured, we must go through the tribulation. Therefore, they believe that the rapture must take place before the tribulation.</P><P>First Thessalonians 5:9-11 says, "For God did not appoint us to wrath but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us in order that whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with Him. Therefore comfort one another, and build up each one the other, even as you also do."</P><P>They say that the great tribulation is God's great wrath. Since God did not appoint us to wrath, we will not go through the tribulation. If we go through the tribulation, this means that we will receive the great wrath. But since God did not appoint us to wrath, we all must be raptured before the tribulation.</P><P>Based upon the Scriptures we have quoted, are these reasons sufficient? Is there any evidence that the words of 1 Thessalonians 5:9-11 refer to the great tribulation? If this question cannot be answered first, how can they use these three passages as evidence that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation?</P><P>Even if we concede that "the wrath" refers to the great tribulation, we still cannot base our reasoning upon these passages and say that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation. Yes, the great tribulation is a wrath from God. It is true that these three passages say that we will not suffer God's wrath. But these three passages do not say that we will not suffer Satan's wrath and will not be afflicted by Satan, because in the great tribulation there will be wrath and afflictions from Satan as well! God punishes the unbelievers, while Satan afflicts the believers. If we search the book of Revelation, we will see that what Christians suffer from is the wrath and affliction from Satan. During the great tribulation, not only is there wrath from God, but there is also wrath and affliction from Satan. Therefore, according to the Bible, the three passages that are quoted cannot be counted as valid reasons.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Second Reason</H2><P>Jeremiah 30:6-7 says, "Ask now and see/Whether a man can give birth./Why do I see every man/With his hands on his loins like a woman about to give birth/And every face turned pale?/Alas! For that day is great,/And there is none like it;/And it is a time of distress for Jacob,/But he will be saved out of it."</P><P>Daniel 12:1 says, "And at that time Michael, the great prince who stands for the children of your people, will arise; and there will be a time of distress, such as never occurred since there came to be a nation until that time; and at that time your people, every one found written in the book, will be delivered."</P><P>These ones point out that Jeremiah said, "It is a time of distress for Jacob," and Daniel said, "Your people...will be delivered." From this, they contend that the great tribulation is coming to the Jews only and not to the church, because the church is not the house of Jacob or the people of Israel.</P><P>If we consider only what Jeremiah and Daniel said, then the great tribulation is indeed limited to the Jews. But we should remember what the Lord said. He not only said, "It is written," but also said, "Again, it is written" (Matt. 4:4, 7). It is not sufficient to see only one aspect of the Scriptures; we need to see other Scriptures. "Again, it is written"; this is a very important principle. According to other Scriptures, the great tribulation is not only for the Jews, because Revelation 3:10 says clearly, "I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth." Everyone agrees that this refers to the great tribulation. It is the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, and not only to the Jews. Therefore, we may say that, on one hand, the great tribulation is the time of Jacob's trouble, but on the other hand, it is also the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole inhabited earth. They cannot quote just these two verses as evidence. Logically, this argument cannot stand.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Third Reason</H2><P>Revelation 4:1 says, "After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here."</P><P>Revelation 4:4 says, "And around the throne there were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and upon their heads golden crowns."</P><P>These ones say that Revelation 2 and 3 refer to the age of the church, and that in Revelation 4:1, "Come up here," refers to the whole church's being raptured. John represented the church. Therefore, when a voice said to John, "Come up here," it meant that the whole church would be raptured. The twenty-four elders also represent the whole church, and therefore, the twenty-four elders sitting on the twenty-four thrones refer to the whole church in heaven, that is, the glorified church. The great tribulation in Revelation begins in chapter six. But in chapter four, the whole church is in the heavens. This means that the church will not go through the great tribulation but will be raptured before the tribulation.</P><P>However, Revelation 4:1 is not spoken to the seven churches in chapters two and three; it is spoken to John individually. This matter is in the past, not in the future. It was the Lord's personal word to John when he was on the island of Patmos. John was caught up from the island of Patmos because the Lord wanted to show him what must take place after those things. The book of Revelation is the record of what John saw. If this verse can be quoted as evidence that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation, then "the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away" (Acts 8:39) can also be quoted as evidence that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation. We know that although the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, he was later found at Azotus; we all know that this cannot be counted as an evidence.</P><P>Saying that the twenty-four elders represent the whole church is totally unreliable. According to the Bible, the twenty-four elders cannot be counted as the representatives of the whole church. This is because:</P><P>(1) The number twenty-four is not the number of the church. The Bible never uses the number twenty-four to represent the church. The number that represents the church is either seven or a multiple of seven.</P><P>(2) The Bible never uses the elders to represent the church. It is true that there were elders among the Jews in the Old Testament, and there are elders in the New Testament. But the church is not an elder. According to historical facts, God first chose the angels, then the Jews, and finally the church. Not only can the church not be the elders, even the Jews cannot be the elders. The elders in this verse have something to do with the heavens, the earth, and the seas; they have nothing to do with human beings. Even though there are elderly ones in the church, can we say the whole church is composed of elders? Even though there is the eldership in the church, can we say that the whole church constitutes an eldership?</P><P>(3) Revelation 4:2 says, "There was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne there was One sitting." The "One" is God. Then 5:6 says, "In the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing." Who is the Lamb? We know that it is Christ. Revelation 4:4 says, "And around the throne there were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones twenty-four elders sitting...and upon their heads golden crowns." These three verses tell us that God is sitting on the throne in the center; Christ is standing in the midst of the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders; and twenty-four elders are sitting on twenty-four thrones which are around the throne. If the twenty-four elders represent the whole church sitting in the heavens, can God sit on the throne and the church also sit on a throne with a golden crown on her head, and Christ not sit on a throne and not have a golden crown on His head? It is not until chapter nineteen that Christ has the crown on His head, and it is not until chapter twenty that Christ sits on the throne. Can the church sit on a throne with a crown on her head before Christ does? What does sitting on the throne and wearing a crown indicate? It indicates authority; it indicates reigning. Is it possible that the church can have authority and reign before Christ? We know that this is impossible. So the twenty-four elders must not represent the church.</P><P>(4) The Bible does not say that the elders' white garments have been washed in the precious blood. In other places, when a white robe is mentioned, it says that the robe has been washed in the blood of the Lamb (Rev. 7:14). When the Bible mentions white garments, does it not refer to the righteousness of Christ? Since the elders' white garments have never been washed in the blood of the Lamb, does this mean that they have no sin? Since the church has been washed in the blood of the Lamb, how can the elders who are not washed in the blood of the Lamb represent the church?</P><P>(5) The song that the elders sing is not the song of redemption. Revelation 4:11 says, "You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, for You have created all things, and because of Your will they were, and were created." The song that the elders sing is concerning God's creation; it is not the song of their redemption. Revelation 5:8-10 says, "The four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb...And they sing a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, for You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made them a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth." Although this is the song of redemption, they praise the Lord for redeeming others, not for their redemption. Both the old Chinese translation and the English King James Version are wrong in translating "men" into "us." If the "men" is translated into "us," then how can the following word "them" make sense? [The Chinese version translates "them" in verse 10; but the English King James Version translates "us."] Among all of the reliable scholars who have studied the manuscripts, none consider it reliable to translate "men" into "us." But those who believe the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation hold onto such an unreliable translation tenaciously. How can this be a valid reason? Can we say the twenty-four elders are the church, even though the song they sing is for the redemption of others? Does this make sense?</P><P>(6) The elders are the elders in the universe. Revelation 4:4 says, "And upon the thrones twenty-four elders sitting." Revelation 4:7 says, "And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle." The things mentioned here are not the church, the Jews, the Gentiles, or the earth; the sphere here is the whole universe. Can the church be considered as the elders of the universe? If not, then the twenty-four elders here surely are not the church; they are the elders of the universe.</P><P>(7) Revelation 5:8 says, "And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which bowls are the prayers of the saints." It is interesting to see that in this verse the prayers of the saints were brought to God by the elders. The church can pray, and the church can pray for others, but the church cannot bring the prayers of others to God. This is not what the church does; the church has never done this. It is obvious that the elders are not the raptured church.</P><P>(8) In 7:13-14, it is interesting to note that there are three kinds of people: the elders, John, and those who came out of the great tribulation. The elder asked John who they were and where they had come from. John answered, "My lord, you know." If we say that the twenty-four elders represent the church, and John also typifies the raptured church, then we face a tough problem, because the elders asked John, and John asked the elders. This would mean that the representative is asking the representative, the type is asking the type. This would make the church asking the church who they were, and the church asking the church where they came from.</P><P>(9) In Revelation 7:14, John called one of the elders "my lord," but the elder did not correct John by telling him not to call him lord. It is obvious that John's position is lower than that of the elder. John confessed that the elders' position was higher. If the elders are the church, then John is an elder too. If John is also an elder, he would only need to call the elder "brother." Why did John call him "my lord"? We conclude that the elders are not the raptured church.</P><P>(10) The number twenty-four should be interpreted literally: it is not a sign. In the book of Revelation, John said that one of the twenty-four elders was speaking to him a few times. It is obvious that there were literally twenty-four elders. Therefore, the number twenty-four is a literal number and not a sign. If the twenty-four elders are the church, then one of the twenty-four elders speaking to John means that one twenty-fourth of the church was speaking to John. We know that this is impossible. If twenty-four here is a literal number, the elders must be literal too. Since the number twenty-four is not a sign, the elders are not a sign either. We cannot consider the elders as a sign and consider the number twenty-four as a literal number. Otherwise, it becomes completely absurd.</P><P>Therefore, it does not make sense for some to say that the twenty-four elders are the church. The twenty-four elders cannot be the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Fourth Reason</H2><P>First Thessalonians 4:16-17 says, "Because the Lord Himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord."</P><P>They quote this passage and argue, "Does this not refer to the rapture?" I say yes, and I believe that it does. But I would like to ask if 1 Thessalonians 4 mentions the time of our rapture. First Thessalonians 4 only tells us the fact of our rapture; it does not tell us when we will be raptured. If some say that this passage mentions the fact of the rapture, I would readily agree. But I cannot find the time of the rapture from this passage. No matter how I read it, forward or backward, I can only find the fact of the rapture; I cannot find evidence that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</P><P>A brother said to me once, "Do you not believe 1 Thessalonians 4?" I said, "First Thessalonians 4 does not say as much as you say. My 1 Thessalonians 4 only says that we will be raptured; it does not say that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation." This cannot be used as a proof. It is all right to take this verse as a proof that there will be a rapture. But it is not all right to take this verse as a proof that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Fifth Reason</H2><P>First Corinthians 15:51-52 says, "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed."</P><P>They argue that since it says we will all be changed, dead or alive, does it not mean that everyone will be raptured before the tribulation? I would say that this argument is the same as that in 1 Thessalonians 4. In fact, it only tells us that the church will be raptured; it does not tell us that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation. It does not say that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation; on the contrary, there is evidence that the rapture will take place after the tribulation. We see this from the words, "At the last trumpet...the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed." Which trumpet is the last trumpet? Only the book of Revelation talks about the seven trumpets. The seventh trumpet is the last trumpet. The last trumpet spoken of in 1 Corinthians 15 corresponds to the seventh trumpet mentioned in Revelation. If the last trumpet in 1 Corinthians 15 is trumpeted before the tribulation, how can there be, after this last trumpet, another seven trumpets being trumpeted in the tribulation? If the last trumpet is trumpeted before the tribulation, then there should not be another trumpeting during the tribulation. If the last trumpet is not the seventh trumpet in Revelation, then what trumpet does the last trumpet belong to? For instance, can someone say, "This is my last dollar, but I still have seven dollars"? If he says this, it would be very meaningless. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 15 is not a proof that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation; on the contrary, it proves that the rapture is after the tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Sixth Reason</H2><P>Luke 21:36 says, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man."</P><P>They argue that this verse clearly says "that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man." Is this not a promise that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation? Yes, this is a promise. But can this verse be considered a proof that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation? This verse does not promise that once a man is saved, he will not go through the tribulation. This verse does not exhort men to believe in the Lord and be regenerated quickly in order to escape the tribulation. This verse says, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching." This is something that takes place after salvation. A man is not saved by watching and beseeching. We are saved by grace and through faith. There is no direct relationship between the rapture and salvation. One is raptured through watching and beseeching. According to the original text of this verse, it can be translated as, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would be counted worthy to escape all these things which are about to happen, and stand before the Son of Man." Therefore, the rapture is not a matter of grace but a matter of being worthy. This verse is a promise, but it is a promise with conditions. If the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation, are all the Christians watching at every time and beseeching? If some of them are not, this verse cannot be used as an evidence that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Seventh Reason</H2><P>Revelation 3:10 says, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth."</P><P>These ones consider this verse to be the strongest proof. They argue that this verse clearly promises that the church will not pass through the tribulation. It is true that this verse is a promise. But does this verse say that all the Christians will be kept from the tribulation? No, it does not, because again, this verse has a condition; it is not unconditional. This verse does not promise that all the Christians will not go through the tribulation. It says, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial." It is because you have kept the word of His endurance that you will be preserved. The Lord preserves only the ones who keep the word of His endurance; He does not preserve everyone regardless of whether or not they keep His word.</P><P>What is keeping "the word of My endurance"? In Revelation 1, there are the words, "fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus" (v. 9). This tells us very clearly that today is the time we endure with Christ; our reigning with Christ will not take place until the future. Today is the time Christ endures. People revile Him, but He does not beat them to death; people curse Him, but He acts as if He has not even heard them; people oppose Him, but He does not threaten them. It seems that no matter how others treat Him, He does not care. Today is the time that He is opposed and blasphemed by men. This is the word of Christ's endurance. This is how Christ is, and this should be how all Christians are. Today there are many oppositions and persecutions, yet Christ endures them all. We ought to endure with Christ. Two thousand years have passed, and we have not seen Christ avenged once. He endures to such an extent that it seems as if He does not even exist in this universe.</P><P>However, has every regenerated and saved Christian, who has trusted in the blood, kept the word of Christ's endurance? If all Christians have kept the word of endurance, then they will not go through the tribulation. If there is one who has not kept the word of Christ's patience, this promise is not for him. This promise is conditional. If one has not met the condition, he cannot receive the benefit that is dictated by that condition.</P><P>One summer there was a Bible study in Kuling. A group of people were studying Revelation 2 and 3. One time I went and listened to their meeting. On that day they were talking about Revelation 3:10. One brother said, "There is a group of people who say that the whole church will not be raptured before the tribulation. How blind their eyes are! Does it not say clearly here that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation?" After the meeting, when I was walking with four or five brothers among them, I asked them, "Does this verse promise that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation? Have all the Christians kept the word of Christ's endurance today?" Of course they have not. If we only hold onto the promise of this verse and ignore the condition in the previous sentence, the whole world could hold onto the promise of John 3:16 and say that everyone in the world is saved. If someone would say this, you can tell him that he has missed several words, "Every one who believes into Him." "Every one who believes into Him" is a condition; "Would not perish, but would have eternal life" is a promise. One cannot just ask for eternal life without believing in the Lord. If a sinner does not believe, he will perish; he will not have eternal life. Likewise, if a Christian has not kept the word of Christ's endurance, he will not be kept out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth. Those who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation have left out the words, "Kept the word of My endurance." Therefore, the verse they quote cannot be counted as evidence.</P><P>They say that the promise is given to the whole church in Philadelphia. The church in Philadelphia has kept the word of Christ's endurance, and the church in Philadelphia represents the whole church. So it can be said that the whole church has kept the word of Christ's endurance, and thus the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</P><P>However, we must know that Revelation 2 through 3 talk about the seven churches in Asia at that specific time. These seven churches were actually present then. Although the seven churches indicate the seven ages of the church, the seven churches were present at the same time then. Did the Lord say the same words to the church in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, and Laodicea? No, He did not. Why did the Lord say these words only to the church in Philadelphia? The Lord's speaking to the church in Philadelphia proves that the church in Philadelphia does not represent all the churches. If it did, then the churches in Laodicea, Thyatira, and so forth would all have been given the same promise as the one to the church in Philadelphia.</P><P>In 1931 I was in Peking and I met a Western friend who said to me, "Did the Lord not promise the church in Philadelphia that they would not go through the trial? Does not the church in Philadelphia represent the whole church? Is not this a proof that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation?" I said, "The Lord gave the promise to the church in Philadelphia, but not all the churches are the church in Philadelphia. Therefore, the Lord did not promise all the churches."</P><P>All of these points show us that the reasons held by those who believe the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation cannot stand as valid. Besides this, they also made some basic mistakes. We will cover that too, but we have to wait until tomorrow.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RAPTURE AND THE TRIBULATION</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 49</H2><P>We have seen that the brothers who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation have reasons that are not reliable. Their idea lacks biblical proof. This is their first error. Today I want to discuss their second error.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Presumptions of Those Who Believe<br>That the Whole Church Will Be Raptured<br>before the Tribulation</H2><P>Our brothers who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation not only have farfetched reasons that are unable to stand as reasons, but they also have too many presumptions. Every time we speak about a biblical truth, whether it is as evidence or as background, it should be according to the Bible. If what is said requires too many presumptions and assumptions, it is not reliable. The brothers who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation rely upon too many presumptions. I will now point out their presumptions one by one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The First Presumption</H2><P>Our brothers say that Revelation 1 through 3 speak of the church, and that chapters three through nineteen do not speak of the church any longer, because from chapters four to nineteen the word church is not mentioned. Therefore, chapters one through three are on the church in this age, and chapters four through nineteen are on the future great tribulation. Since chapters four through nineteen do not mention the church, the church must not be on the earth any longer. Since the church is not on the earth, she must have been raptured to heaven.</P><P>Let us consider whether it is reasonable, as far as an argument goes, to make presumptions on the basis that a certain term is not explicitly mentioned. Although the word church is not explicitly mentioned in chapters four through nineteen, the fact of the church is still there. There are several examples.</P><P>Revelation 5:9 says, "And they sing a new song, saying...for You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation." If this group of people, who have been bought by the blood of the Lord, are not the church, who are they? Although the Scripture does not explicitly say that they are the church, can we say that they are not the church?</P><P>Revelation 6:9 says, "And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they had." If this group of people is not the church, who are they? Although the Scripture does not use the word church here, can we say that they are not the church?</P><P>Revelation 7:14 says, "These are those who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." If this group of people is not the church, who are they? Although the Scripture does not use the word church here, we all know that only the church can experience the washing of the robes by the blood of the Lamb.</P><P>Revelation 12:17 says, "The rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus." If this group of people is not the church, who are they? Although the Scripture does not use the word church here, can we say that they are not the church?</P><P>Revelation 17:6 says, "And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus." If this group of slain people is not the church, who are they? We all know that the woman here indicates the Roman Catholic Church. In the past, countless numbers of saints have been persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church. Countless numbers of saints were killed in Spain. Although the Scripture does not use the word church here, can we say that the slain ones here are not the church?</P><P>Revelation 19:11-14 says, "A white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True...And He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called the Word of God. And the armies which are in heaven followed Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean." Many people acknowledge that this is the scene when the Lord Jesus will come with the church to the earth. Even the brothers who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation acknowledge this. Does the Scripture here explicitly use the word church? Can we say that there is no church just because the Scripture does not use the word church here? Since our brothers admit that the church is in chapter nineteen, why do they deny it concerning the other chapters, which also show the fact of the church?</P><P>Revelation 22:6 says, "And he said to me, These words [indicating the whole book of Revelation, including chapters four through nineteen] are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place." Also verse 16 says, "I Jesus have sent My angel to testify to you these things [indicating the things recorded in the entire book of Revelation, including chapters four to nineteen] for the churches." This shows that though the word church is not mentioned in chapters four through nineteen, the sole purpose of mentioning them is for the churches. Therefore, how can we say that in chapters four through nineteen there is no mention of the church?</P><P>For our brothers to make such presumptions and assumptions is altogether wrong. We can see that the points we have mentioned prove that from chapters four to nineteen there are many instances where the fact of the church is mentioned. Although the word church is not explicitly mentioned from chapters four to nineteen, we cannot say that there is not the fact of the church there.</P><P>Moreover, our brothers say that in Revelation 21:9, the wife of the Lamb is the church (though according to the context preceding this verse, the wife of the Lamb refers to the New Jerusalem). May I ask if the word church is mentioned explicitly in 21:9? According to our brothers, since the word church is not mentioned explicitly, the church cannot be there. Why then would our brothers say that 21:9 refers to the church when the word church is not mentioned explicitly? If our brothers admit that the church is here, why do they not admit that the church is in the other chapters also? From this we see that such presumptions cannot stand.</P><P>If from chapters four to nineteen the church is still there, then their assumption that the whole church is raptured before the tribulation (beginning from chapter four) cannot stand. If there will still be people belonging to the church in the tribulation, how can we say that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Second Presumption</H2><P>Our brothers say that as soon as the whole church is raptured, many people will be saved on the earth who will become the so-called saints of the tribulation. They say that these people will be saved at the time of the great tribulation. Their scriptural basis is Revelation 7:9-17: "A great multitude which no one could number, out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues...These are those who come out of the great tribulation." Therefore, these people are saved at the time of the great tribulation. If our brothers admit that this group of people are believers that have passed through the tribulation, their theory collapses by itself. They can only say that this group of people is saved at the time of the great tribulation. In this way, they save their theory.</P><P>I am not saying that at the time of the great tribulation no one will be saved. Rather, I am saying that the people in Revelation 7:9-17 are not saved at the time of the great tribulation. I am not jumping to a conclusion. There is a basis for what I am saying.</P><P>(1)As far as the number goes, it does not seem possible for this group of people to be saved at the time of the great tribulation. At the time of the great tribulation, how can there be countless people being saved? At the time of the great tribulation, what is the largest number? Revelation 9:16 mentions two hundred million. The number in chapter seven, which no one could number, must be at least two hundred million. According to the census of the world population, today the whole world has only seventeen hundred million people. Revelation 6:8 says, "Authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and with death and by the beasts of the earth." This means about four hundred million people will die, leaving approximately twelve hundred million people. Revelation 9:15 says, "They might kill the third part of men." This means again over four hundred million people will die, leaving approximately eight hundred million people. Revelation 8:11 says, "Many of the men died." Revelation 11:13 says, "Seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake." This means seven thousand men of renown will die. It also means that an unknown number of the other nameless ones also will die. In chapters fifteen through sixteen we do not know how many more people will die, for that will be the actual great tribulation. In Revelation 9:16, the number of the army of the horsemen is two hundred million. Matthew 25 says that when the Lord comes again to the earth, there will still be many goats and sheep. Excluding these, how many people will be left? In considering the numbers, to say that a countless number of people will be saved at the time of the great tribulation is not logical.</P><P>(2)Looking from a historical perspective, it is also impossible that this group of people is saved at the time of the great tribulation. Is it possible that the aggregate result of the testimony of the apostles on the earth, the testimony of the saints on the earth throughout the ages, and the testimony of the church on the earth throughout the past two thousand years would not come up to the amount accomplished right before the end? Can we say that the number of all the people saved during the past two thousand years is less than the number saved during the tribulation? Nowhere in the Bible do we find any teaching concerning the kind of believers that appear during the tribulation. Therefore, realistically speaking, to say that this group is saved during the great tribulation is impossible.</P><P>(3)Circumstantially speaking, this is also impossible. We know that the judgments that descend from God are divided into seals, trumpets, and bowls. But the judgments of the seals and the trumpets are different from the judgments of the bowls. The seals and the trumpets are God's remedial punishments with the hope that men would repent because of the punishments. As for the bowls, they are simply God's punishments. No one can hope to repent because of these punishments. Therefore, in Revelation 9:20-21, after the seals and the trumpets, there are the words, "The rest of the men...did not repent," and "They did not repent." But after the bowls there is no mention of repentance.</P><P>Therefore, during the great tribulation, the Bible shows us clearly that some people will be killed by the tribulation, while the rest will remain unrepentant. Where is the uncountable number of people saved during the tribulation? This is not to mention the fact that at that time the "triune" Satan will be deceiving and coercing on the earth.</P><P>If this group of countless numbers of people is not saved during the great tribulation, they must be the church saved before the great tribulation. If they are the church, how can we say that the whole church will be raptured before the great tribulation? (As to the detailed explanation of this group of people, I will publish it in my Meditations on Revelation, if the Lord wills.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Third Presumption</H2><P>Our brothers say that during the great tribulation the Holy Spirit will no longer be on the earth, for when the Lord Jesus raptures the church to the heavens, He also raptures the Holy Spirit to the heavens, so that the Holy Spirit will no longer be on the earth. They base their words on 2 Thessalonians 2:6-8: "And now you know that which restrains, so that he might be revealed in his own time. For it is the mystery of lawlessness that is now operating, but only until the one now restraining goes out of the way. And then the lawless one will be revealed." They say that here is a great sinner, who is the son of perdition, and who is commonly called the Antichrist. The restraining one is the Holy Spirit. After the Holy Spirit is taken out of the way, the lawless one will be revealed. How is the Holy Spirit taken out of the way? The Holy Spirit will be taken out of the way by being raptured. After this, Antichrist will be revealed and the great tribulation will begin. They say, "Since the Holy Spirit will no longer be on the earth, how can the church still be on the earth? Therefore, the whole church must have been raptured before the tribulation."</P><P>Can such a presumption stand? It cannot. We have much biblical evidence to prove that such a presumption is wrong.</P><P>(1) First we need to ask, is the restraining one the Holy Spirit? The Bible calls the Holy Spirit by many names, for example, the Spirit, the Spirit of wisdom, the Spirit of revelation, and so forth. There are also many other names with the word Spirit attached. True, the Bible also calls the Holy Spirit a consoling One or the Comforter. But immediately after this, the Bible tells us that this is the Spirit of truth. Which verse in the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is the restraining one? There is no verse in the Bible that says that the Holy Spirit is the restraining one. Saying that the restraining one is the Holy Spirit is clearly a presumption.</P><P>(2) Can the expression "goes out of the way" be explained as "is being raptured"? It says "goes out of the way," not "raptured out of the way." Is "going out of the way" a likely expression to describe the Holy Spirit? Can we say that "to go out of the way" is to be raptured? The Bible does not allow us to say this. This shows that saying that going out of the way is to be raptured is again a presumption.</P><P>(3) Does the Bible say that during the great tribulation the Holy Spirit will not be on the earth? Our brothers say that there is no Holy Spirit on the earth during the great tribulation. They also say that during the great tribulation countless people will be saved. How can these two things be reconciled? The Holy Spirit is no longer on the earth; yet there are more people saved than when the Holy Spirit was on the earth. What kind of teaching is this? I believe that if there is one person saved during the great tribulation, it will still be the work of the Holy Spirit on the earth, because that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is the spirit.</P><P>(4) Revelation 4:5 says, "Seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God." Revelation 5:6 says, "I saw...a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth." The Bible tells us that during the great tribulation the Holy Spirit does work, for the Bible says He is "sent forth into all the earth."</P><P>(5) The Bible never says that the Holy Spirit is raptured to heaven before the great tribulation. On the contrary, it says that during the great tribulation the Holy Spirit will be greatly poured out as the latter rain. Concerning this, we can read the following two paragraphs in the Bible.</P><P>Joel 2:28-32 says, "And afterward I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh,/And your sons and your daughters will prophesy;/Your old men will dream dreams;/Your young men will see visions./Indeed even upon the servants and the maids /In those days I will pour out My Spirit./And I will do wonders in the heavens and on earth:/Blood and fire and pillars of smoke./The sun will be turned into darkness,/And the moon, into blood,/Before the great and terrible/Day of Jehovah comes./And all who call on the name of Jehovah will be saved."</P><P>Acts 2:15-21 says, "For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is the third hour of the day; but this is what is spoken through the prophet Joel: `And it shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream things in dreams; and indeed upon My slaves, both men and women, I will pour out of My Spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy. And I will show wonders in heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord comes. And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'"</P><P>Here I would like to draw your attention to what Peter said, "But this is what is spoken through the prophet Joel." Peter did not say the day of Pentecost fulfilled what Joel said. The day of Pentecost did not fulfill literally what Joel said. The day of Pentecost did not have the five unusual scenes described in Joel 2:30-31: "Blood and fire and pillars of smoke./The sun will be turned into darkness,/And the moon, into blood." There were no such unusual scenes at Pentecost. When will Joel's word be fulfilled? It will be fulfilled at the great tribulation. We can look for these five unusual scenes in Revelation.</P><P>Revelation 6:12 says, "When He opened the sixth seal...the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood." The unusual scenes of the sun and the moon here match Joel's word.</P><P>In Revelation 8:7-10, at the sounding of the first and second trumpets, there is fire and blood. When the third trumpet is sounded, there is also fire. These match Joel's word concerning the unusual scenes of fire and blood.</P><P>In Revelation 9:2, at the sounding of the fifth trumpet, smoke rises out of the pit of the abyss like the smoke of a great furnace. This also matches Joel's word of the scene of the pillars of smoke.</P><P>Therefore, we can say that these things will be greatly fulfilled during the great tribulation. The Holy Spirit will be poured out greatly at that time. The time of Pentecost was but a foretaste. Therefore, Peter did not say it "fulfilled" what Joel said. He merely said that it was that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel. It means that particular situation was somewhat similar to what Joel had spoken. It means that particular situation resembled the events spoken of by Joel.</P><P>Therefore, according to Joel, during the tribulation the Holy Spirit will do an unprecedented work. At that time, without the power of the Holy Spirit, men will surely not be able to stand the many persecutions and afflictions. Based on what Joel said, the Holy Spirit will not be raptured during the tribulation; rather, He will be poured out as never before and will do an extraordinary work.</P><P>If during the great tribulation the Holy Spirit is still on the earth, then our brothers' reasoning, that the Holy Spirit's rapture means the church's rapture, no longer has any biblical foundation to it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Fourth Presumption</H2><P>Our brothers say that the disciples in the Gospels all refer to Jewish disciples, and not to the church, because the church was not formed until Pentecost. The disciples were Jewish disciples, whereas we are Christians; therefore, what the Lord said in the four Gospels has nothing to do with us Christians. Only the Epistles, and only the Epistles written by Paul in prison have something to do with us.</P><P>Why do they say this? It is because in the four Gospels the Lord always says to watch and prepare for His coming back, and that if one does not, he will be left behind when the Lord comes back. Since they advocate that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation, they can only push the Lord's warnings to the disciples in the four Gospels upon the so-called Jewish disciples. In the four Gospels, the Lord never said that all of the saved ones would be raptured at once. The Lord always said that only the watchful and prepared ones would be raptured. They know that the whole church is composed of saved ones, but not all are watchful and prepared. Therefore, if the whole church is to be raptured before the tribulation, they must prove that the commandments to watch and be prepared are not for the church. In this way, the church will not be divided into two groups-the watchful ones and the unwatchful ones, the prepared ones and the unprepared ones. Otherwise, they cannot get over this big obstacle. We can prove that it is a presumption to say that the disciples are not Christians. Were not the twelve disciples Christians? We say yes, and we have the following reasons:</P><P>(1) If the twelve disciples were not Christians, why does the Bible pay so much attention to transitional matters? Matthew has twenty-eight chapters, Mark has sixteen chapters. If one says the four Gospels are for the so-called Jewish disciples, why does the Bible use so many chapters to record the transitional matters, yet use a few books that have only a few short chapters to record the things concerning the Christians?</P><P>(2) It is true that at that time the disciples were Jews. But at the time of Pentecost, were they not still this same group of people? Were not those who were called the pillars of the church the same group of people? Even though the designation might be different, were they not the same group of people? Before Pentecost and before the church was established, had not the Lord already chosen them? Did not the Lord cultivate these ones to be seeds, to be the foundation? Did not the Lord especially intend for them to bear the responsibility in the church? Suppose a certain person intends to open a department store. Before he opens it, he trains a group of people in advance, teaching them the general knowledge of commerce. After the store opens, can this group of people say that the training they had previously received cannot be used any longer? It is true that the church was not yet established, but can we say that the teachings received before this cannot be used, and that only what Paul has written is useful? Can we set aside all the words of instructions and warnings given by the Lord? (Of course, we admit that in the Gospels many times the Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples as Jews. We will speak about this in detail in Study on Matthew. At present, it suffices to say just a word of distinction: with regard to things of the environment, the Lord regarded His disciples as Jews; with regard to spiritual things, the Lord regarded His disciples as the church.)</P><P>(3) Does the Bible say explicitly that the disciples were Christians? Acts 11:26 says, "The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch." Does this not mean that the disciples were Christians? Moreover, the name Christian was the name others used to mock the disciples at that time. They put this name upon the disciples to mock them for being like Christ. Can we say that because a person has two names he is then two persons? Can we say that since the disciples were later called Christians, that everything related to them when they were called disciples is not related to them as Christians? The disciples were the Christians; they were the church.</P><P>(4) Another evidence is Matthew 28:19: "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." Here it says to disciple all the nations. This means that all the saved persons in this world are disciples, and that the Jews are not the only ones who are disciples. The term "all the nations" is the same as "Gentiles" in the original text. The nations spoken of in Matthew are the Gentiles. These ones say that the disciples are the Jews, but the Bible and the Lord say that among the disciples there are not only Jews, but Gentiles also. Therefore, the words that the Lord spoke to the Jewish disciples in the four Gospels are also for the Gentile disciples, because the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, were the disciples of the Lord Jesus.</P><P>From this we see that the words that the Lord Jesus spoke to His disciples concerning watching and preparing were spoken to all the Christians. Therefore, everyone who does not watch and prepare as the Lord commanded is liable to suffer loss at the Lord's coming. Thus, how can the whole church-watching or not watching, prepared or not prepared-be raptured before the tribulation?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Fifth Presumption</H2><P>Our brothers say that all the words, that is, all the teachings, spoken by the Lord in the four Gospels were for the Jews. (Mr. Scofield said that Matthew 5-7 uplifts the law to a most fearful position.)</P><P>Now we want to consider if the Lord's words were to those under the law, or to the Christians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. What the Lord Himself Said</H2><P>Matthew 28:20 says, "Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age." This word was spoken by the Lord to all the disciples when He was living on the earth. He commanded His disciples to go and disciple all the nations. He also charged the disciples to teach them with His teachings that they may keep them. Therefore, all the teachings in the Gospels are spoken to the Christians, not to the Jews. The Lord's commandments were not only given to the disciples of that time, but also to those who heard the apostles' teaching and believed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. What the Holy Spirit Said</H2><P>John 14:26 says, "But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and remind you of all the things which I have said to you." The Holy Spirit will cause us to remember every word, whatever they are. In other words, the Holy Spirit wants to lead us back to the words of the Lord Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. What Paul Said</H2><P>Colossians 3:16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom." This is what Paul charged the Christians in Colossae to do.</P><P>But what about today? Those friends who believe the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation say that the teachings of the four Gospels were spoken to the Jews, not to the Christians. But this is not what the Lord, or the Holy Spirit, or Paul told us. The Holy Spirit and Paul both bring us back to the teachings of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels.</P><P>Why do our brothers say that the teachings of the four Gospels have nothing to do with the church? It is because there are so many places in the four Gospels that say that whosoever does not watch and pray and does not prepare in waiting will be left behind when the Lord comes. If we cite a verse from the Gospels which mentions that the rapture is conditioned upon being watchful and prepared, they will answer that these words are for the Jews and not for the Christians. Whether or not one is watchful or prepared, according to them, he will be raptured as long as he is in the church. This is just man's theory. The Lord did not say this; the Holy Spirit did not say this; and Paul did not say this. Therefore, such presumption cannot stand.</P><P>If the teachings of Christ while He was on the earth were spoken to us, the church, then we know that to be regenerated alone is not enough. We must also be diligently watching and preparing. It is impossible for the whole church (the born again ones) to be raptured before the tribulation, because the whole church is not watchful and prepared.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Sixth Presumption</H2><P>Matthew 24:14 says, "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come." Our brothers say that the gospel of the kingdom is different from the gospel of grace. The church is saved through the gospel of grace. The gospel of the kingdom is for the Jews. They say that there are two stages for the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom. One is when the Lord was living on the earth; one is at the time of the great tribulation. The church preaches the gospel of grace, not the gospel of the kingdom.</P><P>Why do they say that the gospel of grace is toward the church and the gospel of the kingdom is toward the Jews? This is because they advocate that we depend on grace for everything; even our rapture depends on grace. Watching and preparing is work, not grace. What is spoken of in the four Gospels is the kingdom; therefore, the references to preparing and watching in them are all for the Jews and not related to Christians. They pay special attention to distinguishing the gospel of grace from the gospel of the kingdom; yet little do they know that the gospel of God is only one. In letter, the gospel of grace and the gospel of the kingdom, of course, have their own special distinctions. But, in fact, the gospel of the kingdom includes the gospel of grace. Therefore, the truths of the kingdom are for us. We should not shovel them upon the Jews just because they are deep and make demands upon us. Not only do the Gospels speak about the kingdom; even the book of Acts, which speaks the most about the church, speaks about the kingdom also. Let us see what the book of Acts says regarding this. By this we will see the kingdom's relationship to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. What the Lord Jesus Preached</H2><P>Acts 1:3 says, "To whom also He presented Himself alive after His suffering by many irrefutable proofs, appearing to them through a period of forty days and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God." After the Lord's resurrection, what was He speaking about for forty days? He spoke of the things pertaining to the kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. What Philip Preached</H2><P>Acts 8:12 says, "But when they believed Philip, who announced the gospel of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women." Here it says that the gospel which Philip preached was the gospel of the kingdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. What Paul Preached</H2><P>Acts 14:22 says, "Establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith and saying that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God." This is what Paul and Barnabas encouraged the disciples with. Does it say here that the gospel of the kingdom is not the gospel of grace?</P><P>Acts 19:8 says, "And he entered into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them in the things concerning the kingdom of God." Here it says that Paul, for the space of three months, reasoned and persuaded them in the things concerning the kingdom of God. If this is not about grace, what is it about?</P><P>Acts 20:24-25 says, "But I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify of the gospel of the grace of God. And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more." What kind of gospel did Paul say he preached? The first part says, "Testify of the gospel of the grace of God," and the second part says, "Proclaiming the kingdom." From this we can see that the proclaiming of the kingdom of God is equal to the gospel of the grace of God. On the one hand, it says the gospel of the grace of God; on the other hand, it says the gospel of the grace of God is the proclaiming of the kingdom of God. Who can say that the gospel of grace is different from the gospel of the kingdom? Paul said that the gospel of the kingdom is equal to the gospel of grace.</P><P>Acts 20:31 says, "Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears." This is the end of the apostle's work. The apostle never ceased preaching about the kingdom of God.</P><P>Where in the Bible does it say that the gospel of the kingdom has nothing to do with us Christians? The Bible does not say this. On the contrary, the Bible says that the proclaiming of the kingdom of God is the gospel of grace. We can see that this kind of presumption is not reliable. This shows us that the teachings concerning watching and preparing in the Gospels are spoken to us Christians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Seventh Presumption</H2><P>Our brothers say that the work that the Lord did on the earth was basically for the Jews. The Lord's ministry was to the circumcision; therefore, we can see that the Lord specially served the Jews. In other words, the age of the gospel began after the Lord died.</P><P>Is what they say reliable? It is not reliable. I am not saying that when the Lord was living on the earth there was not the Jewish background. The Jews had the law, the covenant, and the promise from the past. The law also ended at the Lord's death. But according to the Bible, the age of the gospel did not begin at the Lord's death, but even while the Lord was working on the earth. There is much evidence for this. These ones insist on putting the Lord's work under the law. They say that the church is under grace and not under the law; therefore, all the commandments and warnings of the Lord in the Gospels do not have anything to do with the church. But the Bible does not permit them to presume this way. Let us see what the Bible says concerning the time the law ended and the gospel began.</P><P>(1) Matthew 11:13 says, "For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John." Luke 16:16 says, "The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed as the gospel, and everyone forces his way into it." The Bible tells us that the law ended when John came out to preach. Since that time, that is, since John began to preach, the gospel of the kingdom was preached. The Bible does not say that the law ended at the cross. The Bible does not say that the law ended at Pentecost. The Bible does not say that the law ended with Stephen. The Bible does not say that the law ended at Paul's preaching. The Bible does not say that the law ended at Acts 28. The Bible does say that the law ended at John. Although at that time the two sides were still not clear, and although it was not until the cross that everything was settled, the age of the gospel had, nevertheless, begun.</P><P>(2) Acts 10:36-37 says, "The word which He sent to the sons of Israel in announcing the gospel of peace through Jesus Christ...the word which has been spoken throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed." As soon as John the Baptist began preaching on baptism, the age of the gospel began.</P><P>(3) Acts 13:23-26 says, "From this man's seed, God, according to promise, brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, after John had proclaimed, prior to His public entrance, a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. Now as John was completing his course, he said, What do you suppose that I am? I am not the Christ. But behold, One is coming after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie. Men, brothers, sons of the race of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us the word of this salvation has been sent forth." We need to take note that the time "the word of this salvation" began was the time the age of the gospel began. When did the word of this salvation begin? It began with John the Baptist. Therefore, the age of the gospel also began at this time.</P><P>(4) Mark 1:1 says, "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God." If we read from verse 1 through verse 15, we will realize that the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, began when John the Baptist preached the baptism of repentance. This is most clear. The Bible does not say that the gospel began at Christ's death.</P><P>(5) Luke 4:17-19 says, "And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, `The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.'" We say that the things recorded here belong to the gospel of grace. When did the Lord say they began? Verse 21 says, "And He began to say to them, Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing." The Lord said, "Today"; that is, it was fulfilled in that day. The age of the gospel began in that day and not at His death.</P><P>(6) John 4:23 says, "But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him." How did the people in the age of the law worship God? It was according to the flesh and according to rituals. The cleansing was according to the flesh; the defilement was also according to the flesh. But the Lord said, "But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him." When do we worship Him in spirit and in truth? It is in the time of grace. The Lord said, "It is now." We see that day was the time of grace. The Lord said, "It is now."</P><P>(7) John 5:25 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live." Is this the law or the gospel? We all know that this is the gospel. The Lord said, "It is now." Does this not mean that the age of the gospel began then? It did not have to wait for a later day, but "It is now."</P><P>According to the verses we have quoted, we can conclude that when Christ was living on the earth, the age of the gospel had begun. It did not begin in Matthew 28, nor in Acts 2, nor in Acts 28. The age of the gospel began when the Lord Jesus came out to work. This being the case, all of the words in the four Gospels are for the Christians. In this way, the words that indicate that the rapture is only for those who are watching, praying, and preparing, as spoken of in the four Gospels, are for all the Christians. If this is the case, not all Christians will be raptured before the tribulation. Therefore, the condition for the rapture is not regeneration, but being watchful. Since this is the case, how can we say that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation?</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RAPTURE AND THE TRIBULATION</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 50</H2><P>The previous two times I spoke about those who advocated that the whole church would be raptured before the tribulation. I mentioned how unsound their reasoning was and how excessive their assertions were. Tonight I am going to speak on another matter: does the Bible ever say that the saints will pass through the tribulation?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROOF THAT THE CHURCH<br>WILL PASS THROUGH THE TRIBULATION</H2><P>In the Bible there are many proofs that the saints will pass through the tribulation. Today I will only mention three. We can read the following verses.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The First Proof</H2><P>Second Thessalonians 2:1-3 says, "Now we ask you, brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, that you be not quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. Let no one deceive you in any way, because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition."</P><P>We must read this passage of the Bible carefully, because this passage has a great deal to do with the subject we are studying. What is the subject of this passage? It not only speaks of the coming of Christ, nor does it only speak of our gathering together to Him. Rather, it speaks of the coming of Christ and our gathering together to Him. This passage of the Bible puts the coming of Christ and the rapture of the saints together. It is neither His coming to the earth, nor our going to the heavens. Rather, He is coming while we are going.</P><P>Since this passage talks about the coming of Christ and the rapture of the saints, are there any clues that show us whether the rapture of the saints is before or after the tribulation? I claim that in this passage there are clues.</P><P>Verse 2 says, "That you be not quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come." There is a big question here. What does "the day of the Lord" mean? Our friends say that the day of the Lord refers to the great tribulation. Why do they say that? They have their reason. They believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation. This is how their reasoning goes. How could there be the great tribulation if we have not been raptured?</P><P>It is true that in the Old Testament there are places where the phrase "the day of the Lord" includes the great tribulation. This is a fact. However, not all of the references to "the day of the Lord" in the Bible refer to the great tribulation. When the Old Testament speaks of the day of the Lord, for the most part it refers to the special judgment of God at the end of the great tribulation (Joel). Therefore, it is definitely wrong to say that "the day of the Lord" always refers to the great tribulation. Let us read 2 Peter 3:10: "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements, burning with intense heat, will be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it will be burned up." What does this refer to? It refers to the destruction of the old heavens and the old earth by God after the great tribulation. Such a day is also referred to as the day of the Lord. In most cases in the Old Testament, "the day of the Lord" refers to the great tribulation. But we cannot say that in every case it refers to the great tribulation. Second Peter 3:10 is such an example. Not only does 2 Peter 3:10 prove this, but also the whole context of 2 Thessalonians 2:1-3 proves this. There, in the first verse, the subject is "with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him." Verse 2 mentions "the day of the Lord." The day of the Lord mentioned there must naturally refer to the day of the coming of Christ and our gathering together to Him, which was described in verse 1.</P><P>At that time, the Thessalonians had a problem. Some were saying that the day of the Lord had already come. Paul's intention was to persuade them not to be shaken by this kind of word. He wanted them to realize that the intent of those who spoke to them in this way was to tempt them.</P><P>How can one know if the day of the Lord has come? Let us see verse 3: "Because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition." "The day" here is just the day in verse 1. In order to know whether or not the day of the Lord has come, you only need to consider two things: there must be an apostasy, and the man of lawlessness must be revealed. If these have happened, Christ will come soon. There must first be the apostasy and the revelation of the man of lawlessness before the rapture of the saints will occur. We have to hold fast to the fact that before the rapture of the saints, there must be first the revelation of the man of lawlessness. This is what Paul tells us in 2 Thessalonians 2. The rapture of the saints occurs after the revelation of the man of lawlessness.</P><P>Who is this man of lawlessness? He is none other than Antichrist. The rapture of the saints takes place after Antichrist has been revealed. When is Antichrist revealed? Everyone who studies the Bible knows that it occurs in the great tribulation. This is commonly acknowledged by all the Bible students in the whole world. This proves that the rapture occurs after the great tribulation.</P><P>From 2 Thessalonians 2:1-3, we can see that the rapture follows after the revelation of the Antichrist, or the great tribulation. Here we see that there is at least a group, or at the very least an individual, who is raptured after the great tribulation. Those who advocate the pre-tribulation rapture of the whole church say that the day of the Lord mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 2 is equivalent to the great tribulation. What is their proof? In reading the Scriptures, we cannot ignore the whole context. Here "the day of the Lord" clearly refers to the day of the Lord's coming and our rapture. If they want to refer to the Old Testament, they also must not discard 2 Peter 3:10. There it proves that the day of the Lord is not the great tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Second Proof</H2><P>First Corinthians 15:51-52 says, "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed."</P><P>First Thessalonians 4:16-17 says, "Because the Lord Himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord."</P><P>Each of these two passages of the Bible has its own emphasis. First Thessalonians 4 emphasizes the rapture and resurrection, whereas 1 Corinthians 15 emphasizes resurrection and transfiguration. First Corinthians 15 does not explicitly mention the rapture. However, everyone admits that both 1 Corinthians 15 and 1 Thessalonians 4 will take place at the same time. Not only do all the Bible readers admit this, but I myself acknowledge this also. This being the case, let us see if there is any clue concerning the timing of the rapture in these two passages. Yes, there is. "The trumpet of God" is a good clue. There are many trumpets of God. Of these trumpets which is the last trumpet? At what time does it sound?</P><P>The "last" trumpet in 1 Corinthians 15 can also be translated as the "ending" trumpet. First Corinthians 15 tells us that the trumpet mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4 is the last trumpet. Therefore, we have a very clear clue regarding the timing of the rapture of the Christians. First Corinthians 15 says, "At the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound." When does the last trumpet sound? Our friends say that the last trumpet sounds before the tribulation, because 1 Corinthians says that the church will be raptured at the sounding of the last trumpet. Since they advocate that the whole church will be raptured before the great tribulation, they have to conclude that the last trumpet will be sounded before the great tribulation. However, no matter how one studies the Bible, forwards or backwards, one can never find a proof for this kind of saying. They say this just because they want to say it.</P><P>The Bible never says that the last trumpet sounds before the great tribulation; on the contrary, there is a clue which shows us that it sounds after the great tribulation. The book of Revelation speaks of three sevens in regard to the tribulation: seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls. Revelation says that at the time of the great tribulation seven trumpets will be sounded. According to our friends, the last trumpet will have been sounded before the great tribulation. How can seven more trumpets be sounded? This is like someone saying, "This is my last dollar, but I still have seven more dollars in my pocket." Does it sound logical? Does it make any sense?</P><P>What kind of trumpet is this last trumpet? According to the Bible, the most natural and fair conclusion is that it corresponds to the seventh trumpet in Revelation. I believe that every fair reader would admit this. Our friends would say that perhaps this last trumpet is not the seventh trumpet because the seventh trumpet is sounded during the great tribulation. They say that this last trumpet is the last trumpet of the church. Then I would ask, when did the church sound its first trumpet? Did the church ever sound a first trumpet? I have read through the New Testament a number of times, and I have never seen any trumpet of the church. There is not a first trumpet, so how could there be a last trumpet?</P><P>There was a brother who admitted the deficiency of this kind of interpretation. He said that at the time of the Roman Empire, troops started marching at the sound of the last trumpet. Can we then say that the last trumpet here is the last trumpet for the Roman troops? The Bible says that it is the trumpet of God, not the trumpet of Rome. If we are going to say that it is the trumpet of Rome, then can we not say that it is the trumpet of China? First Corinthians 15, which says the last trumpet, is parallel to 1 Thessalonians 4, which says the trumpet of God. It is clearly not the trumpet of Rome; even the more, it is not the trumpet of China. Regarding this trumpet, they have two interpretations: the trumpet of the church and the trumpet of Rome. However, 1 Thessalonians 4 says that it is neither the trumpet of the church, nor the trumpet of Rome, but the trumpet of God. Only Revelation has the trumpet of God.</P><P>Now let us see whether or not this last trumpet matches the seventh trumpet in Revelation. If they do not match, we will have nothing to say. But if they do, then we have to admit that they are the same thing.</P><P>Revelation 10:7 says, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to trumpet, then the mystery of God is finished, as He has announced the good news to His own slaves the prophets." This verse tells us one thing. When the seventh angel sounds the trumpet, the mystery of God is finished. We would like to ask one question. What is the mystery of God?</P><P>Please remember that in the Bible there are different ages. From Moses to Christ, everything was revealed. Nothing was a mystery; everything was manifested. It will be the same way in the coming millennium. In the future the communion between God and man will be face to face, visible. It is only in this age that the communion between God and man is neither like that in the past nor like that in the future. Today we are in between the two. We cannot see God with our physical eyes, nor can we see Christ or the Holy Spirit. This age is the age of the mystery of God. Actually, this age began with Christ. First Timothy 3:16 says, "And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh." From Matthew 13 onward, everything is a mystery. Previously it was open and uncovered, but now it is no longer so. The church is also a mystery. How the Gentiles are blessed by God is a mystery. Christ in us is also a mystery.</P><P>When does the Bible say that the mystery ceases? It ceases at the seventh trumpet, not before the tribulation. If the whole church is raptured before the tribulation, then the mystery would be finished before the great tribulation begins. But the Bible says that the mystery is finished at the sounding of the seventh trumpet. Therefore, the church must remain on the earth and not be raptured until the sounding of the seventh trumpet.</P><P>Romans 16:25-26 says, "Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel, that is, the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which has been kept in silence in the times of the ages but has now been manifested, and through the prophetic writings, according to the command of the eternal God, has been made known to all the Gentiles for the obedience of faith." If we compare what is spoken here with Revelation 10:7, we can identify places where they match. First, the subject of Romans is the mystery of God; the subject of Revelation is also the mystery of God. Second, in Romans it says that God preaches through the prophets; in Revelation it also says the same thing. Third, in Romans it mentions the gospel; in Revelation it also mentions the good news. The original Greek word in these two places is the same. Therefore, we can definitely conclude that the mystery of God in Romans and the mystery of God in Revelation are the same thing. They are of the same nature. If we take a blank sheet of paper and write Romans 16:25-26 on one half and Revelation 10:7 on the other half, and compare them, we would have to admit that they are talking about the same thing. The only difference is that Romans tells us the beginning of the mystery, whereas Revelation tells us the end of the mystery. According to Revelation, when will this mystery cease? It ceases at the sounding of the seventh trumpet. There is no question about this point.</P><P>Resurrection and transfiguration are also a mystery. First Corinthians 15:51 says, "Behold, I tell you a mystery." Our friends think that this mystery ceases before the tribulation. But the Bible says that it does not cease until the sounding of the seventh trumpet. Not only does the Bible say this; it continues on to give us even more proofs.</P><P>Revelation 11:15-18 says, "And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever. And the twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned. And the nations became angry, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to give the reward to Your slaves the prophets and to the saints and to those who fear Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth." This passage shows us further that both the rapture and resurrection have to wait until the seventh trumpet. Here is something quite particular. When the seventh trumpet sounded, the twenty-four elders fell on their faces and worshipped God and uttered those words of worship. The sounding of the seventh trumpet especially indicates that God has won the victory. Therefore, this trumpet is unique because of its importance.</P><P>"And the time came for the dead to be judged." Many of the dead will be resurrected after the millennium and judged at the white throne. However, the judgment of the dead here comes right before the receiving of the reward. So the judgment of the dead here is to determine who deserves the first resurrection and who deserves the second. Therefore, the judgment of the dead here is the time of the resurrection of the dead and the transfiguration of the living mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15. God judges to determine who is deserving and who is not deserving. This will happen at the sounding of the last trumpet. Revelation, on the other hand, says that such a thing will happen at the sounding of the seventh trumpet. From this we can see that these two passages correspond to each other.</P><P>"And the time to give the reward...to the small and to the great." This happens at the judgment seat. It shows us clearly that the sounding of the seventh trumpet is at the end of the tribulation. Once the seventh trumpet is sounded, the millennial kingdom will be in sight.</P><P>The preceding two proofs have shown us that the rapture of the saints occurs at the sounding of the seventh trumpet. In the following section, I am going to combine several small points as a further proof that there are saints who will pass through the tribulation before they will be raptured.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Third Proof</H2><P>Matthew 28:20 says, "Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age." Please note that it is the end of the age, not the end of the world. The Lord said, "I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age." Let me ask you. If the whole church is raptured before the tribulation, then would the length of the time for the Lord to be with the church be at least three and a half years shorter? Of course, I am not saying that this is a big proof, but I am saying that this is a small proof.</P><P>Acts 2:34-35 says, "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet." The Lord will wait until the foes of Christ become the footstool of Christ. We know that this is at the end of the great tribulation. God will destroy those Gentiles who have destroyed the world and will give the authority to Christ. Then the enemies will become Christ's footstool. God says, "Until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet." But our friends say that Christ has left the Father's throne even before God has made His enemies His footstool. It seems as if they are saying that Christ cannot wait. This point is also a small clue.</P><P>Furthermore, no one who studies Revelation carefully can ever say that Christ would leave the throne and come to the air before the tribulation. There is no such record in Revelation. I have never seen it. If indeed Christ comes to the air before the tribulation, how could Revelation forget to record this matter which is the center of the prophecy? Revelation 14:1-5 speaks of the firstfruits. Verses 6 through 13 speak of the tribulation. Verses 14 through 15 speak of Christ's coming to the air. In other words, Christ's coming to the air to receive the saints takes place after Revelation 6-12. From this we can see that the rapture of the saints occurs after the great tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN BELIEVING<br>THAT THE ENTIRE CHURCH WILL PASS<br>THROUGH THE TRIBULATION</H2><P>Does this mean that the entire church will pass through the tribulation? According to the Bible, there is no mention that the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation. One brother received a letter from a friend which said that whoever believes that the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation has someone else reading the Bible for him. This means that he believes whatever others say without investigating it. The Bible does not say that the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation. Does the Bible say that the entire church will be raptured after the tribulation? No, it does not say that either. The Bible does say that among the ones who have been saved and born again, a small number will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas the majority will be raptured after the tribulation.</P><P>Those who say that the entire church will be raptured after the tribulation have the following fundamental errors.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Watching and Waiting Becoming Meaningless</H2><P>Those who hold the concept that the entire church will pass through the tribulation cannot watch and be prepared for the Lord Jesus. Since they know that before the rapture there must be three and a half years of tribulation, there is no need for them to be prepared or to be watchful. Furthermore, since they know they have to wait three and a half years before Christ would come, it is not too late to delay watching until even three or five months before the end of the three and a half years. But the Bible tells us to watch always, to pray unceasingly, and to be ready for the Lord's coming back. If the entire church will pass through the tribulation, one could begin to get ready a few days before the end of the three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Not Waiting for the Lord but for the Antichrist</H2><P>If the entire church passes through the tribulation, our living on the earth will not be filled with waiting for Christ but for Antichrist. Daily we will only need to look and see if Antichrist has come. Thus, our eyes will be on the surroundings instead of looking above. This is contrary to the teaching of the Bible, for the Bible does not tell us to wait for Antichrist, but to wait for the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Looking for the Tribulation<br>Rather Than Looking for the Blessing</H2><P>If the entire church passes through the tribulation, all that the church can look forward to is the tribulation and suffering. Thus, it will be without hope. Where then is the blessed hope of the church? Will not the phrase in Titus 2:13, "Awaiting the blessed hope," become meaningless? If the entire church passes through the tribulation, it will not be awaiting the blessed hope, but will be looking forward to the tribulation. This is contrary to the principle and spirit of the Bible. This kind of concept is too much.</P><P>Those who believe the entire church will pass through the tribulation have the following additional errors in their interpretation of the Bible:</P><P>(1) They only acknowledge the open rapture. But the Lord said, "I come as a thief" (Rev. 16:15). When a thief comes, does he come with great announcement or with great ceremony? A thief comes unnoticed. Furthermore, he comes to steal valuable and precious things. The Lord will come to take what is precious to Him. But unlike the thief, who takes things that belong to others, the Lord takes only what belongs to Him.</P><P>(2) They greatly undervalue the position of the Jews. These friends who believe the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation say all the disciples at the Lord's time were Jews (positionally speaking) and none of them were Christians. This is too much. Those friends who believe that the entire church passes through the tribulation say that all the disciples were Christians; none of them were Jews. This is too short. We know that the disciples at that time carried two statuses. On the one hand, they were the remnant of Israel, and on the other hand, they were the initiators of the church. We cannot say that they were all Jews. Neither can we say that they were all the church. Those who advocate the entire church's being raptured before the tribulation negate everything; they say that no disciple was a Christian, and that all of them were Jews. Those who advocate the entire church passing through the tribulation apparently admit everything; they say that all the disciples were Christians, and none of them were Jews. But the Bible tells us they were Jews as well as Christians. If all the disciples were Christians, while none of them were Jews, we would have problems with several verses. For example, Matthew 10:5-6 says, "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans. But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." This is a clear reference to their Jewish background. They were men in the transition period. We cannot dogmatically cut them apart and say that at a certain point they were no longer Jews. Another example is Matthew 23:2: "Seated themselves in Moses' seat." Is this verse for the Christian? Of course not. It is for the Jews. In the four Gospels, the Lord was, on the one hand, full of grace, but was, on the other hand, a Jew. Therefore, we cannot say that the disciples were all Jews. Neither can we say that all the disciples were not Jews.</P><P>(3) Those who hold the concept that the entire church will be raptured say that the whole of Matthew 24:23-31 is speaking to the Christians. But we ought to know that Matthew 24 is a continuation of chapter twenty-three, which says that the descendants of the Jews should all bear the responsibility of shedding the blood of the prophets. The Lord said, "Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city" (Matt. 23:34). It is evident that in the future there will still be men sent by the Lord in the land of Judea. During the great tribulation there will be prophets witnessing among the Jews. These people are Christians, yet they are also Jews; they are Jews, and yet they are also Christians. Our friends say there is only the church of Christ. They do not admit that there is a place for the Jews in Matthew 24. But in this chapter many verses refer to the Jewish believers during the tribulation, for many of them will be saved during the great tribulation.</P><P>(4) They make little distinction between the matter of Christ taking the saints and the matter of Christ coming with the saints. To them the phrase, "The Lord comes for the saints," is the same as, "The Lord comes with the saints." They say that the rapture is an open matter and not a secret. But Jude 14 says, "And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied also of these, saying, Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His saints." This refers to the Lord setting foot on the Mount of Olives. In Revelation 1:7 it says "Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him." This too refers to the time of His setting foot on the Mount of Olives. They do not distinguish between these matters. This, again, is their mistake.</P><P>(5) Most of them belong to the historical school of interpretation of the book of Revelation. In the interpretation of the book of Revelation, there are two major schools, the historical school and the futuristic school. Since they are mostly of the historical school, they say that most of Revelation 4-9 has been fulfilled. The futuristic school says that nothing after chapter four has been fulfilled. Although this theory has its deficiency, in general it is correct. According to the Bible, the concept of the historical school is unacceptable because they make inferences about many of the symbols in Revelation. Many interpretations of historical fulfillments are too far-fetched. The church has a history of two thousand years, but Revelation 2-3 has already covered two thousand years. If the book of Revelation is all history, then it can only be for doctors and scholars; you and I would not be able to understand it. They treat nearly every literal record as a symbol. The blood should just be the blood; the fire should just be the fire. But they say that the blood signifies one thing, and the fire signifies another. In addition, they say that the 1,260 days signifies one thing, and "a time and times and half a time" signifies another. They say the sun, the moon, and the stars also refer to something. In this way of thinking, nearly everything becomes a symbol. We would ask one question, does the New Testament fulfill the Old Testament symbolically or literally? We know it fulfills the Old Testament literally. Bethlehem is Bethlehem, and a virgin is a virgin. For example, "Behold, your King is coming to you...mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden" are all matters fulfilled literally. Their teachings of the symbols are utterly illusory. Because they follow the historical school, they treat the entire book of Revelation in the way of symbols. This also is a big mistake.</P><P>I have mentioned just a few examples. I hope we will all see that the Bible says that the church will pass through the tribulation. The Bible, however, does not say that the entire church will pass through the tribulation. If we say that the entire church will pass through the tribulation, we do not have enough evidence from the Bible to back this up. We should remember clearly that the Bible does not say that the entire church will not pass through the tribulation; neither does the Bible say that the entire church will pass through the tribulation. These are all men's erroneous interpretations and not what the Bible says.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RAPTURE AND THE TRIBULATION</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 1, The Christian, Resumed</H2><P>In the first two messages I spoke about those who advocate the belief that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation, and I pointed out the lack of an adequate reason and biblical basis in their arguments. In the last message I spoke about those who advocate the belief that the whole church will go through the tribulation and showed that even though their arguments are more biblically based, they are not without flaws. In this message we will consider whether the Bible teaches that the whole church will go through the tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BIBLICAL PROMISES CONCERNING NOT PASSING THROUGH THE TRIBULATION</H2><P>It is a fact that saints will have to go through the tribulation, and there are biblical proofs for it. However, the Bible never says that the whole church will have to pass through the tribulation. On the contrary, it says that some will not pass through the tribulation. Let us consider the following verses.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The First Promise</H2><P>Revelation 3:10 says, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth."</P><P>First of all, we have to decide on one thing, what is the time referred to by "the hour...which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth." Every reader would agree that this is the time of the great tribulation. This verse says that there are some people who will be kept out of the hour of trial. This verse shows both the unreasonableness of those who advocate the whole church being spared from the tribulation as well as the unreasonableness of those who advocate the whole church will go through the tribulation. This verse shows us that a group of people, those who have "kept the word of My endurance," will be kept from the great tribulation. This verse is a problem to those who believe that the whole church will go through the tribulation; it is hard for them to bypass this verse. At the same time, this verse also shuts the mouths of those who believe that the whole church will be spared from the tribulation.</P><P>This verse was given to the church in Philadelphia. The church in Philadelphia was a very good church at that time in Asia Minor. Although the seven churches in Asia Minor signify the seven stages that the church goes through, they were, nevertheless, seven actual local churches at that time. When the apostle John wrote Revelation, this promise was not given to the six other churches. It was given only to the church in Philadelphia. This shows that this promise was not given without restrictions. Although the Lord promised Thyatira that it would receive the "morning star," which appears to be a promise of the rapture, the only explicit promise of the rapture is given to the church in Philadelphia alone. If the promise of the rapture had been given to all seven churches, it would mean that it was given to the whole church. Since it was not given to all the churches but only to the church in Philadelphia, this shows that the rapture is conditional. The rapture is not based on our status as children of God, nor on salvation and eternal life; rather, the promise of the rapture was given only to those like the church in Philadelphia. Therefore, in order to be raptured, there are conditions which have to be met besides being saved and having eternal life.</P><P>What is the meaning of the expression, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance"? The word of endurance is not any ordinary kind of endurance; it is the word of "My endurance." It is not a common endurance but an endurance that has to do with Christ. Christ endures patiently for the day of His reigning to come. He is not anxious today, and He does not seem to mind others' persecutions and opposition. When a person opposes Him today, He does not get revenge by sending bolts of lightning. He has not stood up to speak for His own right or position; He is waiting for God to make His enemy His footstool. This is the endurance of Christ.</P><P>Today we endure with Him. When John wrote to the seven churches, there was such a word in his introduction: "Fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus." There are three things that one partakes of in this sentence: tribulation, kingdom, and endurance. If a Christian partakes of the tribulation and the endurance on earth today, he will partake also of the kingdom.</P><P>Only those who keep the word of the endurance of Christ will be kept from the hour of trial. If anyone says that the whole church will be kept from the hour of trial, I have to ask, has the whole church kept the word of His endurance? All those who have some position in society, some money in the world, and some activities in the political realm have not kept the word of Christ's endurance. Those who want a name for themselves who want to fight for their rights, and who want to gain something for themselves are not keeping the word of Christ's endurance. The promise of the rapture is not for this kind of people.</P><P>Christ is now waiting for His kingdom to come. He is also calling His believers to wait with Him and endure with Him. While we are on earth, we should renounce all our legal rights and endure men's despising and opposition. The position of a Christian in the world should be the same as the position Christ took when He was on earth. This is to keep the word of the endurance of Christ. The Lord will keep such persons out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.</P><P>Those who advocate the belief that the whole church will go through the tribulation say that keeping does not refer to the rapture but to a deliverance from the tribulation only; it is merely a preservation from falling away. For example, if this house is on fire today, and the kitchen is preserved while the rest of the house is burned to ashes, one can only say that God has provided a place in the house that keeps a person from the fire while the rest of the house is burning; God has not kept him away from the house. These ones say that to be kept from the hour of trial means to be preserved by God in the midst of the great tribulation; it does not mean to be taken away from the tribulation.</P><P>We have to notice that the Greek text here does not mean that one is preserved in the midst of the tribulation, but that one is kept away from the tribulation. It is like the word church, which means to be called out, and those in the church are the called-out ones. The original meaning of the expression "keep you out of the hour of trial" means to be brought out. It means literally to be delivered from. It is not to be preserved in the midst of the tribulation but to be brought out so that one does not have to go through the tribulation.</P><P>According to the direct translation of this verse, is the Lord Jesus promising the church in Philadelphia that they would be kept from the trial or from the hour of trial? It is not from the trial but from the hour of trial. For example, last year on January 28 there was war in Shanghai. This was like the tribulation. At that time some of our brothers were living in Jia-pei. Although the bombers, bombs, and tracers all flew over them, thank the Lord, they were preserved. This means that God had saved them from the trial. Some other brothers who were also living in Jia-pei moved away the first day the fighting started on January 28 to Southeast Asia. They were delivered from the danger of that day. In this case God had saved them from the hour of trial. There is a great difference between being kept from the trial and being kept from the hour of trial. Those who are kept from the trial need not leave the place of trial; they only need to be kept from the trial. But those who are kept from the hour of trial are kept from seeing the trial at all; as such, they must be delivered completely from the scene of the trial. Since such ones are delivered from the time of the trial, they must also be delivered from the place of the trial. A man can be preserved in the midst of the trial, but he can never be kept from the hour of the trial and still go through the trial.</P><P>Some have said that to be preserved from the trial is like the Israelites in the land of Goshen in Egypt; when God punished the Egyptians, the Israelites were preserved by God. But the Bible (Rev. 3:10) says that they will not even see that hour. If the Bible only says that they are kept from the trial, there will still be the possibility for them to go through the tribulation; they can still pass through the tribulation and be preserved by God in the midst of it. But the Bible says that they are kept from the hour of trial. They will not even meet the hour. How then can they pass through the tribulation? Therefore, our friends' argument cannot stand that being kept means to be preserved from falling and being hurt.</P><P>How can one be kept from the hour of trial? There are only two ways: one is by death and the other is by being raptured. Once a man dies, the tribulation will not come to him. Once a man is raptured, the tribulation also will not come to him. Which kind of preserving is the one spoken of here? It is the rapture. If a believer is living today, is God going to preserve him by sending him to death? He will not. Although Revelation 3:10 does not mention the rapture explicitly, nevertheless, it clearly hints at the rapture. From this verse we can see that the rapture does not all take place before the tribulation nor all after the tribulation. Those who keep the word of Christ's endurance will be kept by the Lord from the hour of trial. The Lord has opened up such a way for us.</P><P>The believers' condition on earth today should not be different from that of Christ in heaven today. This is the time of Christ's endurance, and believers should endure the same on earth today as Christ endured when He was on the earth. If they do this, they are qualified to be raptured.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Second Promise</H2><P>Luke 21:36 says, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man."</P><P>This verse clearly says that we will not see the whole church going through the tribulation. If we want to understand the teaching of Luke 21:36, we have to know what Luke 21 is about. Both Luke 21 and Matthew 24 are prophecies concerning future events. Luke emphasizes the destruction of Jerusalem. Although Matthew also mentions the destruction of Jerusalem, its emphasis is on the coming of the Lord. Jerusalem was destroyed by the Roman prince, Titus, in A.D. 70. Luke not only mentions the destruction of Jerusalem at that time, but specifically says that during the great tribulation, Jerusalem will be trodden by the Gentiles. The prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem will see its complete fulfillment in the future. The destruction in A.D. 70 was only a foretaste for the Jews. Luke refers to the time of Titus, on the one hand, and to the time of the great tribulation, on the other hand. On the one hand, it speaks of what the Jews would suffer under the hand of Titus the prince. On the other hand, it speaks of what they will suffer under the hand of Antichrist at the time of the great tribulation. Therefore, Matthew pays attention to the rapture and the judgment, whereas Luke pays attention to the great tribulation.</P><P>In Matthew 24:3 the disciples asked the Lord three questions: (1) "When will these things be?" This means the time when Jerusalem will be destroyed. (2) "What will be the sign of Your coming?" and (3) "What will be the sign...of the consummation of the age?" Luke 21:7 only says, "When therefore will these things be? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?" In Luke the Lord was not asked concerning His coming and the consummation of the age. This shows that there is a difference of emphasis for Matthew and Luke. Matthew emphasizes the Lord's coming, whereas Luke emphasizes the coming great tribulation. Luke shows us what the tribulation will be like. It shows us what the tribulation would be like at the time of Titus and the condition of the coming great tribulation. Luke 21:8-16 speaks about the events that will take place before the end, verses 17-19 speak about the suffering those ones will experience, and verses 20-28 include the two destructions of Jerusalem, one at the time of Titus and the other at the time of the great tribulation.</P><P>We can see that this passage seems to tell us that all Christians will have to pass through the tribulation, because it says that while Jerusalem will experience such and such, they will still be there. They will see the situation, which means that they will be there. "And when these things begin to happen, stand erect and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near" (v. 28). This seems to indicate that Christians will be there. In verses 29-33, the Lord seems to be guaranteeing that such events will surely occur. If the words stopped at verse 33, no Christian would be raptured, and everyone would have to go through the tribulation. However, after verse 33, the Lord changes His tone. Before this verse, the Lord seems to indicate that everyone has to go through the tribulation. But from verses 34 to 36, He changes His tone; it seems that the restriction has been relaxed.</P><P>Verses 34 and 35 say, "But take heed to yourselves lest perhaps your hearts be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day come upon you suddenly as a snare. For it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth." Is there a way out? There is! Verse 36 says, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man." This is the way prepared for us by the Lord; it is the rapture (we will prove this later). Luke 21 shows us the two destructions of Jerusalem and what Christians will go through. But Luke also tells us of a way out. If all the Christians will be raptured, there would be no need for verse 34. On the other hand, if all the Christians will have to pass through the tribulation, verse 36 would not be fulfilled. Therefore, from verses 34 through 36, we see that the rapture is conditional; only those who are watchful at every time and are beseeching will be raptured.</P><P>How can we escape the coming great tribulation? There are only two ways: one is by death and the other is by being raptured. Does the Lord promise that we would escape the coming things by death? No, it is not by death. The Lord promised that we would be able to "stand before the Son of Man." To stand in the original language is "to be placed." We cannot stand before the Son of Man; we are placed there. What is this if it is not the rapture? Surely this refers to the rapture. Death is not a blessing. Is Luke 21:36 telling us to hope for death? Surely it is not.</P><P>Those friends who advocate the belief that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation come into conflict with the words of Luke 21:20-28 because clearly this passage describes the scene of going through the tribulation. But because there is verse 36, we cannot say that the whole church will go through the tribulation; those who practice verse 36 will be raptured before the tribulation. Can we say that all the Christians are watching at every time and beseeching? One older Christian said that every Christian has the work of verse 36 because he has believed in the Lord Jesus and is surely watching and beseeching. But the word of the Bible is specific here. Among all the saved ones, only those who have the work of verse 36 can be placed before the Lord. Moreover, the "watchful at every time, beseeching" does not refer to daily praying and beseechings that we have. In the original language, this expression qualifies what is described afterwards. After the word beseeching there should be a colon. This means that one watches at every time and beseeches by saying, "Lord, deliver me from what is coming, which is the great tribulation." Watching at every time and beseeching does not refer to ordinary watching and beseeching, but to watching and beseeching for deliverance from the coming tribulation.</P><P>Many brothers and sisters have prayed for their daily living, parents, children, and own spirituality. But have they prayed for this matter before? If we do not believe that the world is evil, how can we pray for deliverance from the world? Who would pray for deliverance from sin when his heart loves sin? Who would not want to strike a fortune when his heart is for money? Beseeching God to deliver us from these things is to acknowledge that all these things are vanity and that the coming tribulation is a fact. This is why there is the prayer, "God, save me from the coming tribulation." May we all have such a prayer.</P><P>"Stand before the Son of Man." According to the original language, this phrase can be translated "be made worthy to be placed before the Son of Man." Therefore, it is not a question of grace but a question of work. Whether or not one will be raptured is a question of worthiness. If you are a person who is watching at every time and beseeching, God will consider you worthy of being placed before the Son of Man; you will be considered worthy of being raptured. What is it to be worthy? God cannot take you to a place where you do not want to go. Many people do not want to go to heaven. Heaven would be a place of suffering to them. In heaven one will have to pray, read the Bible, and sing forever. How tiring that will be! In heaven there will not be all the amusements. How dull that will be! Many people are not spiritual and heavenly enough to be raptured to heaven. There is a fable that says that an eagle once found a cat and told him how wonderful the sky is and how wonderful the sun, moon, and snow on the mountaintop are. The cat said, "I only ask one thing: `Are there mice in the sky?'" If there were no mice, nothing would be attractive to the cat. If all that a Christian thinks about is children, money, position, and fame, he would have no interest in heaven. If he is not zealous for the Lord, and finds all the heavenly things dull, he cannot blame God for not being gracious to him, for he will have no heart for heaven and will not want it.</P><P>Last summer a brother was preaching that the whole church would be raptured before the tribulation. I asked him, "Are there saved Christians who watch movies?" He said yes. I then asked, "Are there saved Christians who commit fornication?" He said yes again. I then asked, "Suppose when the Lord comes back, these ones are watching movies or committing fornication. Will they be raptured?" If they will be raptured, what kind of doctrine is this? The Lord said that these kind of people are not worthy to be raptured. Being raptured is a matter of being worthy. If we hold onto the things of the earth, God will not take us away against our will. For example, a helium balloon goes up by itself, but if a piece of stone is tied to it, it will not ascend. Therefore, the rapture does not depend on whether or not one has life but on whether or not one's heart is free from the world. The Lord says, "Lest perhaps your hearts be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and the anxieties of life" (v. 34). It is a question of the things that are holding down one's heart.</P><P>Verse 36 shows us clearly that the whole church will neither escape the tribulation, nor go through the tribulation. The Lord gives us a promise here: whoever is watching at every time and beseeching will be raptured. If no one will pass through the tribulation, there would be no need for this verse. If everyone will pass through the tribulation, this verse will not be fulfilled. It is because of the possibility of a rapture before the tribulation that there is such a promise from the Lord. Otherwise, of what use is this verse?</P><P>Our friends say that "all these things which are about to happen" (v. 36) does not refer to the great tribulation but to the debauchery, drunkenness, and anxieties of life mentioned in verse 34. They say that as long as a Christian can watch at every time and beseech, God will deliver him from such things as debauchery and drunkenness. But they leave out the words "which are about to happen." Are the things in verse 34 things that are here today, or are they things that are about to happen? The debauchery, drunkenness, and anxieties of life are all things of today. They are things that people need to be delivered from today. How can one wait until the future to be delivered from them? Furthermore, the deliverance from these things is not a matter of worthiness; a person should be delivered from these things in any case as long as they are here. Therefore, "all these things which are about to happen" in verse 36 refers to the great tribulation. These things which are about to happen are not here today. From this verse, we can see that the theory of the whole church passing through the tribulation is unfounded, for the Lord clearly promises "that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen." I will only mention these two major proofs. At least in Revelation 3:10 and Luke 21:36, the Bible shows us that some saints will not pass through the tribulation. The verses we read in the last message say that saints will pass through the tribulation, whereas the verses we read in this message say that there is a way out. Generally speaking, the church will pass through the tribulation. But the verses we read today say that a minority of believers will be raptured before the tribulation. If we read Matthew 25 carefully, we will see that the five prudent virgins are believers, and the five foolish virgins are also believers. Those who are raptured are believers, and those who are left behind are also believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MISCELLANEOUS PROOFS</H2><P>Without the way out mentioned in Luke 21:36, it would be impossible to understand many passages of the Bible. The rapture is a hidden thing, because the Bible says that the Lord will come as a thief (Matt. 24:43; 1 Thes. 5:4). This means that the Lord's coming is hidden and is not open. But then, on the other hand, the Bible says that we should not let the day come upon us as a thief, which means that the Lord's coming is open. On the one hand, it is hidden, and on the other hand, it is open. How can we explain this if there are not two comings of the Lord? How can we reconcile these two groups of Scriptures unless a small number of believers are raptured before the tribulation and the majority of them are raptured after the tribulation?</P><P>In addition to these verses, Revelation 12:5 speaks of being caught up to the throne of God. Revelation 14:3 says that these ones are before the throne. Luke 21:36 says that they will be placed before the Son of Man. All these refer to a rapture to heaven. But there are also other verses that speak of being raptured to the air. For example, 1 Thessalonians 4:17 says "to meet the Lord in the air," and Matthew 25:10 says, "The bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast." This also happens in the air. The harvest in Revelation 14:14-16 also takes place in the air. If the rapture all takes place before the tribulation, or all after the tribulation, how can these two groups of verses be explained? Therefore, it is indeed a biblical teaching to say that a minority of the believers will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas the majority of them will be raptured after the tribulation. Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain many verses.</P><P>Moreover, the Bible says that no one knows the day of the coming of Christ. But at the same time, the Bible also says that the day of the coming of Christ can be known. On the one hand, it says that Christ will come at the sounding of the seventh trumpet, at the blowing of the last trumpet. On the other hand, it says, "concerning that day and hour, no one knows" (Matt. 24:36) and "at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming" (v. 44). If there is only one rapture, how can you not know His coming? Since the Bible has said that He will come at the blowing of the seventh trumpet, you can find out the time of Christ's coming by counting three and a half years from the time Antichrist begins sitting in Jerusalem. Why then does the Bible say that concerning that day and hour, no one knows? This means that some will be raptured before the tribulation, because no one knows the time of the rapture before the tribulation. But anyone can find out the time of the rapture after the tribulation. I dare not say that there are only two raptures. But I can say that according to the Bible, there is such a distinction in the rapture. On the one hand, it cannot be known, but on the other hand, it can be known. On the one hand, it is hidden, but on the other hand, it is open. On the one hand, men cannot see it, but on the other hand, many can see it. If we have any prejudice, it will be impossible for us to interpret these verses.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWERS TO THOSE PROPOSING<br>THE PRE-TRIBULATION RAPTURE<br>AND THOSE PROPOSING<br>THE POST-TRIBULATION RAPTURE</H2><P>Those who oppose having different kinds of raptures have their reasons also. But let us consider if their reasons are valid.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The First Answer</H2><P>Our friends say that the rapture of the church cannot be divided into separate times; there can be only one rapture because the church is the Body of Christ, and if there is more than one rapture, it would be divided up into pieces. How can the Body of Christ be divided up?</P><P>However, we know that the Body of Christ is a metaphorical expression. Its main significance is that there is only one life. It does not mean that this Body is physically connected together like our physical body. If it means that, then the Body of Christ is divided today. Christ the Head is in heaven, while we the Body are on earth. Does this not mean that there is already a division? Some believers have died. Does this not also mean a division? Some believers have not been born. Does this not also mean a division? If the difference in the time of rapture will divide the Body of Christ, these separations that we have mentioned have already divided the Body of Christ. Can such an argument be valid?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Second Answer</H2><P>Our friends argue that the rapture is a part of redemption. Romans 8:23 says, "Eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body." If it is part of redemption, then it is grace. If the redemption of the body is by grace, then there should not be one group being raptured first and another group left behind.</P><P>However, please remember that the rapture is not the redemption of the body; it is something apart from the redemption of the body. The rapture has to do with God's grace. In fact, everything is a matter of grace. Yet the rapture is with a condition. There are only two books that speak about the position of the church. They are Colossians and Ephesians. In these two books the highest point the church has attained is death, resurrection, and ascension. Is the rapture mentioned? No, it is not mentioned. Before the rapture, there is the need for transfiguration. Resurrection is a grace of God, but the rapture is not. It is significant that Colossians and Ephesians do not mention the rapture. Do the four Gospels mention the rapture as a grace? No, they do not.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Third Answer</H2><P>One brother said, "If, as you said, some will be raptured before the tribulation whereas others will be raptured after it, will not the church lose its hope for the rapture this way? It is most cruel to say, as you have advocated, that a minority will be raptured first, while the majority will be left behind to pass through the tribulation before they will be raptured."</P><P>My answer is that the hope of the whole church's being raptured before the tribulation is an empty hope in any case, because the Bible never says that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation. Since this is a vain hope anyway, it is better that we tell people about it. In this way they will know that the rapture is not based on their salvation in life, but on the scriptural works that they perform after they have received such a life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Fourth Answer</H2><P>Our friends quote 1 Corinthians 15:23, which says, "But each one in his own order: the firstfruits, Christ; then those who are Christ's at His coming." Here it only mentions "those who are Christ's" without making any further distinction; it does not say how a person's work should be after salvation, and it does not say anything about watching and beseeching.</P><P>What they say is true for this passage, but they cannot add other things to the passage. For example, there is a law in China which says, "Every Chinese citizen has his right as a citizen of China." But as soon as a citizen of China breaks some law, he will lose his right as a citizen. Can he argue that he still has a right based on the clause, "Every Chinese citizen has his right as a citizen of China"? Of course, he cannot. John 3 says that those who are born again can enter the kingdom of God. But there are many other Scriptures that tell us that those who have been regenerated and have eternal life may not necessarily receive the kingdom.</P><P>Moreover, 1 Corinthians 15 is not on the rapture but on resurrection. From the first verse until the last verse, it is on resurrection. The rapture is something that men put into their reading. It is true that the resurrection of a Christian is based on the fact that he belongs to Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Fifth Answer</H2><P>Our friends ask that if this is the case, what will happen to those believers who are dead? If those Christians who do not do well will have to pass through the tribulation and will suffer more, what will happen to those Christians who have not done so well and have died? Does this mean that they will not have to pass through the tribulation? If that is the case, does it not mean that they will come off better than the first group?</P><P>My answer is that we do not have to worry about this. God will never be unjust. As Abraham said, "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (Gen. 18:25). This is not our business but God's business. At the same time, it seems that this group of people will indeed suffer something. Perhaps they will not go through the tribulation, but they will have to stand before the judgment seat and will receive their recompense, because 2 Corinthians 5:10 says, "For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad." This has nothing to do with salvation or perdition, but it has to do with the kingdom. The entrance of the kingdom is something decided by us ourselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Sixth Answer</H2><P>Our friends quote 1 Corinthians 15:51, which says, "We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed." Does not the word "all" denote that there will be only one rapture? One brother said that the Bible only distinguishes the wheat from the tares but does not distinguish the wheat from other wheat. As such is the case, there is only one rapture.</P><P>It is true that there is the distinction between the wheat and the tares. But there is also the distinction between one kind of wheat and another kind of wheat. Leviticus 23 is one example of it. First there is the firstfruit, and then there is the general harvest, and finally there are the gleanings. Not only does Leviticus say this; Revelation 14 has this distinction also. First there is the firstfruit, and then there is the general harvest.</P><P>I also believe that we all will be changed. But the Bible is limited to saying that we all will be changed; it does not say that we all will be raptured at the same time. Moreover, 1 Corinthians 15 is on resurrection; it is not on the rapture. I admit that 1 Corinthians 15 runs parallel to 1 Thessalonians 4, but the emphasis in 1 Corinthians 15 is different. It is true that we will all be changed. But the Bible does not say that we will all be raptured at the same time. Why should we add on something that the Bible has not said?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Seventh Answer</H2><P>First Thessalonians 4:15 says, "For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep."</P><P>This is a strong reason to these ones. They ask if 1 Thessalonians 4:15 is on the rapture. Yes, it is. But what does this verse say? It says that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep. If one group of people will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas most of the people will be raptured at the sounding of the seventh trumpet (at which time the dead will be resurrected), does this not mean that those who are living will precede those who have fallen asleep? First Thessalonians 4 says that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep. This shows that our rapture will not be before the resurrection of the dead. How then can one say that there will be a group who will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas the rest of the people, including the dead ones, will be raptured after the tribulation?</P><P>This verse is comparatively a more reasonable proof among all the verses these ones have quoted. They say that the rapture of the living cannot precede those who have died. However, my Bible says "who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep." Not only does verse 15 have the words "living, who are left remaining"; verse 17 has the same words. We should not misread these words. Does not "living" mean that these are in the world? Why is there the need to say "who are left remaining" again? If to be "living" is to be alive, and to be "left remaining" is also to be alive, why is there the repetition? The New Testament does not have such repetition for no reason. What then do the words "living, who are left remaining" refer to? The group who are "living, who are left remaining" includes fewer than those who are merely "living." Saying "living" refers only to the believers who are living. But "living, who are left remaining" refers not to all the living believers, but to those who are (1) living and (2) remaining. Therefore, to be "living, who are left remaining" means that another group who is living have been taken away, while this group is not only living but is left remaining. The group which is left behind are the "living, who are left remaining." Being living is versus being dead, while being left remaining is versus being taken away. The "living, who are left remaining" is versus the living who have been taken (raptured). What does it mean to remain? It means that another group has left first. For example, if ten guests are invited, and if we ask how many guests are here, and the answer comes that ten came but that only five are left remaining, this means that the other five have left. Does this not hint that one group has left?</P><P>Our friends ask, "Would this not mean that even Paul has become the second group?" My answer is that Paul did not go on living and was not left remaining anyway. The word "we" that he used does not refer to any persons in particular; it is only a way of expression. It can be compared to the way, in preaching the gospel, when we say that "we" have committed this and that kind of sins. This does not mean that we ourselves have indeed committed this or that kind of sins. Likewise, when Paul mentioned "we," he did not mean to put himself as one of those who will be left behind. It is merely a way of expression.</P><P>Brothers, in making such discernments on these verses, we can see that the proposal that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation is a vain theory; it is an assumption and does not have any basis in the Scriptures. Those who say that the church will go through the tribulation have more of a basis in the facts. However, it is equally wrong to say that the whole church will pass through the tribulation. The Bible says that only those who keep the Lord's word of endurance and who are watchful at every time and beseeching will be raptured before the tribulation. The rest of the people will be raptured only after the tribulation. This is the teaching of the Bible. At any rate, according to the Bible, a minority will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas the majority will be raptured after the tribulation. As to how many raptures there will be and how the raptures will take place, these are things beyond the scope of this message, and we will not delve into them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCLUSION</H2><P>If we are prepared, we will be raptured. If we are not prepared, we will pass through these many tribulations. Therefore, there is only one thing that is sure: either we have to pass through death today, which means that we have to take the way of death, dying to the self-life and the world, so that we can be raptured, or we will have to wait for that day to pass through death. We have to taste death anyway. During these two weeks, I have had the feeling that many believers will pass through the tribulation and will see the Antichrist. But at that time the Holy Spirit will come in double measure. By that time, tongues, prophecies, and miraculous gifts will increase and will become more prevalent than at Pentecost. Therefore, if a person is unfortunately left behind, he has to be strengthened and stand fast. By that time, everyone will have to face the Antichrist. At the same time, every one of us will have to pass through sufferings that no human being can endure. But at that time, we will endure them. If we can be raptured ahead of time, we will praise the Lord for it. If, unfortunately, we are left behind, there is nothing to do but to fight the Antichrist. All of us have to be prepared to fight, sacrifice our life, and engage him in the final struggle in an unrelenting way, until we die.</P><P>Let me say a few more words. Some take the attitude that as long as they are saved, they are satisfied and they would not be bothered about anything more. They do not aspire to be anything, and they do not want to think about what will happen in the future. But I must tell you that by that time, no one will say that he does not want to think about it, because everyone will be forced to think about it. If we are not prepared, and if we are not ready to offer up everything to God, we will not be raptured but will instead be left behind. By that time, if we are Christians and are still around, we will not be able to get by. It may be that those who are not yet born will be more blessed. But those who are born will surely have to go through these things. May we be those who are watchful and prepared.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FORGIVENESS AND CONFESSION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FORGIVENESS BEING OUT OF GOD</H2><P>Forgiveness is something according to God's heart. God loves man, and He loves to forgive man's sins. Therefore, from the time man sinned, God sought ways to redeem man from his sins.</P><P>In the Old Testament God used the blood of bulls and goats to redeem man from his sins. In the New Testament He appointed the Lord Jesus, who is the Lamb of God, to be the sacrifice for sin. In offering up Himself, man is forever redeemed from his sins. On God's side, the blood shed on the cross by the Lord Jesus has completely solved the problem of man's sin. But on man's side, there is another condition-faith. Whoever believes that the blood of the Lord Jesus is shed for his sins is redeemed, and his sins are forgiven. Whoever does not believe will perish and his destiny will be hell. However, the work of redemption is complete, and it is of God. It was initiated by God, a work that God wanted to do. God has done this work; He has sacrificed His only begotten Beloved and paid such a price. Therefore, there is no problem to prevent God from forgiving man's sin to redeem man from his sins. O sinners, are you still fearful that your sins will not be taken care of? Are you still afraid that your sins will not be forgiven? God will forgive you; He is willing to forgive you, and He has paid a great price to forgive you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD BEING ABLE TO FORGIVE MAN'S SINS</H2><P>As soon as a sinner believes that the blood of the Lord Jesus was shed on the cross for his sins, his sins are forgiven. If a believer is by chance overcome by sin, he only needs to repent sincerely and confess his sins before God (1 John 1:9). Such confession will bring about forgiveness. The worth of the Lord Jesus' blood is so great that all of man's sins can be forgiven and he can be cleansed from all unrighteousness. Therefore, there is a way to take care of sins, both in the sinners as well as in the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD FOREVER FORGIVING MAN'S SINS</H2><P>Once the Lord Jesus told Peter to forgive others seventy times seven times. This means that one should continually and forever forgive. As long as a person turns and repents, his sins will be forgiven. Since the Lord taught Peter such a word of grace, is it possible that He would not practice it Himself? This is impossible; He will forgive a sorrowful and repentant sinner, and He will forgive him every time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S FORGIVENESS LEAVING NO TRACE</H2><P>Many people think that committing a sin is like copying a wrong letter, whereas being forgiven of sin is like the erasure of that wrong letter which still leaves an indelible mark on the page. They do not realize that this does not match the fact of God's forgiveness. The blood of the Lord Jesus cleanses man from his sins. What is the meaning of cleansing? It means to be washed to the extent that no trace of blemish or spot is left; it is as if the person had never sinned and is as holy as Christ. Isaiah 1:18 says, "Come now and let us reason together,/Says Jehovah./Though your sins are like scarlet,/They will be as white as snow;/Though they are as red as crimson,/They will be like wool." Snow and wool do not have a speck of red in them. Therefore, when God washes man of his sins, he becomes absolutely clean, and no trace of sin is left.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S HEART OF FORGIVENESS BEING MORE THAN<br>OUR DESIRE FOR FORGIVENESS</H2><P>The actions of the prodigal son's father in Luke 15 show us the forgiving heart of our heavenly Father. While the prodigal son was on his way home, the father saw him and went out to meet him. The old man was not walking slowly but was running toward the son. The father was eager to see his son, and he considered walking to be too slow. As a result, he ran. God's "feet" of forgiveness toward a repentant sinner are also swift. He only wishes He could forgive man of his sins sooner. Did the prodigal son run to his father? No, he did not run. In the movement of the two persons, we see that the forgiving heart of the father was greater than the desire for forgiveness in the son. As we read on, the father's kiss and his embraces tell us that God is most pleased and happy with a sinner who turns back. The son was still remorseful about his past sins and felt that he had sinned against heaven and against his father, but as he was confessing to his father, the father could not contain himself out of his earnest love for the son. He could not wait and did not wait for the son to finish his words. (In Luke 15:18-19, there are five phrases of confession, but in verse 21 only four phrases were spoken; the last one was interrupted by the father.) The father ordered the servants to bring in the best robe and the ring and put them on the son. Oh, our heavenly Father's forgiving heart is greater than our desire for forgiveness. We do not have to weep for three days and three nights, confessing our sins over and over again before we can be forgiven. Many times we confess our sins over and over; we weep again and again, thinking that we can only be forgiven if we buffet ourselves once again. Oh, we have misunderstood God's heart; we have caused His heart pain. We have to realize that He loves those whom He has purchased even more than we love ourselves. He is most eager to forgive us; He "runs" to forgive us. He does not wait for us to finish our confession before He has already forgiven us!</P><P>Many times in our homes the ones we love offend us. Do we not eagerly wait to forgive them? If they apologize a little from their heart and say a little word of apology, do we not forgive them right away? Wherever there is love, there is a forgiving heart. If this is true with earthly relationships, how much more is it true with the Father in heaven, who is full of love and mercy? Will He not eternally and completely forgive man of his sins?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD BEING OBLIGATED TO FORGIVE</H2><P>God sent the Lord Jesus to the world. He shed His blood for man's sins on the cross, and He dealt with man's sins. All these are an expression of God's love. The Lord Jesus has shed His blood; God Himself has testified for Him that whoever believes in Him will be forgiven of their sins. Those who confess their sins will be cleansed. As long as we believe (if we are a sinner) or confess (if we are a believer), God must forgive our sins. If He did not forgive, He would be unfaithful and unrighteous. But I will ask most reverently, "Can the holy God be unfaithful and unrighteous?" Therefore, the matter of forgiveness is securely guaranteed. We should rejoice in God; sin shall not lord it over us any longer. We can be delivered from sin and can be forgiven of our sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S GRACE OF FORGIVENESS<br>LEADING US TO REPENTANCE</H2><P>There are two sides to God's truth. What I have said emphasizes the side of grace. It is true that as long as a man is preserved in the grace of God, he does not have to be concerned about the matter of forgiveness. But if a man thinks that God's grace can be wasted and that he can "continue in sin that grace may abound" (Rom. 6:1), he should pay attention to the following words. These words are severe. The Word says, "Behold then the kindness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but on you, the kindness of God, if you continue in His kindness" (Rom. 11:22).</P><P>Some have said, "I can sin daily by hiding under the blood." Others have said, "I sin in the daytime and confess to God at night, and I am forgiven. The next day I sin again and confess again at night, and I am forgiven again. Since the Lord taught Peter to forgive seventy times seven times, He can surely forgive me. Moreover, 1 John 1:9 says that God is faithful and righteous. He has to forgive my sins, the sins that I have confessed, through the vicarious death of the Lord on the cross."</P><P>Senseless men! We have to realize that God's grace is to lead us to repentance and not to encourage us to sin. If we think that the precious blood can be wasted this way, we have to realize that the blood has never cleansed us from the sins "confessed" in this way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONDITION FOR A CHRISTIAN TO BE FORGIVEN</H2><P>Now we want to answer one question based on the Scriptures. Please read 1 John 1:7: "But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin." This verse shows us one condition and two results. If one condition is met, there will surely be two results. What is this one condition? It is to "walk in the light as He is in the light." If we walk in the light as Christians, we will not be in darkness and will not sin, but we will have works of light rather than works of darkness and sin. But what kind of light are we going to walk in? What, in other words, will this light be according to? In this verse it says that walking in light is "as He is in the light." According to verse 5, "God is light," and in this light there is no darkness at all. All other lights are mixed with darkness. When we walk in this way, we are walking in God's light, and there will be the following two results. First, "we have fellowship with one another." This is our mutual fellowship with all the brothers and sisters in the Lord. If we meet the condition we have mentioned, we can fellowship. If there is no fellowship, it must mean that the condition we have mentioned has been violated. Furthermore, there is a second result, which is that "the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin." This means that when we fulfill the condition of "walking in the light," the blood will be effective in its work of cleansing us from our sins. Now we are clear: fellowship with one another and cleansing of the blood both come from the condition of walking in the light. If a Christian does not walk in the light, he will lose the benefit of fellowship and cleansing. Put another way, in order to have fellowship and to be cleansed from our sins, we have to walk in the light. Otherwise, we cannot fellowship, and there cannot be any cleansing even if we want these things.</P><P>The first result, the fellowship, is visible; it can be experienced on earth and is before men. The second result, the cleansing by the blood, is invisible; it is a fact in heaven and is before God. But just as the visible result on earth is a fact, the invisible result in heaven is also a fact. Just as the part before men is a fact, the part before God is also a fact. Therefore, if you are a believer who has sinned, you will not be able to fellowship naturally with other believers; you will try to avoid other brothers and sisters and will not want to see their faces. I must tell those who are walking in sin and darkness that the minute you lose your fellowship with other believers, the effectiveness of the cleansing of the blood will also be gone before God in heaven. Just as you lose the first result through not walking in the light, you will surely lose the second result. You may confess your sins with your mouth, but the blood will never cleanse you of your sin. This does not mean that the blood has lost its effectiveness in cleansing. Rather, it means that your condition of not walking in the light shows that you have not fulfilled the prerequisite for the blood to cleanse you of your sins. The prerequisite for cleansing is to be walking in the light. But since you continue to sin and walk in darkness, the blood cannot cleanse your sins. The blood can only cleanse the sins of those who walk in the light.</P><P>Therefore, brothers, do not deceive yourselves. If you have sinned and become fallen and have lost the visible fellowship, I am afraid that the blood in the invisible heaven has not cleansed you from your sins either. I must tell you most soberly that unless you thoroughly deal with your sins in sorrow and repentance, you will still have to give an account of your sins before the judgment seat of Christ in the future. Therefore, if there is only the confession with the mouth, without the conduct of walking in the light and without a broken and contrite heart (Psa. 51:17), your sins will not be cleansed.</P><P>Now we want to give special emphasis to this one prerequisite, which is to walk in the light. This prerequisite has been particularly neglected by those who have wasted the blood. (Of course, in reality, the blood can never be wasted by anyone.) Little do they realize that this prerequisite is their only remedy. Therefore, we have to pay more attention to this matter. According to the Bible, whenever a believer has sinned and desires to receive forgiveness, there are at least three conditions that must be met: (1) with respect to the spirit-there must be a broken spirit (Psa. 51:17), (2) with respect to the mouth-one must confess his sin with his mouth (1 John 1:9), and (3) with respect to the walk-one must walk in the light (1 John 1:7). If anyone thinks that by hiding under the blood they can sin every day, or that they can sin in the daytime and have everything taken care of by confessing at night, I will tell them most solemnly that there is not such a thing. God cannot be mocked. Whenever you walk in the darkness, the blood cannot cleanse you from your sin. The blood cannot become your refuge; it cannot become your hiding place. If you want the blood to cleanse you from your sins, you must first walk in the light and not indulge in your sins any longer.</P><P>The true confession must be one that sorrows according to God. This kind of sorrow works a repentance that is without regret. This kind of repentance has seven expressions: (1) earnestness, (2) defense, (3) indignation, (4) fear, (5) longing, (6) zeal, and (7) punishment (2 Cor. 7:11). Only those who have these seven conditions are truly confessing persons. Otherwise, a person's confession with the mouth does not agree with his heart. His mouth may be confessing, but his heart will not hate sin. I say again that the blood will not have any effect on such persons.</P><P>Some commit sins again and again, and they are bound by sin because they know the forgiveness of sin only as a formula; they know the way or method to obtain the forgiveness of sin. They know 1 John 1:9, which says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." They think that the Lord Jesus has already shed His blood for them, and that the blood can now cleanse them from their sins. At the same time, God is both faithful and righteous, and if they confess their sins, God will surely forgive them of all their sins and cleanse them from all unrighteousness. Since they have this "charm" to protect them, they do whatever they want and act loosely, because there is a way to be forgiven in any case. They think that as long as they confess, they can sin a little and everything will be all right, even while they are sinning. These people are in a dangerous place! I heard of one brother opening the letter of another brother. Later he told the second one, "I know that it is wrong to open up others' letters, but I know that you will forgive me. That is why I opened it." This is knowing the way of forgiveness and purposely sinning because of this knowledge. Those who do such things have fallen into Satan's trap. These people are hidden rocks in one's spiritual voyage; they are very dangerous. If someone only knows the method of forgiveness of 1 John 1:9, which is confession, but does not know the prerequisite of verse 7, which is walking in the light, I wish he would be in fear and trembling, so that he would not sin and offend God. Let me say again that the grace of God is to lead him to repentance; it is not to encourage him to sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOUR DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF THE HEART<br>IN A CHRISTIAN'S CONFESSION</H2><P>Even when a person realizes that he has sinned and has confessed his sins to God or to man, the condition of the heart during his confession may be vastly different from one case to another! According to my own observation, there are at least four conditions:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Confession because of the<br>Conscience's Condemnation</H2><P>After a man sins, his conscience is not at peace; it condemns him. After a man confesses his sins, his conscience is at peace and does not condemn him any longer. It is all right to confess one's sins as a result of the condemnation in the conscience. But if one confesses his sins merely for the sake of having peace in his conscience and to stop its condemnation, and if there is no deeper reason than this (the deeper reason being a realization of the evil of sin itself), such a confession is only a bribing of the conscience. The conscience is the organ within that tells him his true condition. The reason the conscience condemns is that sin is evil. This is why it continues to speak to a person. However, a person may find the unceasing condemnation of the conscience a nuisance and try to find a way to stop its condemnation only, neglecting to hate the sin that the conscience hates. In such a case, a person is paying attention only to the condemnation of the conscience; he is not paying attention to the cause of the conscience's condemnation, which is sin. Therefore, he does not hate sin that much. Instead, he only feels the nuisance of the condemnation of his conscience. He does not deal with the root of the matter, which is sin, but only with the condemnation which is a result of the root of sin. In this way, he tries to bribe his conscience by means of confession. But this is not the way that God wants us to deal with our sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Confession because of the<br>Condemnation of Others' Consciences</H2><P>Sometimes you have offended or sinned against others. On the one hand, you feel that you owe them something, and on the other hand, you are afraid that they will hate you in their hearts and remember your offense. In order to stop the conscience of the others from condemning you and to live peaceably with them, you look for an appropriate opportunity to confess to them. As long as you have their forgiveness, you think that you will be reconciled to them, that they will not hate you any longer, and that their conscience will not condemn you. If the others will not forgive you, there will be a problem between them and God, and they will be the ones who will suffer. (Matthew 6:15 says, "But if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses.") This kind of thinking is similar to the first kind, for the attention is not on sin, but on others' conscience. It is true that we have to be reconciled to others. But if we only pay attention to this, without feeling the evil of sin itself, we do not have the kind of condition in our heart that God requires in our dealing with sin.</P><P>If one confesses his sin based on the two conditions we have mentioned, the result will surely be that he will sin easily and confess easily. If the heart does not feel that every sin against man is also a sin against God, if the blood does not seem to be that important, and if he thinks that sins have only to do with man and one only need to deal with man, he will not see the evil of sin nor consider confession as a serious matter. At the same time, if a person does not have a genuine broken and contrite heart, he will not have any difficulty in confession. In short, he will consider sin as something very light and will easily commit sin. Sometimes, even before he makes confession for a sin, he commits the same sin again. May God be gracious so that we can see sin the way He sees it!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Confession through Fear of<br>the Coming Judgment</H2><P>Some remember the word of 2 Corinthians 5:10, which says, "For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad." At the judgment seat, Christ will not only judge their works, but also their conduct. Everything that has not passed through the judgment of the Holy Spirit, through the conscience, and every sin that has not been cleansed away by the blood will be judged by the Lord. Therefore, their hearts are afraid. Since today's sins will have to be dealt with in the future, they consider it wiser if they deal with them today, so that they can be spared from future judgment. It is not bad to confess one's sin under such a condition; it is much better than the above two cases, because the above two cases only relate to man, whereas this, at least, relates to God. One confesses before God, through a fear of God. Such a person may have two kinds of confessions; one is before God, and the other is before men (if such sins are against men also). After he has made a clear confession, he will have a clear conscience before God and men. Although this kind of confession is quite good and proper, it is, nevertheless, not the highest condition God desires the heart to be in for confession.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Confession through Seeing<br>the Filthiness of Sin Itself</H2><P>This is the condition that God wants our heart to be in for our confession. God has put His own life into us. When we have this life, we have the most holy nature, a nature that is as holy as God's. Sin is something very filthy before God; it is absolutely incompatible with the holy life of God. When God gives to us His holy life, He intends that we hate sin in the same way that He hates it. If a man allows God's holy life to grow and if he realizes the filthiness of sin itself, he will say as Madame Guyon did: "I would rather go to hell than to sin." The life of God is within us for the purpose of expressing Christ. The more Christ's nature is expressed, the more we see the evil of sin, and the more we will stay away from it (Heb. 7:26). We will consider sin like leprosy, and the more we stay away from it, the better we will feel. All those who know sin in this way will not easily fall into sin. If a person confesses his sin under this kind of condition, he will surely be a godly and holy man, and he will live before God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW TO HAVE A PROPER REALIZATION OF SIN</H2><P>How can we have such a proper realization of sin? This requires the enlightening of the Holy Spirit, a willingness to obey the light, and a willingness to repudiate the sins that are exposed by the light. The indwelling Holy Spirit operates in our spirit and exposes the true condition of sin before us; it gives understanding to our mind, the Spirit-renewed mind, and causes us to realize in a genuine way that sin is most filthy. At such times, our conscience will rise up to condemn sin as sin, and our new life, the life of Christ, will most naturally reject sin. This rejection is a most spontaneous function of God's nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Let me repeat this in a simple way. The Holy Spirit reveals the true condition of sin to us under the light of life. (Note: John 1:4 says, "The life was the light of men." The life of Christ is the light of man within him. This light is not visible from the outside. If a man pays attention to outward, visible lights, he is in danger of being deceived.) As a result, we obey the light and abhor the sins exposed by the light according to God's nature within this light. The more we obey the light, the brighter the light will shine within us, and the filthier sin will appear, and the more we will hate sin. When a man is under the bright sun, even specks of dust flying in the air, which men do not ordinarily see with their eyes, are exposed. A person who lives in God's light all the time will see things as sin that others do not even consider as sin. (For example, Madame Guyon repented for the good works that she had done, such as giving to the poor, and asked for the cleansing of the Lord's blood over these things because she saw, under God's light, that all her former good works were righteousnesses that originated from her self and were not from God's life. As such, she needed the cleansing.) In this way, one's feeling toward sin will become sensitive, and the measure of holiness (on the practical side) will grow.</P><P>Indeed, just as the nature of an Adamic man (one who is not yet regenerated) is inclined toward sin (the so-called "cherished sins" are the sins that the old nature yearns to commit), the divine nature within a person who belongs to Christ feels a repulsion against sin. This repulsion for sin itself is a spontaneous expression of God's nature within man. Only this condition in our heart is from God and is pleasing to God.</P><P>If we analyze the four kinds of conditions, we will find that the first three kinds have the self as the center and are directly related to one's self-interest. Only the last kind is from God and has God as the center. We should be those who are standing with God only.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONFESSION BEING FIRST TOWARD GOD</H2><P>Among Christians there is a grevious tendency concerning the confession of sins; men gradually shift their attention from dealing with God to dealing with men. Among some Christians, the blood is not even mentioned, and as long as men's consciences are at peace with others, they put God aside. This situation is terrible, and it causes men to lose their fear of God. I will say most solemnly that a confession that does not require the blood is definitely one that is from hell. We have to realize that when man sins, the first one he has offended is God, not man, and the One who is offended the most is God, not man. For example, if someone breaks an object in your house, the one who is offended is you, not the object. David said in Psalms 51:4, "Against You and You alone have I sinned,/And I have done what is evil in Your sight." He did not say that he had sinned against Uriah or Bathsheba. Judas, the betrayer of Jesus, in comparison, confessed his sins and returned his money; he settled everything on man's side, but he was still a son of perdition. This does not mean that we should not confess our sins to one another. It is right for us to confess to each one (James 5:16), but our dealing before God is more important than our dealings before men. We should never reverse the order and allow ourselves to put God and the blood aside. We should not neglect making a clear confession before men, but it is more important to confess our sins thoroughly before God. May God be merciful to us!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE POWER OF RESURRECTION</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 13:33; 1 Cor. 12:13; Eph. 1:16-23</H1><P>We have to consider one matter before God, which is the power of resurrection. This is a great subject, and we cannot cover it fully within this limited space. I only intend to point out the most central principle in resurrection. But I must state again that this cannot be explained clearly in human language, and the human mind cannot comprehend it. Human words and thoughts are useless in understanding resurrection because this matter is beyond human thoughts and words. We can only look to the Lord's Spirit to reveal this matter to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I</H2><P>Even though the creation of man was good and perfect, we must understand that it did not reach God's goal because man did not have God's life. Man's creation was perfect but not complete. When God created all things, they were complete, but when He created man, His purpose was not completed. In one sense man was perfect, and the work of creation was finished. But since the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life were placed before man, we should realize that the purpose of man's creation was not yet complete. The work of creating man was finished; he was a living soul. But he still did not have the life represented by the tree of life. God finished the creation of all things, and in one sense, He also finished the creation of man. But in another sense, man had not yet reached the stage of completion. This is the difference between man and all the other creatures; after all the other creatures were created, there was no need to add anything more to them because God had no other demand on them. But God has a special purpose for man. This is why there was a need to complete another step after man was created. This step required man's initiative; he had to take in the fruit of the tree of life. Unfortunately, man took in the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of the fruit of the tree of life. We must see that man's purpose in creation was not complete; God had not gained man according to His eternal plan. Even if man had not eaten the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, God's heart would still not have been satisfied. In other words, whether or not man ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he was still limited and somewhat short. Even when he reached his highest attainment, he was still short; he had not reached a point of completion that was according to God's eternal plan because he did not have God's life.</P><P>We know that in creating Adam, God collected the dust of the earth and breathed into it the breath of life, making him a living soul. But His purpose was not finished. This was not enough because man did not have God's life. Man only had the created life; he did not have the uncreated life. Man was still bound by time and space. His creation brought him to a certain point, but according to God's plan, he had not reached the stage of completion. Therefore, since the time of Adam, God has been working continuously for the purpose of gaining a man who is fully according to His plan. We see that God worked on man throughout the entire Old Testament from Genesis 3, with Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joshua, Samuel, David, and many others. The purpose of His work was to fulfill His purpose in these men. We see that these men were indeed gained by God, and God indeed completed His work through these men. As far as God's particular purpose for these men was concerned, God gained them. But as far as a man who could fulfill God's eternal purpose, they still came short. These men all stopped at a certain point. Every one of them reached a certain point and stopped. Nevertheless, the highest point that they reached was part of what a man after God's plan should have.</P><P>In the New Testament a man came, who was the Son of God Himself coming to be a man. He was the Word who became flesh. This man was the man that God had been waiting for. Man, according to God's heart, was indeed complete at that time. This man was Jesus Christ. We have to remember that Christ is the man that God has been waiting for throughout all the years. Christ is a completed man, a man who represents God, a typical man.</P><P>But it was not enough for the Lord Jesus to be such a man on earth. Even though He was different from other men on earth because He possessed God's nature and was a perfect man, He was still limited by the human limitations with respect to His power. Time could limit Him, and space could limit Him. When the four men took the paralytic to the Lord Jesus, there were too many people, and they had to remove the roof to let him down before the Lord (Mark 2:3-4). When someone wanted to touch Him, she had to press upon Him before she could touch Him (5:27-31). The Lord commended the great faith of the centurion because he said to the Lord, "Lord, I am not fit for You to enter under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant will be healed." He knew that he did not need to press the Lord and touch Him. He knew the unlimitedness of the Lord, and the Lord commended him that his faith was great (Matt. 8:5-10). In terms of His humanity, the expression of the Lord on earth was limited and had not yet reached the highest point according to God's view. This was with respect to His power. This does not apply to His character; in His character, He could not have been more perfect. But in the manifestation of His power, He was limited. After His death and resurrection, He reached the stage of perfection and attained the highest peak.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II</H2><P>What is resurrection? Resurrection is for God to gain a man, a man whom He has hoped to gain from the very beginning. Our Lord was a perfect man when He was on earth, but He was limited. The man that God has been after from the foundation of the world is more than this. God wants resurrection. When the Lord Jesus resurrected, He broke all the barriers; nothing could limit Him any longer. When our Lord was living on earth, there was still the possibility of death. But after His resurrection, death could not touch Him any longer. Death was destroyed by Him, and the possibility of death was annulled by Him. After He resurrected, He told the apostle John, "I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever" (Rev. 1:18). He could die no more; the very possibility of death has been destroyed by Him. Man could no longer nail Him on the cross; there was no more possibility of death. This is resurrection. Resurrection is for God to gain, in our Lord, the man He intended to gain from eternity past! God said, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You" (Acts 13:33). This does not refer to Bethlehem, but to the resurrection. When the Lord was born in Bethlehem, God could not say this. Only after the Lord had resurrected could God say this. We have to remember that a man as perfect as the Lord Jesus in nature, character, and conduct was still limited and still needed resurrection before all the limitations could be removed. Resurrection means that a man has broken through all the barriers of man. The man whom God had sought after was gained on the day of the Lord's resurrection.</P><P>The Lord's resurrection was different from the resurrection of other men in the Bible. For example, in causing Lazarus to come out from the grave, the Lord merely brought him back to his former condition of living in the world. In other words, Lazarus was merely resuscitated; he was still wrapped in the cloth and could not move unless he was unwrapped (John 11:44). He merely recovered his physical life and became alive; he was not resurrected like the Lord Jesus. The resurrection of the Lord Jesus was different from that of Lazarus. Why did Peter and John believe in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus? On the first day of the week, they heard the report of Mary Magdalene and ran to the tomb to see. They saw the linen cloths that were used to wrap the Lord Jesus lying there and the handkerchief that had been over His head folded up in one place. But the person was gone, and they believed (20:6-8). Lazarus was still in the cloth; the cloth was still binding his body. But the Lord was not bound by the linen cloth; nothing could bind Him any longer. Before His resurrection, the Lord was also bound by the flesh and the material world. But after His resurrection, He was not bound any longer; even the barrier of death was broken. No barrier could limit Him any longer.</P><P>A brother once said, "After resurrection, the Lord did not come; He merely appeared. He did not go away; He merely disappeared." In the past He had to come and He had to go away. But today He does not need to come or go away. Today whether or not we see the Lord is a question of revelation; if a man has the revelation, he will see. If a man does not have the revelation, he will not see. If a man has the revelation, he will touch Him; if he does not have the revelation, he will not touch Him. It is a question of whether or not we see; it is not a question of His coming or going. There is no more problem about His coming and going because the limitations are gone and our Lord has resurrected.</P><P>After the Lord was resurrected, Thomas still doubted. He said, "Unless I see in His hands the mark of the nails and put my finger into the mark of the nails and put my hand into His side, I will by no means believe." But the Lord said, "Do not be unbelieving, but believing." Also He said, "Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed" (John 20:24-29). It is not a matter of touching with our hands; those who touch by faith will surely find Him. The Lord is the Lord of resurrection. The former limitations are gone. We have to touch this resurrected Lord by faith. If we believe, we will see the Lord. If we do not see the Lord, it is not because the Lord is absent but because our physical eyes cannot see Him. Space is no longer a problem, and time is no longer a problem either. The greatest restrictions placed on man are time and space, but none of these things can restrict our Lord today. The important matter is whether or not we can believe. Any time we look at the Lord with faith, we will see Him.</P><P>We can receive much help from the incident of the Lord raising up Lazarus. When Martha saw the Lord, she said, "If You had been here, my brother would not have died." The Lord said, "Your brother will rise again." What did Martha say? She said, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day." She was a Jew, and the Jews believed in the resurrection in the last day. The Lord said to her again, "I am the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25). In Martha's mind, resurrection was linked to the last day, but the Lord showed that as long as He is present, the question of the last day does not exist because He is the resurrection. As long as He is present, the question of time is over. Resurrection means that time is not a problem and space is not a problem. No previous limitation is a problem anymore.</P><P>Our Lord was resurrected. While the disciples were gathering together behind closed doors, the Lord came into their midst and appeared to them. He came in without opening the door (John 20:19, 26). He appeared to the two disciples who were on their way to Emmaus. When they recognized Him, He disappeared suddenly (Luke 24:31). This is the wonder of resurrection. He transcends over time and space. Within a second, He can travel from here to the end of the earth. He does not have to wait for three or five years to accomplish something. We do not have to pray for eight or ten years to receive something. Here is One who has transcended over time and space. This One is the resurrected Lord. The Lord was on earth for over thirty years. Humanly speaking, His wisdom and stature grew (2:52). But after His resurrection He manifested the full power of God. This power broke through the greatest barrier, death. His life transcended over time and space; His life broke through death. Therefore, our Lord is the eternal One. Man is limited by death, but our Lord is not limited by death. This is the resurrection of our Lord.</P><P>We all know that death is a great limitation. All living creatures come to their end at death. The greatest limitation to all living things, whether blades of grass or large trees, is death. A cat or a dog may follow us for three or five years; they may be very clever and useful. But they cannot live forever; their lives are limited. Once they die, they are through. The same is true with man. The foolish rich man might be very good at planning, but "God said to him, Foolish one, this night they are requiring your soul from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be?" (Luke 12:20). Once death comes, everything is over. As long as a man is in his body, he can do many things and be very useful. But his usefulness stops at death. However, with our Lord, death no longer exists. Death has been shattered by our Lord. Death cannot hold Him. Holding is to limit, and resurrection has broken through the greatest limitation. No gate, city, or mountain can stop resurrection. No problem of yesterday, today, or tomorrow can stop Him. He is not only living, but He will not die. He not only will not die, but He has no possibility of death. He is the living one. He became dead, but He is alive, and He will live forever and ever (Rev. 1:18). In Him, all barriers have been broken.</P><P>Resurrection is the power of God. Ephesians 1:20-21 says, "Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all...not only in this age but also in that which is to come." After the Lord resurrected, He sat on the right hand of God and was far above all things. Everything that can be named is under Him, not only in this age, but in that which is to come. In creation God did not gain the man He was after, but after the Lord's resurrection God gained such a man. God wanted to gain a created man who is the same as He is. If He cannot gain a created man who is the same as He is, He has not gained what He is after. Only the self-existing and ever-existing God is above all things. However, God wants man, who is neither self-existing nor ever-existing, to also transcend over all things. There must be one created man who is transcendent over all things before God's goal can be attained. When the Lord resurrected from the dead and was received to the right hand of the Father, He annulled all the limitations of death, as well as all other restrictions, and God gained the man that He was after.</P><P>We must see that the Lord was incarnated to be a representative man. He lived thirty three and a half years on earth as a representative, and after His resurrection He was still a representative. During His thirty or more years on earth, He was a representative of what man should be in his moral standard. In other words, He spoke forth God's demand on man's morality. After His resurrection when He appeared to the disciples for forty days, He was a representative of what God would give to man as far as power is concerned. On the one hand, the Lord Jesus was a representative of the standard man that God desires. In Him we see God's requirement on man's morality, conduct, and spiritual condition. Therefore, if the Lord Jesus had not died for us and redeemed us from sin, His living on earth would have only been a condemnation of our sins, because we have all come short of the glory of God, and He, as a man, received God's glory and fulfilled God's glory. He was a standard man. When we compare ourselves with Him, we all become sinners and have come short. When the Lord Jesus was manifested in the flesh on earth, the moral standard which He maintained became the standard for every man. When God declared, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You," it did not refer to Bethlehem, but to resurrection. It was on the day of resurrection that the Lord said to Mary Magdalene, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" (John 20:17). This shows us that as sons of God, we begin from resurrection. God wants not only a moral man, but a man of power. Man cannot satisfy God by having a proper moral standard alone; there must also be great power. Since Bethlehem, the Lord Jesus never once came short of God's glory. He was the man with the highest standard of morality. But after the Lord's resurrection, when God declared, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You," He manifested another aspect of man-the man of power. At that time, there was no further problem with time and space. There was no problem with anything. The only remaining question is whether or not man sees it.</P><P>Resurrection is too deep a subject. Strictly speaking, we can only touch a little of this subject. We have to sing a song to praise our Lord's resurrection:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Thousands of years went by, and we see only men leaving;<br>The number who left were in tens of thousands.<br>It had become a law to leave and not to return;<br>We see no one returning.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Death has its locks, and Hades its gates;<br>But they are only for shutting up,<br>For keeping men in, and not for letting men out;<br>This traffic is one way only!</P><P CLASS=HBODY>God's Son once passed through these gates,<br>Which were doubly bolted.<br>Though death tried its best,<br>He rested as ordinary men.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Since He is life, He can resurrect;<br>Yet He waited for three days.<br>He was restricted only by the Spirit,<br>But was not limited in power.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Hallelujah, He has resurrected!<br>Of all the thousands who have gone,<br>Only this One returned;<br>Only His tomb is empty.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>He has once for all destroyed<br>The once victorious ground of death.<br>The sting of death has stung Him once,<br>And can no more attack.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Since one has returned, all will return;<br>He is the Firstfruit.<br>We who have wilted through Adam,<br>Are resurrected through Christ.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Hallelujah, Christ is Victor!<br>Never to be imprisoned again.<br>Hallelujah, the power of death<br>Is now shattered forever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III</H2><P>Acts 2 shows us clearly what resurrection is. It also shows us what the Holy Spirit is. Resurrection destroys the bondage of death for us. The resurrected Lord has transcended over everything. What then is the Holy Spirit? When the Lord resurrected, He was raised up by God's right hand to His side. Once He reached the right hand of the Father, He poured out the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the power of the Holy Spirit is the power of resurrection. The Lord put both resurrection as well as the power of resurrection in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit brings these down to earth. Therefore, we cannot separate resurrection from the Holy Spirit. Anyone who touches resurrection touches the Holy Spirit. Anyone who touches the Holy Spirit touches resurrection. On the day of Pentecost, that which was poured out from on high, which was seen and heard by men, was the Holy Spirit. What was the purpose of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit? It was to testify that the Lord has resurrected. Does the Holy Spirit testify in words only? No, everyone who touches the Holy Spirit knows that the Lord Jesus has resurrected.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, some leaned on His bosom; others received things from His hand. Some touched the hem of His garment, and some had their feet washed by the Lord. The Lord raised up the body of one person and touched the eyes of another with His spittle mixed with clay. Now the Lord Jesus has resurrected; He is now in the Holy Spirit. The Lord we see could not be seen or touched by those who saw Him when He was on earth. The Lord we see today is much deeper than the Lord they saw. The Lord we touch is the resurrected Lord. Those who knew the Lord when He was on earth could say that His wisdom and stature grew. Those who encountered Him could say that they had met Him when He was twelve or when He was thirty years of age. They could say that they knew His brothers, His parents, and His history. But the Lord we have touched has transcended all "growth." This Lord has transcended over all boundaries. Even the last boundary, death, has been broken through.</P><P>How can the church extend itself for two thousand years? It continues to exist because at various times men have seen the resurrected Lord. During the past two thousand years of church history, various people here and there were clear within; they saw the Lord within them. Concerning the outward Christ, we admit that we cannot see as clearly as the men in the Gospels; we have not seen what they saw. We do not know what the Lord was like when He was in the flesh. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the Lord today is far clearer than the men in the Gospels. Within us, we are clearer than they were. We are touching the Lord from within.</P><P>Therefore, what is the Holy Spirit doing on earth today? The Holy Spirit is conveying to us the resurrected Christ. If anyone tells me that he knows the Holy Spirit but does not know resurrection, I will say that this is impossible. This Christ has transcended over everything; He has transcended over time, space, death, and all barriers. This Christ is now in the Holy Spirit! The Holy Spirit is the Spirit that raised Jesus from among the dead. The power of the Holy Spirit is the power of resurrection. Wherever the Holy Spirit works, there is the manifestation of the power of resurrection. Wherever the Holy Spirit is, there is resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV</H2><P>Let us read Ephesians 1:22-23: "And He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all." Brothers and sisters, have we seen what is the church? When the Lord Jesus was living on earth, He was a perfect man. However, He was not the Head of the church, because He was limited and the possibility of death was still upon Him. The possibility of death had not yet been shattered. If we say that He was the Head of the church at that time, then the church was limited also. After the Lord resurrected, He became the Head of the church, and the church became His Body. He has transcended over everything, and the church has also transcended over everything. It is true that the Lord was powerful when He was on the earth. If we had the power that the Lord had on earth, we would be satisfied already. But God was not satisfied; this was not enough. The Lord Jesus had to resurrect from the dead to destroy the greatest barrier, and God had to put all things under His feet and make Him the Head over all things to the church before the church could become His Body. After the Lord's resurrection, the church became His Body. The Lord Jesus has resurrected from the dead. He is now the Head of the church, and the church is now His Body. The Head and the Body are of the same nature and are the same in everything. Just as the Head has transcended over everything, the Body has transcended over everything. Just as Christ is unlimited, the church is unlimited.</P><P>Humanly speaking, we are still living in the flesh and still limited by time and space. But as far as the nature of the church is concerned, it is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. It is the vessel that holds the resurrection life of Christ. Therefore, the church can experience the resurrection power of Christ. Brothers and sisters, we have to remember that "we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us" (2 Cor. 4:7). On one hand, we cannot deny that we are useless earthen vessels, but on the other hand, we must see that God has given us the resurrection life of Christ. Faith will bring us the experience of this resurrection power. Church history tells us that the church experiences resurrection a little here and a little there throughout its time on earth. We can say that the church is built on the foundation of resurrection. One day when the saints are raptured and their bodies are redeemed, we will fully and completely manifest the power of this resurrection.</P><P>We can consider the experience of the church in the first century. In the first century, the gospel was spread by a few Galilean fishermen. As far as their own condition was concerned, they were uneducated men of no renown, and they did not have any courage of their own. Although Peter was the strongest among the twelve disciples, on the night of the Lord's betrayal, he would only follow the Lord from a distance. In the courtyard of the High Priest, he could not pass the test of a maid's questioning, and he denied the Lord three times. This proves that he was just the same as all the other disciples, weak and fearful. But on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit descended on them, Peter stood up with the other eleven to speak and no longer acted like a fearful and illiterate fisherman. He performed many miracles (Acts 2:43). They were persecuted, arrested, and threatened by the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees. When they were forbidden to preach about the resurrection of the Lord, they answered, "For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard" (4:20). They were so bold to speak the Lord's word that even when the ones who examined them "perceived that they were uneducated men and laymen, they marveled" (vv. 1-21). Their weakness was changed to strength because they knew the power of Christ's resurrection. They were no longer living by their natural life but were living by the power of resurrection.</P><P>While Stephen was being stoned by the crowd for the sake of the Lord's word, he had no hatred in him but cried, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them" (Acts 7:60). This kind of power can only come from the resurrection life.</P><P>When Paul and Silas were imprisoned in the jail, they were not disappointed and did not lose heart. They did not grieve or weep, but while they were "praying, [they] sang hymns of praise to God" (Acts 16:25). The result was that even the jailor and his household believed in God. This power was also a manifestation of the resurrection power of Christ through them.</P><P>In order to know the power of resurrection, there is the need of revelation. Therefore, we need the prayer of Ephesians 1: "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him...that you may know what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead" (vv. 17, 19). According to the original language, "might" belongs to "strength." Therefore, it is "the might of His strength"; might issues from strength. This verse tells us about the might that God operates in those who believe. This might is the might which operated in Christ in resurrecting Him from the dead. In other words, the same might which God operated in raising Christ from the dead to become free from the bondage of death and all other barriers is manifested in us who believe.</P><P>We thank God that the church has experienced this resurrection power in reality. We are regenerated through His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). When we preach the gospel to others and they receive it, the result is a fruit of resurrection. The Lord said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth" (Matt. 28:18). He also said, "For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst" (18:20). If two and three are harmonious concerning any matter, the power of resurrection is manifested. Therefore, any time a man experiences regeneration, spiritual edification, or the exercise of holiness, the power of resurrection is manifested (Rom. 8). In 1 Corinthians 15 Paul "labored more abundantly" (v. 10) and was able to "die daily" (v. 31) because of the presence of resurrection. In 2 Corinthians 11, Paul could say of himself: "In labors more abundantly, in imprisonments more abundantly, in stripes excessively, in deaths often. Under the hands of the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one; three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep; in journeys often, in dangers of rivers,...in labor and hardship; in watchings often; in hunger and thirst; in fastings often; in cold and nakedness-apart from the things which have not been mentioned, there is this: the crowd of cares pressing upon me daily, the anxious concern for all the churches" (vv. 23-28). What was the power that upheld him and caused him to suffer so willingly? It was the power of resurrection. Philippians 3 shows us that Paul was able to know "the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death" because he knew Christ "and the power of His resurrection" (v. 10).</P><P>Among God's children, we can find many who have such experience. Some were in a prolonged illness, but through knowing the power of resurrection, they were able to lift up their head and praise God. Some encounter great pain, tribulations, and shame. According to their natural constitution, these things are beyond their power (2 Cor. 1:8), but they are able to endure all these because of the power of resurrection. As the Scripture says, "We are pressed on every side but not constricted; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out; persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed" (4:8-9). All these prove one fact, "that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us" (v. 7).</P><P>We have to remember that the nature of the Body is the same as the nature of the Head. We have to go before God and ask Him to grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we will realize that resurrection power is something for us to experience and that the church should enjoy God's resurrection power. The resurrection power of Christ is already in us. We should ask God to open our eyes so that we would know the might of the strength that is within us and would be strengthened by this resurrection power. If we do this, we will not be as weak, impotent, self-loving, and self-pitying as we are today; we will be empowered in the face of sin, the devil, and the flesh and will be able to transcend over all these things. These things will not be able to entangle, affect, or restrict us any longer.</P><P>Oh, resurrection is too great a matter; it is not something that can be described with words or understood with the mind. May the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant, richly grant the church a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that the church would truly know Christ and the power of His resurrection. Amen!</P><P>Finally, let us sing a hymn concerning the experience of resurrection:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Life out of death-dear Master, is it spoken<br>Of the life here, or in the better land?<br>Nay, wherefore wait? The vessel marred and broken,<br>Shall now be moulded by the Potter's hand.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Life out of death-oh, wondrous resurrection!<br>Seed sown in conscious weakness, raised in power;<br>Thy life lived out in days of toil and friction,<br>"Not I, but Christ" in me from hour to hour.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Life out of death-a pilgrim path and lonely,<br>Trodden by those who glory in the Cross.<br>They live in fellowship with "Jesus only,"<br>And for His sake count earthly gain but loss.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Life out of death-blest mission to be ever<br>Bearing the living water brimming o'er.<br>With life abundant from the clear, pure river,<br>Telling that thirsty souls need thirst no more.</P><P>The first stanza is a question. Is this life out of death something of today, or does one have to wait for the future? Based on what the writer learned and experienced, he answered: "Nay, wherefore wait? The vessel.../Shall now be moulded by the Potter's hand." This is a reference to the words of Jeremiah 18:4. The vessel was marred already. But the potter used the same clay to make another one. This is life out of death; this is resurrection. The emphasis is "here"; it is not the future or tomorrow.</P><P>Stanza two tells us how wonderful this resurrection is. "Seed sown in conscious weakness, raised in power." This is according to 1 Corinthians 15:43 which says, "It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power." The power of resurrection will be manifested in the body. On that day the body will be transfigured. But even today this resurrection life will be the strength of our body. "Thy life lived out in days of toil and friction." Many toils and sufferings are beyond what we can bear. If we tried to bear them, we would fail within a minute. Yet His life has sustained us. Indeed, "`Not I, but Christ' in me from hour to hour."</P><P>Stanza three includes the phrase "a pilgrim path and lonely." Following this, it says, "Trodden by those who glory in the Cross./They live in fellowship with `Jesus only.'" This is due to the fact that such a one has known the power of the Lord's resurrection. The resurrection mentioned in Philippians 3 is mentioned here.</P><P>Stanza four brings in John 7. On the last day of the feast, our Lord stood up and cried with a loud voice, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" (vv. 37-38). This refers to the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive. The power of the Holy Spirit is the power of resurrection. Those who have experienced the Lord's resurrection should also supply others with the Lord's resurrection. This resurrection life, this abundant life, will tell thirsty souls that they need thirst no more. What a blessed commission!</P><P>If we read this hymn a few more times, it will help us to understand what this life that comes out of death is, and what resurrection is.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A NOBLE DEED</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Mark 14:1-9</H1><P>Mark 14:9 says, "And truly I say to you, Wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her." According to the Lord's word here, wherever the gospel is preached, this story should be told immediately afterwards. If the gospel is preached, but this story is not told, there is a great lack. Therefore, we have to speak of this story today. This is what the Lord told me as I was praying yesterday.</P><P>When did this story take place? Let us read verse 1: "Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were two days away. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to seize Him by craftiness and kill Him." The cross was in sight! The shadow of the cross was in sight!</P><P>What is the most significant point of this story? We can express it with the words of 1 Peter 3:15. It is to "sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts." The word sanctify is a verb. This story shows a practical way for the carrying out of this verse.</P><P>This story only invokes men to do one thing-to sanctify Christ as Lord. The Lord's word, "Wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her," is an instruction to us that, after the preaching of the gospel, there must be this kind of fruit. This story unfolds to us the meaning of this kind of fruit.</P><P>"A woman came [Mary-John 12:3], having an alabaster flask of ointment, of very costly pure nard." Pure nard is precious enough, whereas a very costly, pure nard is unmatched in excellence. This very costly, pure nard was inside an alabaster flask. The alabaster flask was also very precious. Not only was Mary offering to the Lord a costly ointment, but the flask that contained the ointment was also very precious. We can offer to the Lord only what is most precious.</P><P>"She broke the alabaster flask." Why did she do this? This kind of pure nard came from Persia, and there was no way for the ointment to come out except by breaking the flask. In this way, there could be no counterfeit.</P><P>"And poured it over His head." When she did this, the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment (John 12:3). Not only was the house filled with the fragrance then; even now as we read this passage, we can sense the fragrance! Even the house we are meeting in right now seems to be filled with fragrance! This love to the Lord and this consecration to Him indeed is a fragrance that has lasted until now and will last until eternity.</P><P>John 12:3 said that she "anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair." She placed her glory at the feet of the Lord! For a woman, her hair is her glory (1 Cor. 11:15).</P><P>At first she was only seen; now she could be smelled. She drew not only men's criticism, but men's indignation. However, she ignored all of them and did not care for them. It did not cross her mind that this was the house of a leper. She did not consider her present family condition nor her future hardships. She did not care for the criticism and the indignation of others. She simply did what she did.</P><P>She offered to the Lord in the way of "risking all"! We should be just as bold and willing as she was. "And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment." This is absolute consecration. There are two meanings to consecration. One is to offer something to the Lord, and the other is to be separated solely unto the Lord in a dedicated way.</P><P>The ointment is for sanctification. The tabernacle with all its utensils was anointed. The word Christ means the "Messiah," which is the Anointed One. We should sanctify this anointed Christ as Lord. We should anoint Him and own Him as Lord, even as our Lord. We should offer up everything to Him and should heap everything upon Christ. We should not be afraid of following Him too foolishly or loving Him too fervently. When a young Christian bade farewell to an older man, the latter said, "I have only one wish, that you be a fervent lover of Christ!" There cannot be a limit to our loving the Lord, our serving Him, obeying Him, and our allegiance to Him; we can never overdo these things. The Lord loves to see us loving Him in a reckless way. He loves to see us loving Him beyond reason and against human affection. To Him, the gospel should result in men's being constrained by His death to love Him, consecrate to Him, and fully obey Him to the point that others would consider them extreme.</P><P>The degree that we offer ourselves to Him is dependent on the worth of the Lord to us. To those who believe, the Lord is precious (1 Pet. 2:7). Peter knew what this word meant. This is why in his Epistles, he mentioned the word precious many times. He added the word precious to the blood, the faith, the stone, the virtues, and so forth.</P><P>What did the disciples do when Mary acted this way? "But there were some who were indignantly commenting among themselves: Why has this waste of the ointment been made?" (Mark 14:4). They thought that this was a waste. But on whom was the ointment poured? Was the One being anointed not worthy of the ointment? This ointment was poured on the Lord. If this was a waste, it would mean that the Lord was not worthy of it. Was the Lord indeed not worthy of this ointment? Can anything be called a waste when it is applied to the Lord? Those who have never loved the Lord with a single heart think that too much consecration and obedience is a waste. In man's eyes, obeying the Lord, loving Him, and giving up everything for Him may sometimes be too much and may be a waste, but such criticism only shows the degree of love that the criticizing ones have.</P><P>"For this ointment could have been sold for over three hundred denarii and given to the poor" (v. 5). They had a better way of using the money, which was to give to the poor. They considered it too much to serve the Lord but not too much to serve men. If a man does not have a love for Christ, he will surely replace the love that he ought to offer to the Lord with works that he does for the Lord. If a man thinks that offering the best to the Lord is a waste, he will surely spend his best on men. If a man is not a Christian, he saves everything for himself. Since he is a Christian, he knows that it is wrong to be selfish. The question is, on whom should the three hundred denarii be spent? Either it is spent on Christ, or it is spent on men. What a pity that many believers today are like the disciples of that day. They do not have a heart single for Christ; they do not have the chastity and the fervent love for Christ. Instead, they try to fill this lack with hard works.</P><P>"And they were infuriated with her" (v. 5). At the beginning they were only criticizing. Later they began to be infuriated with the woman, but Mary could not keep back the ointment just because they were infuriated. The flask was broken and the ointment had flowed out. No sacrifice can be retrieved from the altar. Mary dared to do this out of love to the Lord. She did not care about the others' criticism and fury.</P><P>What did our Lord say? He said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her?" (v. 6). What the Lord meant was that it was all right for her to love Him and obey Him too much. There was no need to criticize her. Criticizing her this way was to trouble her. Oh, even if we love the Lord too much or offer to Him too much, He will still forgive us!</P><P>The Lord thought that it would be wonderful if they would love Him as much as Mary did. But if they could not do it themselves, they should not stop others from loving Him this way. Our hands should not touch all those who love the Lord, and we should not bother them.</P><P>Such an act of Mary was indeed a waste and was too much in the eyes of man. To the ordinary mind, it was enough to use some ointment; there was no need to use the pure nard. And even if pure nard was used, there was no need to have it in an alabaster flask. Even if one used an alabaster flask, there was no need to spend three hundred denarii on it. They could not keep themselves from criticizing and even becoming infuriated. But to the Lord, this act should not be criticized. The Lord said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her?" To the Lord, their criticism and fury were a kind of trouble to her. The Lord thought that such an act was permissible. This was why He said, "She has done a noble deed on Me"! Mary's act was a noble deed and should not be criticized.</P><P>At that time, three hundred denarii was enough money to buy a slave. It was enough to hire a few laborers for a few months. When the Lord went to Bethany and stayed at the house of Mary, Martha was busy serving; she did not have any slave to help her. This shows that they were not rich. But Mary did not care for her own ease and comfort; she spent her all on the Lord. We cannot be too much in loving the Lord and in serving Him. It is not a waste to spend everything on the Lord.</P><P>"She has done a noble deed on Me" (v. 6). The Lord was opposed to the disciples' concept, who thought that such an anointing and consecration to Him was a waste. The Lord said that it was a noble deed and not a waste. It is a noble deed to love Him too much, to obey Him too much, and to be spent on Him too much; it is not a waste. It is a noble deed to love Him to the extent that we forget about the criticism of those who are older in the Lord. It is a noble deed to love Him to the extent that we forget about the need of the poor outside. It is not a waste. It is a noble deed to love Him to the extent that we waste everything on Him. This is not a waste. The Lord thinks that we can never be too much in the way we treat Him. Our love to Him can never be too much. Our obedience to Him can never be too much. No matter how man sees it, and no matter how those who serve together criticize, the Lord says that this is a noble deed. The result of the preaching of the gospel is not only to send sinners to heaven but to make every saved person a lover of Christ. This is why the Scripture says, "If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed!" (1 Cor. 16:22).</P><P>All the Marys should be satisfied with this word from the Lord. If we expect approval from our fellow disciples, we have to live according to the worldly wisdom, and we cannot consecrate out of a care for what is on the Lord's heart. We should be satisfied with the Lord's approval, and we should not be concerned about men's criticism.</P><P>The Lord was not opposed to the idea of giving to the poor. He was only opposed to their remark that this was too much and that it was a waste to do it on the Lord. He told them, "For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you do not always have Me" (Mark 14:7). The Lord meant that there would be many more opportunities for them to give to the poor, but the time was short for them to serve Him.</P><P>"She has done what she could" (v. 8). The question here is not how much was done but how much was left. For a rich man to give a little to the Lord is not difficult, but it is difficult for a poor person to offer up all he has to the Lord. "She has done what she could." She did not save anything for herself. Praise comes from the word all. Without giving "all," there is no love. If we love God, we have to love with all our heart, all our soul, all our strength, and all our mind. Many times our attitude toward the Lord is no better than our attitude toward a taxi driver. Sometimes we give a few coins to the taxi driver, but we think it is a waste to give even a few coins to the Lord. What a pity this is!</P><P>Why did Mary do this? Let us see what the Lord said.</P><P>"She has anointed My body beforehand for the burial" (v. 8). In another two days the Lord would die. In the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord mentioned four times to the disciples that He was going to die, but they did not understand it. Only Mary understood. She understood that the Lord was going to die for her and that He would die to deliver her from the punishment of hell. She loved the Lord, and she had to anoint Him. The real power of love to the Lord comes from the death of the Lord. Those who do not understand the Lord's death cannot really love Him.</P><P>One has to be on time to anoint the Lord. After the Lord resurrected, it was too late to anoint Him! Mary Magdalene bought some ointment and went early on the first day of the week to anoint the Lord's body, but she could not anoint Him. The Lord had resurrected, and it was too late.</P><P>"Anointed My body beforehand." This is Christ. Today is the time for us to consecrate ourselves to the Lord. If we wait, it may be too late! After the Lord resurrected, it was too late to anoint Him. After we have resurrected, it will be too late to consecrate ourselves to Him and love Him single-heartedly. At the time of the resurrection, even if there were a thousand worlds, we would gladly give them all up to love the Lord Jesus. But now we need to have the fullness of love that we will have for Him after the resurrection. Now is the time for us to love the Lord.</P><P>Romans 6 speaks of presenting our members to God. Romans 12:1 speaks of the presenting of our bodies in particular. This is total consecration. It is easier to present the members, but it is hard to present the body. However, such a presenting is holy. True holiness comes from an absolute consecration. This presenting is also reasonable. It is not a waste. May we offer ourselves absolutely to the Lord, and may we love Him, serve Him, and obey Him while today is still today.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PATHWAY TO GLORY-</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THROUGH JERUSALEM</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 9:28-31</H1><P>The word we should pay attention to in this passage is "Jerusalem." I will clarify a few things first, and then I will come back to this. The Bible records that God spoke to the Lord Jesus from the heavens three times. The first time was when the Lord Jesus rose up from baptism (Matt. 3:16-17); the second time was on the mount of transfiguration (Luke 9:28-35), and the third time was after the Lord said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone" (John 12:24-28). There is one reason why God spoke to the Lord Jesus these three times: He purposely chose the cross! He did not choose a way better than the cross! His baptism was a choice of the cross, a choice of death and burial. On the mount of transfiguration, He also chose the cross; He did not ascend to heaven from there. When He entered Jerusalem and a few Greeks requested to see Him, it was the most glorious moment of His life. But He still chose the cross. He did not choose to be a king as the result of men's adulation.</P><P>In today's passage, we see how the Lord chose the cross. Many people say that the mount of transfiguration is a type of the kingdom of God. But the Lord Jesus said that the mount of transfiguration was the kingdom of God. In Luke 9:27 He said clearly, "But I say to you truly, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God." The kingdom of God descended to the earth for a moment, and the Lord Jesus manifested His glory in the kingdom. The Lord could have ascended to heaven from there, but He was discussing all the things related to the fact of what "He was about to complete in Jerusalem." He purposely chose the cross. Two men, Moses and Elijah, were talking with Jesus. Elijah represents those who will be raptured, whereas Moses represents those who will be resurrected. At that time, the Lord Jesus was standing at the place of the rapture and the resurrection. However, He had a clear view and a clear vision that the pathway to glory was not the mount of transfiguration, but another way.</P><P>Before He came to the mount of transfiguration, the pathway was not so clear. Although it had been decided before the foundation of the world, the pathway became clear after the conversation on the mount of transfiguration. The pathway had to pass through Jerusalem. From this point on, we see the Lord descending from the mountain and heading toward Jerusalem. "And as the days were being fulfilled for Him to be taken up, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem" (Luke 9:51). "And He journeyed...making His way toward Jerusalem" (13:22). "In the same hour some Pharisees came up, saying to Him, Get out and go from here, for Herod wants to kill you" (v. 31). They were suggesting that the Lord change His course. But the Lord answered saying, "I must journey today and tomorrow and on the following day because it is not acceptable for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem" (v. 33). He headed straight toward Jerusalem and would not turn at all. Luke 17:11 says, "And as He was going to Jerusalem..." He did not change His course. Luke 18:31 says, "Behold we are going up to Jerusalem." Luke 19:11 says, "He was near Jerusalem." Verse 28 says, "And having said these things, He went on before them, going up to Jerusalem." Verse 37 says, "And as He was already drawing near..." Verse 41 says, "And as He drew near..." Verse 45 says, "And He entered into the temple." This shows us that the Lord approached Jerusalem step by step!</P><P>From Luke 9 to 23, we see a line that leads to Jerusalem. This course was set on the mount of transfiguration.</P><P>Was the Lord's heart for Jerusalem itself? No, it was not for Jerusalem but for what would be accomplished in Jerusalem, which was the cross. Jerusalem means the accomplishment of God's will, which is the bearing of the cross. On the mount of transfiguration, glory purposely descended to the world, and the Lord Jesus was enveloped in this glory. In that vision the Lord Jesus clearly saw that the way to glory was through Jerusalem. His face was set toward Jerusalem. Isaiah said that He set His face like a flint (Isa. 50:7). He faced Jerusalem with a stone-like face; there was no change in Him; He went straight from the mountain to the cross.</P><P>Why should we pay attention to this matter today? It is because the day of the rapture is near! The day when the Lord will rapture the saints is near! We are not speaking about who will or will not be raptured. We are saying that if a person wants to be raptured, he has to go to Jerusalem. This means that we have to bear the cross; we have to take this pathway. If God has shown us the glory, the rapture, and the resurrection, we have to obey His will and bear the cross, taking up the way of the cross. Please remember that even though the Lord Jesus knew that the time of His being taken up was at hand, He did not wait passively for the rapture. The Bible says, "And as the days were being fulfilled for Him to be taken up, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem" (Luke 9:51). The cross came before the rapture. If we know that the day is near, we should also set our mind to obey God's will concerning us, which is to bear the cross. The meaning of going up to Jerusalem is nothing other than bearing the cross, which accomplishes God's will.</P><P>What do we see along the way to Jerusalem? Let us consider the items one by one.</P><P>"And they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans...And they did not receive Him, because His face was set to go to Jerusalem" (Luke 9:52-53). The Samaritans did not receive the Lord for one reason: His face was set to go to Jerusalem. Whenever we set out to do God's will and take the way of the cross, others will not receive us. We have to ask God day after day to give us a stronger desire for His will. Although men may not be pleased, nevertheless the Lord knows us. At that time, two disciples could not stand the rejection of the Samaritans, and they wanted revenge. The Lord turned and rebuked the two of them, saying that they did not know of what kind of spirit they were. When we are rejected, we feel like saying, "Wait until the judgment seat, and we will see who is right." The Lord rebuked such an attitude. Having said that, the Lord turned to other villages. He did not have time to take care of the reaction of the Samaritans.</P><P>"And He journeyed throughout the cities and villages, teaching and making His way toward Jerusalem" (Luke 13:22). This teaches us not to drop everything to wait for the coming of God's kingdom just because the day of the rapture is near. Rather, we should continue in the way of the cross. This is the course; we cannot stop our daily work. The Lord taught as He made His way throughout the cities and villages. If the cross has done a deep enough work in us, everything will render us help and will cause us to gain deeper and richer experiences.</P><P>"In the same hour some Pharisees came up, saying to Him, Get out and go from here, for Herod wants to kill you. And He said to them, Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and accomplish healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I am perfected. However, I must journey today and tomorrow and on the following day because it is not acceptable for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem" (Luke 13:31-33). In these verses, the Lord spoke some strong words. He said that Herod was a fox. The Lord was comparing Herod to God. Those said that the will of the king had to be fulfilled; the Lord said that the will of God in heaven had to be fulfilled. Compared to God, Herod was just a fox. Although the fox was cunning, it could not stop the Lord from going to Jerusalem. The Lord could not stop His journey because of the word of a fox; He could not change His face or His course because of Herod. He said, "I must journey."</P><P>Luke 17:11-19 shows that on His way to Jerusalem, the Lord passed through Samaria and Galilee, and He healed ten lepers. This teaches us that along the way, if there is anything that we ought to do, we should do it. Whether it is the preaching of the gospel or the rendering of help to others, as long as it is something along the way, we should try our best to take care of it. The Lord was set for Jerusalem, but when anything came along His way, He took care of it. He did not decline just because He was set for Jerusalem. We certainly should not change our direction because of the things that come to us along the way, and we should not be caught away by the things we meet to the point that we stop advancing. We should work, and we should save others. However, our course should be set toward Jerusalem. If something is a frustration to our journey toward Jerusalem, we should stop that work. The Lord could have healed the ten lepers on the way and then stopped there without going further to Jerusalem. He also could have healed all the lepers in Samaria, but if He had done this, He would not have been able to save us. It is right for Christians to save sinners and help others. But if a person is stopped by these things from doing God's will, he should not continue them. These things should only be done along the way. It is right to wait for the rapture, but it is also right to do our best to save others. Revelation 22:17 is very meaningful. It says, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say, Come!" These two "come's" are the prayer of the Spirit and the bride for the Lord's coming. Following this, it says, "And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely." This shows that after we yearn for His coming, we preach the gospel. May we save a few more men while we are on the earth!</P><P>Last year I said that I hoped every brother and sister would save at least one person in 1929. How many have we actually saved? Of course, it is God who causes men to be saved, but have we done our best?</P><P>"And taking the twelve aside, He said to them, Behold we are going up to Jerusalem" (Luke 18:31). The Lord did not say "I am going," but "we are going." It is not enough for us to take the way of the cross alone; we should exhort others and lead them on to do God's will and carry the cross also. How do we wait for the rapture? C. H. Mackintosh said, "It is one thing for us to believe that the Lord will come. It is another thing for us to wait for His coming." God does not want us to believe in the Lord's coming in creed only; He wants us to wait for the coming of His Son. The church should pass through everything that God has ordained for it. The book of Ephesians is filled with God's grace. Yet at the same time, it is filled with man's responsibility. If God has not gained what He has purposed, He will not be satisfied. "And all things which have been written through the prophets regarding the Son of Man will be accomplished" (Luke 18:31). May everything God has ordained for us be accomplished in us.</P><P>"He spoke further a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately. He said therefore, A certain man of noble birth went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return" (Luke 19:11-12). The disciples thought that as soon as they entered Jerusalem, God's kingdom would come and the Lord would be king. The disciples thought that they were going to Jerusalem to enjoy the blessing, but the Lord told them that they were going there to suffer. The disciples thought that going to Jerusalem was for reigning, but the Lord told them that it was for dying on the cross. Going to "a distant country" is to go to heaven, but before that, before the rapture and the resurrection, there must be greater sufferings and darker environments. The shadow of the great tribulation seems to be here already. Before the rapture, there will surely be heavier crosses!</P><P>"And having said these things, He went on before them, going up to Jerusalem" (Luke 19:28). He is leading us on in the way which is ahead of us. A year before that, His face had been toward Jerusalem. Here, it was still the same. He did not change. He does not charge us to go while He stays behind; rather, He leads us along the way.</P><P>After the Lord arrived in Jerusalem, we know that He entered the city every day, and at night He stayed at the Mount of Olives. Let us consider His prayer on the last night at Gethsemane, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will...Again, going away a second time, He prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done" (Matt. 26:39, 42). Some interpret the "cup" mentioned at Gethsemane as dying. This interpretation is not entirely correct. The cup refers to the cross. In other words, the Lord asked God to spare Him from going to the cross if it was possible. But then the Lord also said, "Not as I will, but as You will." The Lord could pray, "If it is possible, let this cup pass from Me," but He could not pray, "If it is possible, let Your will not be fulfilled." It is true that the cup was important. But there is a distinction between the cup and God's will. The Lord showed us that God's will was more important than the cross. The second time He prayed, He put the cross and God's will together, and He obeyed, knowing that the cross was God's will. Before this time He could choose, but once He knew that the cup was God's will, He obeyed.</P><P>Brothers, what is the mount of transfiguration? The mount of transfiguration is glory; it is the glory after the rapture and the resurrection. However, the mount of transfiguration not only signifies glory; it also signifies a revelation, a vision, and a clear view. The mount of transfiguration reveals that the pathway to glory is through Jerusalem. Today we need the revelation, the vision, and the view of the mount of transfiguration, so that we will clearly see that unless we carry out God's will by bearing the cross, we cannot expect to be raptured. Knowing the coming glory without having the revelation concerning how to enter the coming glory is useless. May the Spirit of God grant us a spiritual vision, so that we know the relationship between the rapture and the accomplishment of God's will. After we have such a view, may we bear the cross and follow the Lord faithfully unto death. May we be like our Lord, who was set toward Jerusalem and did not turn at all. May we be able to say what Paul said, that we have not disobeyed the heavenly vision.</P><P>The glory is in sight, yet the sufferings are here! The day of the rapture is near, yet we must first pass through the cross. The day of the rapture is near, but there is a calling to purposefully carry out God's will and obey Him. This is the pathway which led the Lord to be taken up! The rapture is ordained, and the pathway to Jerusalem is also ordained. Once we are raptured, everything will be over. The times when we experience the most suffering with the Lord are the times when we are most intimate with Him. The times when we feel that the Lord is closest to us are the times when we are suffering with Him. The Lord is ahead of us, and we are behind Him. We should follow the Lord to finish this course!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ANNOUNCEMENT<br>CONCERNING THE DISCONTINUATION OF NOTES ON SCRIPTURAL MESSAGES<br>AND THE RESUMPTION OF THE CHRISTIAN</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 50</H2><P>In the winter of 1927, having become clear concerning God's will that I was especially called to bear testimony to the spiritual side of the truth (which excludes everything that might cause dispute regarding prophecy, the church, and Bible interpretation), I discontinued The Christian and reissued The Present Testimony. This does not mean that the work of The Christian is unimportant; on the contrary, it has a significant place. But I feel that what the Lord has committed to me are truths more in keeping with the nature of The Present Testimony of these few years. Teachings which are in keeping with the nature of The Christian are also greatly needed, but what the Lord has not committed to me, I must wait for someone else to do.</P><P>In 1930, after seeing so many young believers (spiritually speaking) without help, I published a simpler and easier paper entitled Notes on Scriptural Messages. It was my hope that God's children might receive benefit and be linked up with the truths which have the nature of The Present Testimony. Meanwhile, in my heart I continually expected and frequently mentioned to the co-workers that it would be best if God would raise up someone else to do this in-between work.</P><P>Last year during the time of my weakness I received a special dealing from God. At that time I felt deeply that if I continued in this way, I could not adequately accomplish the things God had committed to me. There was also the danger of making void my obedience of 1927 if I continued to be careless. As a result I had the thought then of discontinuing Notes on Scriptural Messages.</P><P>This matter was brought up to the brothers this year during the conference and it was pointed out that since so many brothers have been raised up, they should begin to take up the burden for many things. The unanimous decision of the brothers then was to resume the publication of The Christian and to allow me to discontinue the Notes on Scriptural Messages.</P><P>This does not mean that I will no longer bear the responsibility of The Christian. I will be happy to follow after the brothers and publish in The Christian the manuscripts which I have accumulated from the past. But as for me, from now on I will only bear the spiritual testimony.</P><P>Notes on Scriptural Messages will cease with this issue and The Christian will resume with the next issue. May God receive the glory in our new arrangement!</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>June, 1934</P></body></html>
