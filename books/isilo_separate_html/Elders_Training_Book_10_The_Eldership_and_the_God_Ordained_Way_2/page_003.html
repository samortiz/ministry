Lord, we thank You for Your abundant grace, which is so sufficient for us. We thank You for Your dear presence, which meets all of our needs. We also thank You for Your constant patience. Lord, we thank You for Your anointing, the holy ointment, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, which is always anointing us. We thank You for Your Word, which is a rich and uplifted provision to us. We thank You for Your riches which You have given us in the past years and for all Your divine, holy, and spiritual provisions which we have experienced. Lord, we thank You that in Your sovereignty we are here and are gathered here into Your dear and precious name. Lord, we thank You for Your constant word, Your instant word, and Your repeated word. We thank You that You have not left us in darkness and that we are now in the light. Thank You for the light which follows us and shines within us, above us, and through us. Lord, we thank You for all these provisions, and we trust in You Yourself.</P><P>Lord, forgive us and cleanse us again. We thank You for Your precious blood, which cleanses us all the time. Lord, cleanse our conscience and our sensation. Cleanse us in every way that we may have a thorough fellowship with You and with one another. We do not agree that Your time would be wasted, so we pray that every minute will be under a proper and thorough fellowship with You. Give us the openness, the liberty, the freedom, and Your leading. Lord, we need You. You are our satisfaction. Lord, we cannot do or say anything apart from You in the way of doing something for You. We are simply here, open before You, waiting on You. We believe that in the short time we have together, You can do many things among us. Lord, we put this time into Your hands. Lord, break it, bless it, and make it an endless blessing.</P><P>Lord, defeat the enemy. We can never forget the devil, Satan, the slanderer, the accuser. Lord, we accuse him before You. As we touch Your throne, we look unto You&#151;nothing could turn us away from You. But Lord, You have to look at the evil one. He is Your enemy, and he is also our enemy. We hate him. We believe that all the negative things have come out of him. Lord, put him to shame. His place is not in the church, but in the lake of fire. He has been defeated, and the lake of fire is his place. We just condemn him by declaring and claiming the victory You have won on the cross. Hallelujah for the cross of Calvary! Lord, You have encountered him on the cross, and You have shamed him all these years. Shame him again today. Lord, the victory is Yours, and we enjoy the blessing. Thank You, Lord Jesus. We worship You as we worship the Father. We worship the divine Trinity in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
