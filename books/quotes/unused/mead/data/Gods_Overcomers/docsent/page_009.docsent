   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND EXPERIENCE Christ Having the First Place</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Life and Experience of the Christians Christ Having the First Place</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in the Christian Life Scripture Reading:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 Corinthians 5:14-15; Galatians 2:20</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The life of a Christian is Christ Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ being our life and Christ being our power are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can we be holy?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How can we be victorious?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1 Many think that holiness and victory mean being delivered from the little sins and dealing with the temper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2 Some think that holiness and victory mean being patient, humble, and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>3 Some think that holiness and victory mean putting the self and the flesh to death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>4 Some think that holiness and victory mean studying the Bible more, praying more, being careful, and trusting in the Lord for one s strength.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>5 Some know that power is with the Lord, that our flesh has been crucified on the cross, and that by faith, we should claim the Lord s power to overcome and be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>None of the above five cases is right.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fifth case may seem to be right, but actually it is not for the following reason:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is victory!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is holiness!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The victorious life, the holy life, the perfect life, are all Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From beginning to end, everything is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Outside of Christ, we have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ must have the first place in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The victorious life God has given us is not a thing, such as patience or meekness, but the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ never mends our wrongs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What we lack is not patience but a living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God will never tear a piece of cloth from Christ to mend our hole.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be short of patience is to be short of Christ, because God wants Christ to have the first place in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, to put the self to death is not holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Holiness is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ must have the first place in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If God were to cause us to have power, it would only make us powerful persons; Christ would not have the first place in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is my power; it is Christ who holds the first place in me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not have power because we are not weak enough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The power of Christ is made perfect in weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not that the Lord makes me powerful; but it is the Lord who is the power in my stead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Mr. Hudson Taylor saw that You are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The author of The Victorious Life saw that victory is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not that I draw power from Christ to help me be a man; rather, it is Christ who is the man in my place.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not that Christ gives me the power to be patient; rather, it is Christ who lives the patience out from me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, I allow You to live out from me!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not overcome by the Lord; rather, it is the Lord who overcomes through us!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not us overcoming through Him; rather, it is Him overcoming through us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By faith I commit myself to the Lord and allow the Lord to live Himself out of me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I do not live by Christ; rather, it is Christ who lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I live because of the life of Christ and also because of the faith in the Son of God v. 20b . When we believed and received the Son of God, not only did His life enter into us, but His faith also entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we can live because of His faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Victory is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Patience is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What we need is not patience, meekness, or love, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ must have the first place in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From within us, Christ lives out patience, meekness, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man deserves only to die.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is nothing else that he deserves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After God created Adam, He had a will, and Adam had to obey this will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But when God re-created us, it was not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He put us in death, and God Himself lives out His will from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not only see a substitutionary Savior on Mount Golgotha, we should also see a Lord within us who lives in our stead.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ is our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the past He was our righteousness for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the present He is our sanctification for us to live a holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the future He will be our redemption that our body may be redeemed 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He holds the first place in all things!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How can we enter into this victorious life?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must do the following things:</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Have Absolutely No Hope in Our Self</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must know the self thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must see that the self deserves only to die; any hope in the self must come to an end. Our end is God s beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We cannot receive the victory of Christ if we still have hope in our self.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ is living in us, but we have not given Him the ground to rule over us and reign within us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Have a Full Consecration</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must consecrate wholeheartedly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we do not see our utter weakness, we cannot accept the cross and fully consecrate ourselves, nor hand over all our rights to the Lord s hand to allow Him to be the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Believe</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After consecration we have to believe that Christ is being lived out in us and that He has taken over our rights.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Christ is to be lived out in our flesh in the same way that He was lived out of the flesh given Him through Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Christ today wants to live Himself out on the earth through our flesh as He did in His own flesh while on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Christ has to be lived out in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Our victory is based on our yielding to Christ the first place in all things and allowing Him to be the Lord in all of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Old Testament tells us how God s chosen people lived on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There was first the tabernacle as the center of the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Later the temple was their center.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The center of the temple was the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The tabernacle, the temple, and the ark all typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When the relationship between the Israelites and the tabernacle or the temple was proper, they were victorious; no nation could overcome them.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Although their enemies had learned warfare and they had not, they still overcame all their enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When something was wrong between them and the temple, they were carried away.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It did not depend on whether or not they had a competent king; neither did it depend on whether or not they were clever and able.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It depended only on whether or not something was wrong between them and the ark in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We must allow the Lord to have the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Only then will we be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must be concerned about the Lord s victory before we can have the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Once the hair of separation is shaven, there can be no victory.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The same is true with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we do not give Christ the highest place, we cannot be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If Christ does not have the first place in our heart, we cannot be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Morning, January 29</S>
