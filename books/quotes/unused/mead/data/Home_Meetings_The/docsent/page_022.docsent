   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN SPEAKING THE LIVING AND RICH WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR FOUR THINGS Scripture Reading: Acts 4:31; 8:4; 6:7; 12:24; 19:20; 1 Cor 1:18; 12:8; 2 Tim 4:2; 2 Thes 3:1; Col 4:3</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message my burden is just to exhort you to learn to speak the living and rich word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you read through the verses listed above you could see that each verse speaks about the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Each one bears a crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you put all the points together, you could see that the spoken word is something living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not only living, but also rich.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we are charged to speak is the living and rich word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to learn how to speak the living and rich word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>SPEAKING WITH</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>PRAYER, THE SPIRIT, AND BOLDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we speak the word of God, we have to speak it with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Acts 4:31 boldness is used for the speaking of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This boldness is very much related to the Spirit, and the Spirit is related to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This one verse is comprised of these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While they were beseeching, that is, while they were asking, petitioning, or praying to God, they were filled economically, outwardly, with the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through their prayer they experienced the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the Spirit they spoke the word of God with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can see that the speaking of God s word here is related to three things: prayer, the Spirit, and boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You could not have boldness without the Spirit, and you could not experience the Spirit without praying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Prayer brings us the Spirit, and the Spirit is the boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not only that the Spirit gives us boldness, but the Spirit Himself is the boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes we are timid because we are short of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because we are short of the Spirit, we do not have the boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Boldness always comes from the Spirit, and the Spirit comes from our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These three things, prayer, the Spirit, and boldness, are all wrapped up with our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to learn to pray that we may get the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we will have the boldness to speak the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE PROPER AND ADEQUATE SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this series of messages we have been stressing one thing: that we should always be speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have made it quite clear that this speaking is a divine speaking which is for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Christian meetings are for a purpose, and this purpose could not be carried out without speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If there is little speaking, then little of the meeting s purpose is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This purpose could only be carried out by the saints proper and adequate speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am concerned that you have not been adequately impressed and even more concerned that you may not be practicing this speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Acts 1:8 the word witness implies a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus said, But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A witness is a speaking one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are chosen and appointed, even assigned to be His speaking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all have to speak Him, speak for Him, and speak forth Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Revelation 12:11 says that the brothers overcome the accuser by three things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One of these is the word of their testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The word of our testimony is a weapon to defeat our enemy, the accuser.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we should not be silent, but open up our mouth to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must speak throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the time we have to be learning how to speak, how to be a genuine, constant, and instant speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You should speak the Lord s word continually.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is our daily duty.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We were chosen, regenerated, appointed, and even assigned with this commission.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is good to sing, This is my story, this is my song, speaking my Savior, all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Learn to speak the living and rich word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>GAINING A DEPOSIT</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>OF THE LIVING AND RICH WORD</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you are going to speak the living and rich word, you should not trust in some kind of inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Suppose you have never learned English, yet you trust in spiritual inspiration to enable you to speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I assure you, you could wait until the Lord comes back, and you would still not be speaking English.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To learn English you first have to learn the alphabet, then the words, then sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have to study English for many years before you are able to speak it in a living and rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the same way we could not have the living and rich word from the Bible just by inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the past you may have had the desire to speak something from the Bible, yet you felt that you were short of utterance, short of words.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You did not have the living and rich word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul s main thought in 1 Corinthians 12:8-11 is that the Spirit is distributing the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge to the saints while they are in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you do not read the Bible and therefore lack a rich deposit of the divine Word, you will come to the meeting empty.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then, even if the inspiration comes, you will not have the deposit you need.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you are going to serve people with a rich feast, you first need to get the groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you do not have the groceries, how could you cook a rich meal?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We all have to spend adequate time to pick up the Lord s word from the Bible.</S>
