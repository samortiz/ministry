   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DIVISIONS BEING CAUSED BY BRINGING THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OTHER THAN CHRIST INTO THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we study the reason for the division and scattering of the church, we find one thing: things other than Christ have been brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all know that the church is Christ Himself, that Christ and the church are one, and that the church is joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is divided and confused because of one reason only something other than Christ has been brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as something other than Christ is brought into the church, the church becomes divided and confused.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All division and confusion are due to bringing something other than Christ into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today s Christianity has been divided into many sects and denominations because things other than Christ have been brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is only one Christ, and Christ cannot be divided 1 Cor 1:13 ; however, divisions and confusion occur when things and matters other than Christ are brought into the church, creating a human mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When things and matters other than Christ are brought into the church, the church is divided.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a brother brings his thoughts into the church, the church will have a problem, and if another brother brings his concepts into the church, the church will be in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are not many reasons for division and confusion in the church; there is one basic reason things other than Christ are brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THINGS THAT THE CHURCH SHOULD NOT HAVE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Having nothing other than Christ is a principle by which we can measure all of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we measure according to this principle, we will discover that there are three categories of things that the church should not have and which are outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This does not mean that there are only three categories.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are many categories, but we will speak of only these three.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Special Names</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first category is the matter of special names.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since the church is the Body of Christ, she should not have another name.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can speak of the church as the church of Christ or the church of God cf.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1 Thes 1:1; 1 Cor 1:2 , but we cannot add any other name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we add any other name, we will bring things other than Christ into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, in today s Christianity many different names have been brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, the Lutheran Church brought in Luther, and the Wesleyan Church brought in Wesley.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are so many examples that we cannot enumerate them all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to one survey, there are approximately 1,500 different names of groups in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not overlook the matter of the name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a woman is married to Brother Huang, according to the Chinese proverb, she is following Brother Huang.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Prior to marrying Brother Huang, she was Miss Tsai because her maiden name was Tsai, but now she is Mrs. Huang.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since she is Mrs. Huang, she should not print name cards calling herself Mrs. Chang.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This would be terrible!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If Brother Huang learned of this, it would be a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, we need to see that we should not overlook the matter of a name.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since the church of Christ is the church of Christ, why should we call her the Lutheran Church or the Methodist Church?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This can be compared to calling a sister Mrs. Chang when she is really Mrs. Huang.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If she wants to be called Mrs. Chang, her husband s last name must be Chang.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if a Christian group receives much help from Wesley, they are unconsciously bringing the things of man into the church when they call themselves the Wesleyan Church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the things of man are brought into the church, the church becomes confused and divided.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Special Beliefs</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second reason for the confusion and division of Christianity is that they have special beliefs and creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many sects and factions are produced because of these differences.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It seems that the Bible is not sufficient for many groups in Christianity, because in addition to the Bible they must have creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every sect has a different creed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to realize that these creeds are not according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Practices based on special beliefs and creeds result in separation and division from others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, the Presbyterian Church emphasizes the elders management of the church, and the Baptist Church emphasizes a method of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These things become ordinances or creeds that distinguish Christians from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many of these things are apart from the Bible and cannot be found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible says, He who believes and is baptized shall be saved Mark 16:16 ; the Bible does not regulate how a person should be baptized or what method to use.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Insisting on certain methods results in that method becoming a special creed among a group.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This separates them from others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we study this matter in a serious way, we can see that every sect and group has a special creed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes people ask, Even though you say that you have no special name and that you are not a denomination, what are your beliefs?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not have any belief apart from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All our beliefs are in the Bible, and we do not have anything other than the Bible; we do not have special creeds or beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Special creeds and special beliefs come from man s will and natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the things of man are brought into the church, the church becomes confused and divided.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the second thing that the church should not have.</S>
