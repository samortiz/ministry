   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE BOUNDARY OF TIMING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The elders must also be able to discern the timing of events.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some things can be done at a certain time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if the time is changed, the same things cannot be done any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some words can be spoken in one kind of meeting, but in another meeting, such words cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You cannot say that because a matter is announced in the prayer meeting it can therefore be released in the preaching meeting as well.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No. Here is a boundary of timing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In everything related to the elders, they have to maintain the boundary of timing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a matter is not done at a certain time, it can no longer be done.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to learn to consider the matter of timing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order for the elders to manage a church well, they have to keep to the boundary of timing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For instance, in the situation we just mentioned, that of a couple about to have a divorce, when the elders hear about it, they may want to visit them and to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when should they do it?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please remember that the timing is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The elders must study whether the matter has become open yet, and whether they can visit the couple in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps they should wait for another week and should watch the development of events.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there is no adequate consideration of the boundary of timing, the couple may be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They must draw clearly the boundary of time, so that when they go, it will be just the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In everything, there is the consideration of timing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even when a brother is sick, or has developed a problem with the church, or has been enticed by some sins, you cannot take a brother and visit him right away after you hear the news.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to consider the time factor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must find out what the most suitable time is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For some things the right time has passed, and there is nothing that can be done any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You should not try to do anything, or else the result will be even worse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You can only ask for the Lord's forgiveness for your dullness, that you have not caught the proper time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes, it is not right to do anything yet; you have to wait for a few days, or a period of time, and watch the development or the result, before you can make any contact.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If an elder indeed has a heart to shepherd God's flock and to build up Christ's Body, he will see the importance of timing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is like a physician who is preparing to operate on his patient; there is a question of timing involved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Any elder who cannot draw a boundary in the matter of timing will most certainly be unable to manage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the elders must also consider the matter of timing.</S>
