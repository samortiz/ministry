TRANSFORMATION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Result of Sanctification</H2><P>In the previous lesson we saw the matter of sanctification, the imparting of the divine life into our entire being. [When life is imparted into us, the result is transformation. It is similar to a chemical reaction caused by one element being added to another. The divine life brought into us through sanctification is a divine chemical element. When this element is imparted into our being, there is a reaction, and that reaction is transformation. Transformation means to change our nature, essence, appearance, tastes, and our whole being. Transformation is not outward change, correction, or adjustment; it is altogether an inward, metabolic change of our being.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. A Metabolic Change</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Discharging the Old Element<br>and Adding the New</H2><P>[In the physical body metabolism refers to the processes in cells by which old materials are discharged and new are added. This change, applied to the soul, is called in the New Testament transformation (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2). To apply makeup may result in a change in appearance, but it is merely an outward, not a metabolic, change. To have a better skin color because of an improved diet, on the other hand, is the result of a metabolic process. New elements are organically assimilated by the body, replacing the old. Transformation is a change in life, not merely in appearance. The divine element is added to us; this discharges the old human element. This organic change takes place in our soul.]</P>
