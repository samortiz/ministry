   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we need to see that the Spirit is also the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit is not the last third of God, nor is He just a power, or a dove; He is the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you receive the Spirit, you receive the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I. GOD BEING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 4:24 tells us that "God is Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Triune God is wholly a matter of Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This refers to God's essence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, the essence of a wooden table is wood, so we can say that the table is wood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's essence is Spirit, so we say God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Never think that only one-third of God is Spirit, as some may think.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Also, in John 15:26 the Lord said, "But when the Comforter comes, Whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality Who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First in 14:26 He says that the Father will send the Spirit; later in 15:26 He says that the Son Himself will send the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then who sent the Spirit the Father or the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must say that the Spirit was sent by both the Father and the Son because, as we saw in the last lesson, the Father and the Son are one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Father's sending is the Son's sending, and the Son's sending is the Father's sending.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit is sent not only by the Father but also "from-with" the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You should have learned from Lesson Three that the Greek word for "from" means "by the side of," and often means "from-with."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Father sends the Spirit, He comes with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Spirit comes from the Father and with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Father sends the Spirit, He comes with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Father is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son, so when the Spirit comes, the Father and Son also come.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The whole Triune God comes.</S>
