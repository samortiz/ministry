Paul wrote to Timothy, asking him to charge and exhort certain dissenting ones not to teach different things any longer
The Bible first shows us that God has two creations: one is the old creation and the other is the new creation
In the first section of God's old creation, which was His original creation, He created the heavens and the earth including the angels
Among them, an archangel, who was a cherub, led a group of them to rebel against God and thus became God's adversary
We dare to say this because when He was on the earth, He said, 'I am the life' , and He also said, 'I am the true vine'
When you put these two statements together, you can see that this Jesus as the God-man was a union of man with the life of God
Through His death He put an end to God's old creation, and through His resurrection He brought forth God's new creation
In His new creation God has resurrected that is has regenerated all His chosen ones together with Christ through the resurrection of Christ
At the same time, in His resurrection Christ also uplifted the humanity which He had put on and brought it into divinity
According to the teachings of the New Testament, the many sons of God and the firstborn Son of God are inseparable
The New Testament teachings are altogether on the matters concerning the firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God
In His resurrection and through His resurrection He brought forth, regenerated, all the ones in the new creation
They have all been set apart by the Holy Spirit and redeemed by God, and they have received Christ and have thereby become regenerated
Now this Spirit is the compound Spirit, the aggregate Spirit, and the consummation of the processed Triune God
Such a Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God works the Triune God into the entire being of the believers
The firstborn Son of God is the individual embodiment of God; we as the many sons of God are the corporate embodiment of God
What people call the church refers mostly to the gathering together of a group of believers of Christ to form an assembly
It is carried out through regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and eventually, glorification
We truly worship You today that You have brought us to the high peak of Your revelation to show us something which most people have not seen
Any kind of enterprise requires two steps: The first step is to make a product and the next step is to distribute it
When a company plans to manufacture something, first it has to make the product and then it has to promote the sale of the product
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
Without the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, there would be no possibility for God's economy to be accomplished or applied
The origination, the accomplishment, and the application of the economy of God cannot be separated from the Triune God
The name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is revealed at a particular time according to the need of a particular divine matter
At the time of God's incarnation, there was the need of the Holy Spirit for His flesh to be set apart and sanctified from the common things
After thirty-three and a half years, the Lord Jesus accomplished God's economy through His death and resurrection
When it was time for the application of God's economy, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were fully revealed
Remember that the Triune God is never an empty doctrine and has absolutely nothing to do with vain, theological doctrines
The Triune God is not for our doctrinal understanding or theological study but for Him to be experienced by us
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
If you have not experienced regeneration, you can never know that this God touches people that they may receive Him and be regenerated
We need to see that the application of God's economy is altogether by the Spirit, the last One of the Divine Trinity
Never consider that the Spirit is of no importance, thinking that as the last One among the three, He is not the 'head' but the 'tail'
Why is it that before the resurrection of Christ the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit was not revealed?
The consummating Spirit includes the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all consummated in the Spirit
It was after the resurrection of Christ that the consummated Spirit of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were revealed
The application is with the consummated Spirit-not merely the aggregate Spirit but the ultimately consummated Spirit
We must see that the Spirit of God in Genesis 1 did not have humanity, neither did the Spirit of Jehovah nor the Holy Spirit in Matthew 1
The Holy Spirit in Matthew 1 only brought divinity into humanity, but humanity had not yet entered into divinity
The Spirit of God became the consummated Spirit by passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection
He first put on humanity and then in His resurrection brought humanity into divinity; out of this came the life-giving Spirit
The Spirit of God became the life-giving Spirit by passing through the various processes with the various elements added
Obviously the Holy Spirit was there, and the Spirit of God also was there in Genesis 1, so how could it be that the Spirit was not yet?
The Spirit, who is revealed to us in 2 Corinthians 3, is carrying out the work of transformation in the believers
Exodus 30 is a record concerning the building of the tabernacle but in verses 2230 God suddenly charged Moses to make the holy anointing oil
The way was to take one hin of olive oil and compound it together with four spices; thus, the oil became an ointment
According to the Hebrew language, this is the power to guard against and repel the poison of insects and snakes
The Father planned the Son came to accomplish what the Father planned and in the Sons accomplishment the lifegiving Spirit was brought forth
God is one yet three, the three are one in resurrection, and then one became seven, the seven Spirits, for the church's need
In the seven Spirits there are God, man, the death of Christ with its effectiveness, and the resurrection of Christ with its power
The New Testament tells us that we should live and walk not only in the Spirit but also according to the spirit
We truly desire to live in You as such a God, that is, to live in the Spirit, according to Your heart's desire
When Christ brought us with Him in His death on the cross, He brought the entire old creation with Him to die there
We can either say that the Body of Christ is Christ, or we can say that the Body of Christ is all the members of the Body of Christ
Because He had the Spirit of holiness within Him, that Spirit enlivened Him out of death and designated Him the Son of God
Christ could be resurrected from the dead because He has the divine element in Him, and that divine element is the Spirit of holiness
When He lived in the flesh, a part of Him was merely man, merely the seed of David; that part was not the Son of God
Because His humanity was without sin and had never become fallen , His human part did not need to be redeemed but it needed to be uplifted
Our humanity consists of two parts: one part is the God-created part, and the other part is the fallen and corrupted part
God's salvation is altogether not a matter of religious improvement or a matter of moral and ethical improvement
If we did not have the Spirit of God within us, our rising out of the water would be in vain, having no reality of resurrection
We must see that teaching people merely according to the letter of Scriptures is not the Body of Christ; that is a religious work
Even we may preach the gospel zealously, but unless our gospel preaching is the issue of a God-man living, it is not the Body of Christ
The Body of Christ is a group of God-chosen people who have been redeemed and regenerated through death and resurrection
They have been united and mingled with God and have been living in this union all the time since their regeneration
May the Lord have mercy on us so that we can live a life of being conformed to the death of Christ through the cross
Only such a living is the God-man living, and only such a living can live out the reality of the Body of Christ
We have lived in the natural realm; we have lived in our religious understanding, our ethical understanding, and our own understanding
Very few in Christianity have a proper understanding of the term 'God-man'; some of them even oppose the use of this term
They reject not only the teaching concerning our being God-men but also the teaching concerning Christ's being a God-man
If you do not believe that Christ is a God-man, this is tantamount to not confessing that Christ has come in the flesh
They say that we are Christians, believers, and saints but not God-men, and that to say that we are God-men is blasphemy
The proper life of a Christ-pursuing God-man is also a life of pursuing to know the power of Christ's resurrection
The resurrection of the Lord Jesus means that he who believes into Him, even if he should die, shall live and even live forever
We still need to do our best to pursue to know the power of Christ's resurrection not only in revelation but also in experience
To experience the power of Christ's resurrection and be conformed to His death, we need to participate in His sufferings
Paul said, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
With Christ there is a mold, the mold of His life of thirty-three and a half years on the earth, which is the mold of the cross
The Lord Jesus told us, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
Although He was holy and without sin, He still denied Himself by putting Himself to death that God might live in Him and be lived out of Him
If we are willing to check in this way, we will see that ninety-nine percent of the things which we say to our wife should never be said
They are things which we speak out of ourself; they are not spoken by the indwelling God in us, but by our natural man
If we truly have this experience, regardless of what we say, we have the cross checking in us: 'Is this spoken through the cross?
Under that condition and situation he overcame the threatening of death and martyrdom and lived out Christ to magnify Him
Paul was able to live out that kind of life because he did it by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Paul said that we are approved and justified before God because we live, walk, and have our being according to the mingled spirit
If we engage in the above pursuits, the issue will be that we live out the processed and consummated Triune God
Christ passed through resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit; this Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God
If we live a life according to the preceding seven items, we live out not only the Triune God and Christ but also the consummated Spirit
When we thus live out the consummated Spirit, this is equivalent to living in the resurrection of the consummated Spirit
Today, in general, people have the term 'the Body of Christ,' yet very few know what the Body of Christ refers to
The Body of Christ is the issue of the God-man life lived out by all those who believe in and belong to the Lord as the new man
The Body of Christ is in the Triune God, in the pneumatic Christ, in the all-inclusive Spirit, and in resurrection
You need to be careful in your daily life to see whether you speak and act in resurrection or in your natural man
If you say something that is not nice, it is not in resurrection; if you say something nice, neither is it in resurrection
If we live in resurrection, this will become an unprecedented revival among all the Christ-pursuing God-men today
It will also be an unprecedented revival, a revival that has never occurred in the two-thousand-year history of the church
He is waiting for a group of overcomers to live in His Body in resurrection to be the means for Him to usher in His kingdom age
When the Son of Man comes, He will be looking for the overcomers on the earth, a group of people living in faith, but can He find them?
You can seldom see a brother who shows, in his attitude and expression, that he does not believe that he is but believes that only God is
May the Lord have mercy on us to make us the overcomers in the present age for Him to close this age and bring in His kingdom age
We pray that You would save us from speaking any unnecessary words and give us fresh words with fresh light, fresh vision, and fresh supply
We worship You from the depths of our being that You are and we are not; You are everything and we are nothing
He was already destroyed on the cross; we ask You to destroy his power of darkness and all the unclean spirits and demons
Draw a line around Your recovery with Your blood so that the enemy, Satan, cannot go even one step beyond the line which You have fixed
In the Bible the Body of Christ is referred to only in the Epistles of Paul; it is not even mentioned by the Lord Jesus in the Gospels
Because so many things are covered in these four Epistles, the readers of the Bible are easily distracted by them
All the salespersons have been trained to show the customers only one item at a time instead of showing many items all at once
The biggest problem with us who read the Bible is that we are often distracted by the great number of items dealt with in the Bible
When we study the Bible, we must learn one thing-we should grasp the main points of the Bible and not be distracted by many other items
You will see that among all the main points and items in Romans, the most important thing is the Body of Christ
We all know that Romans speaks first concerning man's sinfulness, then concerning God's justification, sanctification, etc
There is a connecting line through the Bible, and that is the Body of Christ, the consummation of which is the New Jerusalem
Romans, the first of the Epistles, begins with God's justification and eventually refers to the Body of Christ, yet only in a brief way
What 2 Corinthians tells us is that if we desire to have the Body of Christ, we must have the new covenant ministry
4:4 speaks of one Body and one Spirit ; it goes on to speak of one Lord and one Father, who is over all, through all, and in all
If there is only one Body without the Spirit, the Lord, and God the Father, this Body is not the genuine Body of Christ
We still have to see that all the members of the Body of Christ need to be perfected that they may grow up to maturity
In summary, the Body of Christ is dealt with in Ephesians 1 and 4, and the house of God is referred to in Ephesians 2
We have seen that the church has two aspects: One aspect is the Body of Christ and the other aspect is the house of God
When a man and a woman are joined together in marriage, children are brought forth through the process of life
One party is the Dweller, and the other party is the dwelling place; the Dweller and the dwelling place are mingled as one
Our meetings should not be forms and rituals; they should not be full of persons, events, and things without the Spirit
In our daily life we should have a strong spirit; we should not wait until we come to the meetings to exercise our spirit
After you get into your car, you and your wife with your children-the four of you-are already having a meeting
All orthodox students of the Bible acknowledge that the emphasis of verse 16 is not on Christ but on the church
The church is the great mystery of godliness, the manifestation of God in the flesh, and the pillar and base of the truth
Both the Body of Christ and the house of God are organic; both are hinged on the life of God and the Spirit of God
If we have this kind of meeting among us, this is indeed the manifestation of the Body of Christ, and this is where the house of God is
When people come into our midst, according to what 1 Corinthians 14:25 says, they will worship God, declaring that indeed God is among us
Enable us to have fellowship with one another show concern for one another and bear one anothers burden in You as the allpenetrating Spirit
All this requires us to cooperate with You by praying to You to touch Your throne and by presenting ourselves more to You
May You bring in more young people to receive the training that we may meet the great need in spreading to different places
The general condition both in the United States and in the Far East had more or less entered into dormancy; it was as if everyone was asleep
From 1984, several people began to spread the rumor that Brother Lee's ministry was off and that they would not follow any longer
It was not an accidental rebellion or a temporary dissension; rather, there was a long period of fermentation and an overall plan
That conference in Hong Kong was altogether the Lord's vindication; it was something carried out by the Lord Himself
Who could have nearly nine hundred people attending the meetings within such a period of time under such a difficult situation?
The work in the United States cannot depend solely on the training in the United States; it needs to be matched by the training in Taiwan
Just after two years, in the spring of 1991, there was a speaking within me, saying, 'Now is the time to go to Russia
Russia has a population of four hundred million and is now fully opened after seventy years under the control of the Communist Party
Some restrictions were imposed on the ones who were to be sent, and one of the restrictions was that they must be Caucasian Americans
We have to know that in the past centuries the international affairs on this earth were mainly directed by the Europeans and Americans
Since the Lord had no way to go on in Europe and America, He went to China in 1920 in the beginning of the twentieth century
China was unable to spread the Lord's recovery to the whole world for various reasons, one of which was the language problem
Brother Nee knew early on that the Lord's recovery had to come to the West, especially to the English-speaking world
The Lord raised up a small recovery on the virgin soil of China, but the general situation of the world kept changing
At the beginning there were at the most 350 to 500 people, and in less than five years the number reached 50,000
Within a short span of thirty years, the Lord's recovery has spread throughout the six continents with over 1,200 churches
Today the church in Auckland, New Zealand, has more than three hundred people; most of them are Chinese who migrated from Taiwan
There are not many saints in South Africa; there are more saints in Nigeria and in Ghana, West Africa, and in Kenya, East Africa
The Lord's recovery is continually spreading throughout the six continents on the whole earth, and the need everywhere is tremendous
In order to produce a large number of people, we must bring in young students; hence, the campus work is a must
You must pick up the talented ones, those who are college graduates and good in English, and bring them in to be properly trained
Today in the United States there are over two hundred churches scattered in different places; the work at the universities has also spread
Next year we will cover Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs, thereby concluding the life-study trainings on the entire Bible
After that, every winter and summer training, the Lord willing, we will specifically cover the crystallization of the main points
If you get into the depths of these portions, you will realize that both the house of God and the Body of Christ hinge on life and spirit
A local church must be in a condition that is full of life and spirit, a condition of living out the living God
In the meetings there is the need for the elders to take the lead, but all they need to say is that today we want to first read Ephesians 4
You do not need to tell the saints how to read the Scriptures, how one section should read one verse and another section read the next verse
All that is required is for the elders to make a simple announcement, and the rest should come out in a living way
Most of our meetings in the churches have not been freed from the dead and depressed condition of Christianity
We need to take the cross and live by the power of the resurrection of Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Today due to the progress in telecommunications and means of transportation, the geographic distances have been greatly reduced
We all need to catch up with the Lord's move and cooperate with Him for the fulfillment of His heart's desire in eternity
