To Be the Reality of the Pneumatic Christ</H2><P>This life-giving Spirit is the reality of the pneumatic Christ. The word pneuma in Greek means "spirit." Thus, the word pneumatic actually means "spiritual." Christ is the pneuma; therefore, He is very pneumatic. The English word pneumatic means "of or pertaining to air." Thus, to be pneumatic is to be full of air. Our Christ today is pneumatic, full of the heavenly, divine, spiritual air. Today we may go to a gasoline station to get gasoline, air, and water. Let us come to Christ as our "gasoline station" to get the spiritual gasoline, the spiritual air, and the spiritual water. We need these things in order to "drive" our spiritual "car." The life-giving Spirit is the reality of such a pneumatic Christ. Our Christ today is not physical but spiritual. He does have a physical body (Luke 24:39-43), but His body is spiritually physical (1 Cor. 15:44). Today Christ is pneumatic; He is the life-giving Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. For Propagation through Life-imparting</H2><P>This is for propagation, for producing, for spreading, through life-imparting. We are all parts of Christ. Before we were saved, we were not parts of Christ. Then the life-giving Spirit went along with the preaching of the gospel to impart Christ into us, and we were regenerated and became parts of Christ. This is Christ's spreading; this is Christ's propagation. In a real sense, we are not Americans, Chinese, Japanese, or Koreans. We are Christ's propagation; we are parts of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. As the Preeminent One<br>Becoming the Firstborn from among the Dead</H2><P>In His resurrection Christ, as the preeminent One, the One who has the first place in all things, became the Firstborn from among the dead (Col. 1:18; Rev. 1:5a). In 1 Kings 17 Elijah raised a widow's son, and in John 11 the Lord Jesus raised Lazarus. Since at least these two were resurrected before the Lord Jesus was, how could Jesus be considered the Firstborn from among the dead? The answer is that Elijah's raising of the widow's son and even the Lord Jesus' raising of Lazarus cannot be counted as resurrection in full, because after being resurrected, both of these resurrected ones died. However, the Lord Jesus was resurrected to live forever (Rev. 1:18). Not only so, in resurrection the Lord today is in glory. Neither Lazarus nor the one resurrected by Elijah entered into any kind of glory. But Jesus, when He came out of the tomb, entered into glory. He was not only resurrected, but His physical body was transfigured to become a spiritual physical body. This is a resurrection that is up to the standard. Before Jesus, no one experienced such a resurrection. Thus, He is the Firstborn from among the dead. This is the second item of the produce of Christ's resurrection.</P><P>Christ's resurrection, in which He became the Firstborn from the dead, was for the germination of God's new creation (Gal. 6:15; 2 Cor. 5:17) and also for Christ to be Head of the Body. In His resurrection, Christ became the Germinator of the new creation, and He also became the Head, the top One, of the Body. This too is the produce of His resurrection.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_272.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_274.html">Next</a> </body></html>
