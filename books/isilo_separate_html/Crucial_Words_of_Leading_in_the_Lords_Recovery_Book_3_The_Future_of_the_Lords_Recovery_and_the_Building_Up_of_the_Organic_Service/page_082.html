<p>We should demonstrate and explain how to advance the group meetings. Suppose a co-worker goes to lead and nurture a small group in which there are many sisters but only a few brothers. This co-worker should not give a long message; rather, he should consider the saints as a family and greet them with an intimate concern. He should also be aware of long pauses or gaps to avoid a dull and heavy atmosphere.</p>
<p>As a result of our meeting habits, many co-workers and elders like to formalize the small group meetings as if they are conducting a worship service. To them, a group meeting is merely a large meeting held with fewer people. If we eat the same food continually, even if it is good food, we will grow to dislike it. We are famous for having numerous church meetings. Our meetings can be compared to eating, and just as we need to eat three meals a day, we need to meet frequently. But if we eat dumplings three times a day for six months, dumplings will no longer be our favorite food. According to my understanding, nine out of ten saints come to the meetings only out of habit. Therefore, we must avoid bringing in the atmosphere of a large meeting into a small group meeting. In particular, we must avoid the habit of giving a message.</p>
<p>The most important part of a small group meeting is its beginning. We should not consider what to say at the beginning of the meeting. An opening word damages the meeting. A group meeting does not need an opening word, and it does not need our conventional way of meeting. Instead, we should chat with the brothers and sisters. The secret is to not consider the meeting as a special kind of meeting. We should simply be as if we are at home and chatting with the members of our family. There is no need to prepare a special topic for conversation. Once we prepare something, we ruin the meeting. We either fall into a worship service or mere formality. We might ask a saint, whom we have not met before, his name. We can also ask the saints about their interests, but we should be careful not to hold general conversations about things like the weather. Neither should the conversation center on one person; rather, everyone should be brought into the conversation. This is not a small matter; our ability to nurture a small group depends on such matters.</p>
<p>Our conversation with the saints should not be aimless. Perhaps after ten minutes of conversing, we will come to a turning point. At this juncture we can achieve our goal in leading the group by stirring up the saints. We should perfect them to serve. We should stir up their burden to restore the dormant saints. We should promote the gospel in the homes. We should also promote the community gospel.</p>
<p>We should not let the conversations continue aimlessly. Our purpose is to know the spiritual condition of the saints and then to fan into flame the gift that is within them. This depends on our skill and our spiritual sense. We need wisdom in the things we do. For example, it would be inappropriate to say, &ldquo;Our desire is not merely to get to know one another. It is more important for us to fan the gift within you into flame so that you are stirred up to serve the Lord.&rdquo; Such a speaking will be counterproductive.</p>
<p>We can compare the group meetings to playing basketball. After we dribble the ball, we must throw it into the basket. In other words, our conversation in the small group can be compared to dribbling a ball. At a certain point we should aim at the basket to make a score. We should not speak doctrine. On the contrary, we should exercise wisdom to lead the saints into the practical burdens for advancing the small group.</p>
<p>This is easy to say but not so easy to carry out. We often have meetings with no result, because we continually dribble the ball, but no one takes a shot at the basket. Those who serve the Lord have heard many messages, and some have given many messages. As a result, when they speak, they have the habit of giving a message. We all need to learn to shoot for the basket shortly after receiving the ball in order to attain our goal.</p>
<p>For example, concerning restoring the dormant saints, we may simply ask whether the saints know of other brothers and sisters in the neighborhood, and how they are doing. This is a simple and direct way to stir up the saints related to this goal. It will lead the saints to fellowship mutually. At an appropriate time, we can ask whether the dormant saints would come to the group meeting. This will also encourage the saints to fellowship. However, we must beware of falling into the trap of holding a drawn out discussion. As soon as every dormant saint in the neighborhood has been accounted for, we should wisely stop the conversation. At another time we should encourage everyone to pick up the burden to visit and restore the dormant saints. This is an easy way to help the group reach this goal. With such a good beginning, the group will be able to achieve many things, and we will not be beating the air. We will hit the mark.</p>
<p>The group meeting also needs a good ending. We should give every member of the group the feeling to pick up the burden. This will fan the gift within them into a flame. We should also help them take action. For example, if there was a conversation concerning a dormant sister who lives nearby, we should grasp the opportunity to ask whether some sisters have a burden to visit her. Surely some will have such a burden, and their response will prove that their spirit has been fanned into flame. Such meetings will enable everyone to be burning.</p>
<p>We do not have to consider this example as the best way. If we have better ways, we should fellowship and study them together. This example has no rituals, no routine worship, no regulations, and no formality. It has none of these things. We should simply let the saints come together in order to arrive at the goal of everyone in the group rising up to serve. We should always restore the dormant saints and then begin the gospel work.</p>
<p>Since the groups are formed according to where the saints live, a young sister might be assigned to a group with four elderly brothers and five elderly sisters. For this reason, the young saints who intend to serve full time must exercise to be bold. Furthermore, they must exercise to be calm but not timid. They should be able to keep their composure regardless of the situation.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, young sisters and even young brothers are afraid to function in front of others. There is a common Chinese saying that one can be a hero at home but a worm when he leaves home. The young ones need to be trained so that they are nothing at home but full of boldness when they meet with the saints. Everyone who serves the Lord must exercise boldness. This does not mean we should be bold to do bad things. Rather than being afraid of meeting people, we must be bold to speak for the Lord. For example, if we meet the president, on the one hand, we should respect him, but on the other hand, we should be bold, not timid, to speak to him. Unless we exercise in this matter, it will be difficult for us to serve the Lord. How can we serve the Lord if we are afraid to meet people or are afraid to speak when we meet people?</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to exercise to speak, but we should not speak like elementary students. Since we have a desire to serve the Lord, the young serving ones, especially the sisters, must learn to be bold. Being bold does not mean that we do anything we want or do things that we should not. Being bold means that we are not afraid to contact people nor are we afraid of any situation. Even if we are young, we should always be unperturbed. We should also learn not to speak like a child. Rather, we should be elegant, composed, and logical.</p>
<p>Since we desire to serve the Lord, we must contact people and we must speak. We must exercise in these few things. If we can learn them, we will advance.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_081.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_083.html">Next</a> </body></html>
