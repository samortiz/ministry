   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The believer who goes through such an experience thinks that his spirituality is at its highest when he has this experience and at its lowest when he loses it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A believer often speaks of his own life as constantly being up and down.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He means that his spirituality is at its highest when he feels happy, when he feels that he loves the Lord, and when he feels the Lord's presence; his spirituality is at its lowest when he feels dark, dry, and bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, he is spiritual when he can sense warmth in his heart and soulish when he feels cold.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A believer usually thinks in this way, but is it true?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These thoughts are based entirely on a misconception.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are not clear concerning this misconception, we will utterly fail.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The believer must know that "feeling" is forever a part of the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When he lives by his feeling, no matter how he feels, he is soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When he feels happy, when he feels he loves the Lord, and when he feels the Lord's presence, he is just living by his feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When he feels dry, sorrowful, and dark, he is still living by his feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is just as soulish when he feels dry, sorrowful, and dark as he is when he feels nourished, happy, and bright.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The spiritual life is never regulated by the feeling, nor is it ever in the feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The spiritual life should regulate the feeling; the feeling should not regulate the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today the experience of feeling is most commonly, but erroneously, regarded by believers as a spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many Christians have never entered into a spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the sensation of being filled with happiness is interpreted as a spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They do not know that it is simply soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Spiritual experience is the experience of the intuition; the rest is soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Herein lies the believer's greatest mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The effect of the emotion causes him to feel that he has ascended into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, he thinks that he is in possession of the ascended life, without realizing that this is just something which he feels.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When he feels the Lord's presence, he thinks he possesses the Lord; when he does not feel His presence, he thinks that the Lord has forsaken him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He does not realize that this is simply what he feels.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He thinks that he really loves the Lord when he senses a warm fire burning in his heart and feels that he loves the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he feels a coldness instead of a burning within, he thinks he has truly lost his love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He does not realize that this is only his feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Facts do not necessarily correspond with our feelings because our feelings are very unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, a believer is the same with or without a feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He may feel he is progressing when he is not; or he may feel he is regressing when he is not.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These are just his feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He thinks that he has progressed whenever he is full of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does not realize that because he is still soulish, he is merely advancing in a spurt of emotional excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When this feeling subsides, he remains the way he used to be.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The effect of the emotion helps a soulish person go on; the power of the Holy Spirit helps a spiritual man go on.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of the two, only the power of the Holy Spirit can truly cause a person to go on.</S>
