[This brings us to the parable of the leaven.]</p><p>The church, as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ, the unleavened fine flour, as its content, must be a loaf of unleavened bread (1 Cor. 5:7-8). However, the Catholic Church, which was fully and officially formed in the sixth century and which is signified by the woman here, took in many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ, leavening the whole content of Christianity. This mixture became the corrupted content of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. This fourth parable corresponds with the fourth of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the church in Thyatira (2:18-29)....Meal, for making the meal offering (Lev. 2:1), signifies Christ as food to both God and man. Three measures is the quantity needed to make a full meal (Gen. 18:6). Hence, the hiding of the leaven in three measures of meal signifies that the Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. This is the actual situation in the Roman Catholic Church. Such leavening is absolutely against the Scriptures, which strongly forbid putting any leaven into the meal offering (Lev. 2:4-5, 11).</p><p>The woman of Matthew 13 is the Jezebel of Revelation 2....Eventually this evil woman will become the great harlot, called Babylon the Great, seen in Revelation 17.... After the papal system had been established, the many pagan practices which had been brought in were confirmed by that system. This is documented in Alexander Hislop&#8217;s book, The Two Babylons.</p><p>Leaven is something added to make things easy to eat....Our natural being likes to use certain methods to make spiritual things easier to assimilate....Not only the Catholic Church has taken in leaven, but the Protestant denominations and groups have also. Rock music and drama are types of leaven....Using basketball for gospel preaching is also leaven....So many things in Christianity are leaven. These include Christmas, Easter, idols, pictures, images,...and the entire YMCA system....Whether or not people receive our word is a matter of the Father&#8217;s will. We do not want to use any gimmicks to help in our preaching. Every gimmick is leaven. We are not for a work or for a movement-we are for the testimony of Jesus....In [preaching the gospel], building up the church, and spreading the Lord&#8217;s testimony, the only way is to pray and to minister the pure Word. In the eyes of God, any gimmick-anything other than Christ, the Word, prayer, and the Spirit-is leaven.</p><p>We must see the difference between the reality of the kingdom and the appearance of the kingdom. The reality is precious to God, but the appearance is abominable to Him. Therefore, we must treasure the reality and reject the appearance. We do not like the tares, the big tree, or the rottenness. We care for the pure wheat flour and the little mustard herb which are good for food. This is the church&#8217;s testimony, which is food to God and man....Many of us can testify that we were hungry for years, but that once we came into the church, we were satisfied....This is the Lord&#8217;s recovery, and this is the dining table.
