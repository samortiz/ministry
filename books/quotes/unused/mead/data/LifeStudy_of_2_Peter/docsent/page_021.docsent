   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SELF-CONTROL, ENDURANCE, AND GODLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 6 Peter goes on to say, And in knowledge self-control, and in self-control endurance, and in endurance godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Self-control is the exercise of control over the self in its passions, desires, and habits.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our knowledge we need to develop such a self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our self-control we need to develop endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Self-control is related to the self, but endurance is related to others and to our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As to ourselves, we must have self-control, and as to our circumstances, no matter what they may be, we need endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to have endurance with the members of our family, with our neighbors, and with various things that disturb us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, when you are bothered by something in your environment, you need endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to develop endurance in order to bear with others and with our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 6 Peter also says that in our endurance we need to develop godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Godliness means God-likeness, that is, being like God and expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Christian life should be a life that expresses God and bears God s likeness in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we exercise control over the self and bear with others and with circumstances, we also need to develop godliness so that we may be like God and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE NEED FOR A NOBLE LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 7 Peter goes on to say, And in godliness brotherly love, and in brotherly love love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have pointed out that in godliness, the expression of God, brotherly love, which is brotherly affection, needs to be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have also seen that the Greek word for love in verse 7 is agape, the word used in the New Testament for the divine love, which God is in His nature 1 John 4:8, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of love is nobler than brotherly love, and it is stronger in ability and greater in capacity than human love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The brothers and sisters in the church life may love one another, but their love may be rather superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In their love there may be no life supply and no antibiotic to foster healing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that their love is lacking in agape.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in Peter s love for the brothers there is another element, and this element is the divine love, a love that supplies us with wisdom to love the brothers in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes we love others foolishly, in a way that can spoil them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not have the wisdom to love them in a way that will enable them to receive the life supply and be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s love is not only nourishing, but also contains a spiritual antibiotic that fosters healing and prevents illness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we love the brothers with divine love, we shall infuse such an antibiotic into them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, you may realize that a brother has a certain shortage or weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You know that teaching or correction will not help the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This brother needs to be loved with a noble love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you love him with this kind of love, he will receive the life supply and an antibiotic that can kill the germs within him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the church life we need to love one another with discernment, not foolishly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to love the brothers with the high purpose of nourishing them and helping them to be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Love with Discernment</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s love is always with discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Matthew 5:45 tells us that God sends rain upon both the just and the unjust.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But He does this with wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes He may withhold rain from a certain region.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This does not mean that He does not love the people in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He loves them, but He loves them with discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Likewise, we should not withhold love from the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should love all the brothers, but we should love them with discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our love for the saints should also always be according to a measure or within a limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we love a brother excessively, that love may spoil him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to love him only to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But another brother may be in need of a greater measure of love.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To love others in this way is to love them not merely with brotherly affection but also with agape.</S>
