   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse indicates that not only Paul, but also the Corinthians were mourning concerning a certain situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the aspect of mourning is developed in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>MEEKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The third seed of the reality of the kingdom sown in Matthew is meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matthew 5:5 says, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 4:2 develops the matter of meekness: "With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This verse mentions not only meekness but also lowliness with longsuffering and bearing with one another in love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is much more than simply meekness; it indicates some rich development.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Titus 3:2 says, "To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness unto all men."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The gentleness and the showing all meekness unto all men is a development of the meekness in Matthew 5:5.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>HUNGERING AND THIRSTING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The seed of hungering and thirsting for righteousness is developed in 1 Timothy 6:11: "But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is further developed in 2 Timothy 2:22: "Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, love lit.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse indicates that even the showing of mercy is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christians have never considered this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From the context of Romans 12, showing mercy is listed as a gift along with teaching, leading, exhorting, and prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this chapter even the extending of hospitality to guests is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Both showing mercy and giving hospitality are gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Finally, Colossians 3:12 says, "Put on therefore as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering."</S>
