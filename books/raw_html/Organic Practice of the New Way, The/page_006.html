 <h2 class="head1">EXERCISING IN THREE THINGS</h2>
<p>You need to be a living person, and your prophesying needs to be living. In short, you must be a person who seeks after the Lord and loves Him. At the same time, you must exercise yourself in three things: (1) prayer, (2) living Christ, and (3) fellowship. In Acts chapter six, the twelve apostles gathered the disciples together and said, &ldquo;But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (v. 4). Acts 2:42 also says that from the day the three thousand were baptized, &ldquo;they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.&rdquo; Therefore, in order for your prophesying to be living, you must first be a person of prayer. You must also be a person who seeks after life, living daily in the spirit, and having the proper testimony in your daily life. This testimony is not merely one of being a nice person, living properly according to ethics and morality, but the testimony of one who walks according to the spirit in everything in your daily life and who lives Christ all day long.</p>
<p>In addition, you must be a person who knows how to fellowship in the church. Everything that has to do with your Christian life or church service should be brought into fellowship. Today, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has spread to the whole world. Due to the convenience in traffic, communication is frequent among the churches. The elders should have the discernment and the proper fellowship so that false ones will not come in. From my youth, I have received the training to fellowship in everything. I have always kept this principle of fellowship.</p>
<p>In your fellowship you have to learn to be honest and to speak in a genuine way. When someone asks you about the condition of a certain brother, you should fellowship the truth. You should not brush the matter aside. You have to realize that our fellowship is not a matter of finding out other people&rsquo;s faults. Rather it is to perfect others and to build up the church through this kind of fellowship. In this way, everyone will receive the benefit.</p>
<p>If you will spend six days a week to learn the Lord&rsquo;s word this way and will be a praying person, living Christ, and bringing everything into fellowship, when you stand up to speak, your speaking will surely be living and organic. In the district meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, you will surely be able to prophesy and will build up the saints and the church. All these require your learning and practice.</p>
