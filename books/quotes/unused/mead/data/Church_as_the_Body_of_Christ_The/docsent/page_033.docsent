   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE FIVE ITEMS CONCERNING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 2:15, 20-21</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians presents several aspects of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter 1 shows that the church is the Body of Christ v. 23 . Chapter 2 shows that the church is a dwelling place, a building vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Chapter 5 shows that the church is a wife to match a husband vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>25-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Chapter 6 shows that the church is a fighter, a warrior vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>10-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, Ephesians gives four different expressions concerning the church: the Body, the dwelling place, the wife, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Body is also spoken of in Romans and 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The dwelling place, the building, is seen in 1 Corinthians 3 and in 1 Peter 2 as well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning the church, Revelation 12:1 speaks of a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This woman symbolizes the totality of God s people on earth, including the church in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then in chapter 21, concerning the New Jerusalem, we see the bride of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, in Revelation the church is both the wife of the Lamb and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, there are five items concerning the church: the Body, the dwelling place, the wife, the warrior, and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although these five items are different, they have a common characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>FIVE ITEMS CONCERNING THE CHURCH The Body</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We know that a body is for the expression of a head.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The head is expressed through the body, and it also lives and moves through the body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do not have a body, we cannot express ourselves, nor can we live and move.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ the Head can express Himself, live out Himself, and do what He desires in the universe only through the church as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we must remember three points when we speak of the Body: the Body is for expression, living, and moving.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our Lord has accomplished His redemptive work and is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, He is still expressing Himself, living out Himself, and ushering in His move and work on earth through the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the church as the Body of Christ is the continuation of Christ in time and the spread of Christ in space Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For two thousand years Christ has been visible on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, this Christ is not the individual Christ but the universal Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is because in His ascension He has obtained a universal Body that exists in time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through such a universal Body Christ expresses Himself, lives out Himself and moves and works in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Dwelling Place</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A dwelling place is where a person resides and rests.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s dwelling place is where He resides and finds rest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we understand the Bible and touch God s heart, we will sense that in Genesis God was searching for a dwelling place; He could be compared to a homeless person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Genesis 1 and 2 God did not seem to have a resting place, a home where He could reside.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we touch God s feeling in the Scriptures, we will sympathize with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although God has the heavens as His dwelling place in the universe, this does not satisfy His heart s desire; He needs a dwelling place more suitable to His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Exodus the thought of God s need for a dwelling place was revealed after He saved the Israelites out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God commanded Moses to build a tabernacle for Him to dwell in 25:8-9 ; this tabernacle signifies man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the condition of the Israelites was proper before God, He had a resting place among them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the Scriptures, David was a man according to God s heart Acts 13:22 ; he understood God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>David s desire to find a resting place for Jehovah was most pleasing to God Psa 132:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In David s time, the Ark, which represented God, was separated from the tabernacle 1 Sam 4:22 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Ark was like a man wandering without a resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>David eventually brought the Ark back 2 Sam 6:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When he was dwelling in a house of cedar, he remembered God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>David was reminded that God did not have a dwelling place and desired to build a dwelling place for God because God did not have a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This desire was pleasing to God 7:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now God desires to work in a group of people through grace to make them into a dwelling place vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>During David s time, God did not allow him to build His dwelling place by his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Solomon, the son of David, built the temple for God 1 Kings 6 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the building of the temple was completed, the glory of God filled the temple 8:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At this time God was exceedingly joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the New Testament God has a spiritual dwelling place, which is the church Eph 2:22; 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today God has a dwelling place on earth, a place where He can settle down.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This place is the church, which is according to His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The New Jerusalem, the tabernacle of God among men, will be manifested in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God will tabernacle with man eternally, settle down in man, and enjoy rest with man eternally Rev 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, God s dwelling place is where God finds rest.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church is such a dwelling place to God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Where should people go to find God today?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They should go to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can find and meet God only when we come to the church, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The church is God s dwelling place, the place where God resides.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Wife</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church is the wife of Christ, the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church as the wife of Christ matches Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Genesis 2:18 God said that it is not good for man to be alone; this word reveals God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God felt that it was not good for Him to be alone; He needed a counterpart, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christ needs the church to be His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we see the husband of a couple, we are seeing only half of the couple; there is another half.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Both a husband and a wife need to be together to be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For example, if a gourd is cut into two, neither half is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Likewise, if a watermelon is cut into two, neither half is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is not complete until both halves are together.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the same way, without man as His match, God is short of His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This means that without the church, Christ is short of His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God built the woman in Genesis 2 to match Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The church matches Christ as His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If there is no church, Christ is short of His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the universe, God has been longing to find a counterpart for His Son, Christ; that counterpart is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The church is the bride of Christ to match Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Warrior</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The church as a warrior is for fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The warrior in Ephesians 6 is not an individual saint but the corporate church.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The armor in verses 10 through 20 is for the Body, not for an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>No spiritual believer as an individual can richly experience all the items of the armor.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When John Bunyan wrote Pilgrim s Progress, the light concerning the church was not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Therefore, he likened the warrior in Ephesians 6 to an individual saint.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The warrior in chapter 6 is the church, not an individual; the armor is also a corporate armor, not the armor for an individual saint.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Only the church in oneness can experience all the riches of the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God has been hindered from carrying out His purpose by His enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Therefore, in order to accomplish His will, God needs to deal with His enemy through warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Ephesians shows how the church fights for God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God deals with His enemy through the church in order to accomplish His will.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Therefore, the church is a spiritual warrior, fighting for God to accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The City</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The city is the aggregate of the four previously mentioned items: the Body, the dwelling place, the wife, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The city is the Body of Christ throughout eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Christ will be expressed through the city and live in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The city is an enlarged dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In this age, the church is a dwelling place, a temple for God to dwell in; in eternity, this dwelling place will be enlarged, becoming a city.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The city is the bride of Christ; the bride and the city are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The city is a warrior, but in eternity, when God s enemy is completely dealt with, there will be no darkness, no death, and no need for fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The city is an aggregate of the many statuses of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In relation to authority, when the city is manifested, authority will be fully manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Authority can be seen in the Body, the dwelling place, the wife, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Especially during warfare, anyone who cannot submit to authority has no place as a warrior; soldiers must submit absolutely to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In addition, a city implies ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In the holy city, New Jerusalem, God s authority is firmly established; the throne of God with His authority is in the city Rev 22:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>God reigns over the nations through this city, and this city is where God executes His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The Lord s reigning forever and ever is also a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Therefore, the city denotes God s authority and ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We need to see that the Body, the dwelling place, the bride, and the warrior are for the exercise of authority; these items have one goal, the establishment of God s authority so that God s glory can be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In Revelation 21 22 God s authority is as secure as the city.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This is accomplished through God s building work throughout the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>In this city there is the throne of God, signifying God s authority, and there is the life of God as its content.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Everything of God is in this city; God can move and rule to express Himself in this city.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Through this ruling, God s glory can shine forth, and God will bring the whole universe into harmonious order so that the whole universe can express God s glory in an orderly manner.</S>
