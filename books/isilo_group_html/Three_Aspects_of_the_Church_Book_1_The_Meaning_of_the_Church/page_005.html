<p>Second, God not only uses Himself as the resource to produce the church, but He also uses His power as the energy. Ephesians 1:19 says, &ldquo;What is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength.&rdquo; Verse 20 tells us that this power is the power that God used to raise Christ from the dead. Ephesians 3:20 says, &ldquo;To Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us.&rdquo; This power is not merely the power of creation but also the power of resurrection. The power of resurrection encompasses and transcends the power of creation. According to the Scriptures God is the One who calls the things not being as being and gives life to the dead (Rom. 4:17). To call the things not being as being involves His creation, and to give life to the dead involves His resurrection. Both involve power; however, the power of creation is included in the power of resurrection. When we speak of the power of resurrection, we are speaking of a power that includes all the power of God. God takes the power of resurrection as the energy for the carrying out of His economy related to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Wisdom of God</h2>
<p>Third, in order for God to produce the church, He needs not only the resource (the material) and the energy (the power) but also a means. This is similar to building a house; we need materials, energy, and means. The means by which God carries out His economy related to the church is His wisdom. Ephesians 3:10 says, &ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.&rdquo; In addition, Colossians 2:3 says, &ldquo;In whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.&rdquo; These verses show that God uses His wisdom to produce the church.</p>
<p>In summary, in carrying out His economy for the church, God uses Himself as the resource, His power and might as the energy, and His wisdom as the means. First Corinthians 1:24 says, &ldquo;Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&rdquo; If we know God&rsquo;s economy, our speaking regarding Ephesians and Colossians would not be the same. The Greek word for <em>economy</em> is used three times in Ephesians. In 3:2 the apostle Paul mentions the &ldquo;stewardship of the grace of God&rdquo; which had been given to him. The word <em>stewardship</em> is the same as <em>economy</em> in Greek. God&rsquo;s establishing of the apostle Paul as a steward was part of the economy of His grace. Hence, this Greek word is used three times in Ephesians, and each of these instances points to the economy related to the church. God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s plan for the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Eternal</h2>
<p>The church was in God&rsquo;s plan in eternity, before the creation of the world and all things, before the beginning of time. In eternity past God had such a plan. Ephesians 3:11 calls this plan His eternal purpose, His eternal plan. This plan was made not only in eternity but also for eternity. For us human beings there are an eternity past and an eternity future. God&rsquo;s plan was made in eternity past, and it is for eternity future. In other words, in eternity past God drew a blueprint of the church just as if He were drawing the blueprint of a house. Now in time, God is building His church according to this blueprint. This is the period of building. The completion of the building will be in the New Jerusalem. In eternity future this building will be finished.</p>
<p>A heavenly pattern existed in eternity past, but God is carrying out His building work in time. Before He began building, God first prepared the materials. In God&rsquo;s building there are two procedures: the first is the preparation of the material; the second is the actual building work. The materials are first prepared, and then God begins the building. God&rsquo;s creation, in which He called the things not being as being, is related to the preparation of the materials. His giving life to the dead is related to His building work. Hence, God is first manifested as the God of creation and then as the God of resurrection. This is the God in whom Abraham believed. The God in whom Abraham believed is the One who called the things not being as being and who gives life to the dead. To call the things not being as being is God&rsquo;s creation, and to give life to the dead is His building. In time, God first created, and then He carried out the work of death and resurrection. God prepares the materials and then builds. (See the diagram below.)</p>
<p>Having been created by God, we are all materials for the building of the church. However, if there was only creation without resurrection, there would be materials but no building. Only when the materials pass through death and resurrection can God&rsquo;s building come into existence. Hence, the amount we experience death and resurrection equals the amount of God&rsquo;s building. If we never pass through death and resurrection, we will remain as natural materials that have not been built into the church as the spiritual house. For us to be built into the church as the spiritual house, we must pass through death and resurrection.</p>
<p>A person who is a descendant of Adam, who has not believed in the Lord, has been created by God but is absolutely not part of the church. He is merely a piece of building material. If at any time he passes through death and resurrection, the uncreated element of God will be mingled with his created element, and he will become a part of the church. Based on this principle, we can infer that even though we have been saved, we still have many natural things in us that belong to Adam, things we were born with that have not passed through death and resurrection. In other words, these natural things are raw materials that have not been built up. We will be built up as the church only when death and resurrection gain more ground in us through an increase in our experience of the cross and in our knowledge of resurrection.</p>

<p>In eternity past God planned the blueprint for the church, and in eternity future God will gain the church as a spiritual house. In time two steps are needed for God to fulfill His eternal plan: creation and redemption. Redemption includes both death and resurrection. According to its literal meaning, redemption does not include death and resurrection; however, according to spiritual fact, the main points of redemption are death and resurrection. In creation, God created the first creation; in redemption, God accomplished the second creation. As a result of Satan&rsquo;s corruption, the first creation became what the Bible calls the old creation; through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, the second creation became what the Bible calls the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15).</p>
<p>The old creation is in Adam, and the new creation is in Christ. The old creation in Adam is natural, and the new creation in Christ is spiritual. When what is natural becomes spiritual, God&rsquo;s building is completed. The old heavens and old earth are the universe in the old creation; the new heavens and new earth are the universe in the new creation. When the new heavens and the new earth appear, everything of the old creation will become new. At that time everything that is natural will have become spiritual. The new universe will have the New Jerusalem as its center. The New Jerusalem is the eternal building that God in His eternal plan desires to build, and it is the ultimate manifestation of the church. Hence, God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church existed in eternity past and is for eternity future.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 1, The Meaning of the Church &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
