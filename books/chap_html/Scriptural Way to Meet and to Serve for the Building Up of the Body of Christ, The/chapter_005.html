<h1 class="title">THE TRADITIONAL WAY<br />
TO MEET AND TO SERVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:6; Eph. 4:12b, 15-16</h1>
<p>In the last chapter we considered several points concerning the traditional way to meet and serve. These points include the following: the traditional way adopts the way of human society for religion&mdash;&ldquo;in the customs of the nations&rdquo; (2 Kings 17:8, NASB); the traditional way is natural, fitting man&rsquo;s natural and fallen condition; the traditional way does not require man to be living and in the spirit; and the traditional way is religious. In this chapter we shall consider some other points concerning the traditional way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACCOMMODATING THE DEAD MAN&rsquo;S TASTE</h2>
<p>The traditional way of meeting accommodates the dead man&rsquo;s taste. Many of us who were in the traditional way in Christianity for a number of years can recall what we saw there. I attended Christianity services from my youth. I saw many people who were dead spiritually. The so-called church service just accommodated these dead people. Many of them were happy because they had a kind of social life which they called the church. Week after week, Sunday after Sunday, a certain portion was read from the Bible as a subject, yet year-round there was no change in the people. They simply attended services every Sunday.</p>
<p>That is the situation of Christianity, and we came out of it. But I observed that gradually, unknowingly, unintentionally, and unconsciously, we were drifting back to a similar situation. By 1984 I fully realized that our meetings were somewhat accommodating the dead situation of the traditional way. The saints came to the meetings with little exercise. The ones who gave the messages were nearly in a similar situation. I observed how the leading ones discussed and decided who was to give the message in the Sunday morning meeting. Eventually, someone was selected as a &ldquo;victim&rdquo; and charged to share the message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. That day became a sad day for the one selected. Was there a burden for the Sunday morning meeting? Quite often the one selected really did not have a burden. Why did the speaker speak? Why did the church have that meeting? Those meetings were held as a routine. We felt that we had to have this kind of meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to maintain the church&rsquo;s situation. Not many had a real burden for the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting, and most of the attendants came to the meeting as a matter of routine.</p>
<p>Some places may have been different, but many of the elders admitted that the church where they were had entered into a dormant situation. The church had become dormant, yet they still kept certain meetings. All of the meetings had become, to a large extent, a kind of routine. The attendants went in a routine way, without much burden. This corresponds to the dead situation. Yet this kind of situation existed among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States after twenty-two years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WAY OF MIXTURE</h2>
<p>The traditional way is also a way of mixture, mixing the fleshly with the spiritual and the heavenly with the earthly. Look at the situation of the Sunday services in Christianity today. Too many fleshly activities are merged into the spiritual things, and quite an amount of earthly element is blended with the heavenly things. Such a mixture began with Catholicism since Constantine the Great made Christianity a universal religion in the Roman Empire, as prophesied by the Lord Jesus in the parable of leaven in Matthew 13:33. This kind of contaminating and corrupting leaven has never been purged out in all the Protestant denominations, and the sad thing is that no denomination has the sincere intention to purge it out.</p>
