   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FIVE THE PREPARATION OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMANITY WITH HIS DIVINITY 3 Scripture Reading: Luke 1:57-80</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Luke 1:5 4:13 is a section concerned with the preparation of the Man-Savior in His humanity with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this section we have already covered the conception of John the Baptist, the Lord s forerunner 1:5-25 , and the conception of the Man-Savior 1:26-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we shall go on to consider the birth and youth of the forerunner of the Man-Savior 1:57-80 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we have begun to see, the preparation of the Man-Savior is in His humanity with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In principle, His preparation is the same as His conception, for in both the conception and the preparation we have the divine essence and the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The conception of the Man-Savior was of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence in the womb of a human virgin with the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, the Lord s conception was of the divine essence in the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, His preparation was in His humanity with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How excellent, marvelous, and extraordinary is this preparation!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1:5 2:52 we have the conception, birth, and youth of John the Baptist and that of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have pointed out that the conception of John the Baptist and that of Jesus the Savior are different in essence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The conception of John was God s miracle, accomplished with the overaged human essence, simply by the divine power without the divine essence being involved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the result of this conception was simply a man, one who was filled with the Spirit of God 1:15 but who lacked the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The conception of the Man-Savior was God s incarnation, constituted not only by the divine power, but also of the divine essence added to the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, this conception produced the God-man, the One with two natures divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>HIS FORERUNNER S BIRTH Born of His Mother Miraculously</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John the Baptist was born of his mother miraculously.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Concerning this miraculous birth, 1:57 and 58 say, Now the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth to give birth, and she brought forth a son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Circumcised on the Eighth Day</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Man-Savior s forerunner was circumcised on the eighth day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And it came about on the eighth day that they came to circumcise the young child v. 59 . This was according to the requirement in Leviticus 12:3.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Named John Miraculously</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When some were about to call the forerunner of the Man-Savior by the name of his father, Zachariah, his mother answered and said, No, but he shall be called John 1:59-60 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then some went on to say, There is no one of your relatives who is called by this name v. 61 . When they gestured to Zachariah as to what his child should be called, he wrote on a tablet, John is his name v. 63 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1:13 Zachariah was told by the angel that Elizabeth would bear a son and that he would call his name John.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Greek word rendered John is Ioannes, meaning Jehovah is favorable, Jehovah shows grace, or Jehovah is the gracious Giver.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The people were right in saying that none of Elizabeth s relatives was named John.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord s forerunner was given this name because he was to be one who would not keep the traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason, he was not given a traditional name, but he was given a new name.</S>
