<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Mingling of the Processed<br>and Consummated Triune God<br>with His Redeemed, Regenerated, Transformed,<br>Conformed, and Glorified Tripartite People</H2><P>The New Jerusalem is the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite people. This aspect of the New Jerusalem brings us to the central point of the divine dispensing. In order to be mingled with us, God had to be processed. The processed Triune God is the One who has gone through incarnation, human living, an all- inclusive death, and a wonderful resurrection. These are four steps, four processes. For God to be mingled with us, He also needs to be consummated. He was perfect in eternity, but He was not complete in what He wanted to be. He wanted to be God mingled with man. He wanted to be both divine and human. In eternity past was He complete? He was divine, but not divine and human. Thus, He was perfect and without defect, but not complete. He needed to be completed, to be consummated.</P><P>He became consummated by being processed. He became a man, lived a human life, and entered into death. We may think that His entering into death was merely a suffering. It was a suffering, but it was also a marvelous process. The eternal God who is the divine life, the uncreated life, the indestructible life, entered into death. Would you like to travel through death? God desired to do this, and He did it. He traveled through death. He took a tour of Hades. To God this was wonderful because this was His process. Then He entered into resurrection and transcended to the heavens in His ascension. Now He is there as both the perfect and complete God. Today He is not only perfect but also complete. He has been consummated with incarnation, with human living, with a wonderful death, with resurrection, and with ascension. He is completed. He has been consummated.</P><P>Such a God, a processed and consummated God, is absolutely qualified and ready to mingle Himself with His people so that they can be redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified. God today is not so simple and neither are we. God is completed, and we are enjoying Him as the consummated One. One day we will be consummated. That consummation will be the glorification, the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body of humiliation into the body of Christ's glory (Phil. 3:21). We will be the same as He is. He has passed through all the processes, and we will also pass through all the processes of redemption, regeneration, transformation, conformation, and eventually glorification. We have been redeemed and regenerated. Now we are passing through the "tunnel" of transformation. Eventually we will pass through the processes of conformation and glorification. Our God is the processed and consummated Triune God, and we are the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, glorified tripartite man. He mingles with us, and we mingle with Him to be one. The New Jerusalem is not merely God or merely man. The New Jerusalem is a God- man in the corporate way. The New Jerusalem is a mingling of the processed, consummated Triune God with the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite man. He is triune, we are tripartite, and we are mingled with Him.</P>
