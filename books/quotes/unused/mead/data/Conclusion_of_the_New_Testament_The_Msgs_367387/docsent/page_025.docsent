   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST IN THE EPISTLES 81</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the One better than Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>h.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Able to Save to the Uttermost</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those Who Come Forward to God through Him,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Seeing He Is Always Living to Intercede for Them</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hebrews 7:25 tells us that Christ is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here the expression to the uttermost means completely, entirely, perfectly, to the end, and for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that Christ as our High Priest is able to save to the fullest extent, that is, to save in every kind of situation and condition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ as our High Priest undertakes our case by interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He appears before God on our behalf and prays for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should believe that Christ is always interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By interceding for us, He takes care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He can take care of us much better than we could ever take care of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most of the time we are foolish in the way that we care for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Instead of trying to take care of ourselves by our own efforts, we should simply give ourselves to Him and rest, knowing that He is always caring for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1 Being Able to Save to the Uttermost</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 25 tells us that Christ is able to save to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because He lives forever without any change, Christ is able to save us to the uttermost in extent, in time, and in space.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, His salvation reaches to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ can save us to the uttermost because He is living not only in the heavens but also within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While He is living in the heavens, He is transmitting Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is living in the heavens to intercede for us and take care of our case, but the reality of this is transmitted into our spirit by His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must learn to see this heavenly vision and enjoy our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we will receive mercy and find grace at the throne of grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We will be delivered and saved to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the work of our divine High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because He has this kind of priesthood, He is able to save us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are not saved to the uttermost, it does not mean that He is not able to save.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, it means that we were not willing to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have no excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are willing to be saved, surely He will save us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the Scriptures, there are three aspects of the priesthood: the aspect of the Aaronic priesthood, the aspect of the kingly priesthood, and the aspect of the divine priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Aaronic aspect of the priesthood is for offering sacrifices to God for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the Aaronic priesthood is mainly concerned with the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The kingly aspect of the priesthood is for ministering the processed God to us as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The aspect of the divine priesthood is for saving us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we have three words to describe the three aspects of the priesthood: offering for the Aaronic aspect, ministering for the kingly aspect, and saving for the divine aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Offering solves the problem of sin, ministering imparts the processed God to us as our daily supply, and saving rescues us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The saving of the divine priesthood rescues us especially from death and all the environment of death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At this point, we need to consider why there is the need for the third aspect of the priesthood, the divine priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although sin is over, it caused a tremendous result death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Romans 5, the issue of sin is death v. 12 . We should not understand death according to the narrow view of our human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the broadest understanding of death in the Bible, death includes vanity, corruption, sighing, groaning, and decay.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everything is decaying.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may have a strong body, but before too long it begins to decay.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The matters of vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, and decay are fully developed and covered in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Romans 5 we have sin and death; in Romans 8 we have vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, and decay.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The whole universe has been polluted by death, which is the result of the sin that came in through Adam, the head of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The pollution that comes from death is corruption, vanity, decay, and groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Romans 8:22 says that the whole creation is groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every person is groaning deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since people want to escape from this groaning, they partake of worldly entertainments.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even after indulging in these entertainments, they find that the inward groaning is still there.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This groaning is one of the issues of death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because of the issues of death, we need the divine priesthood, which is the presence of life and the absence of death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He will save us from all our corruption, vanity, groaning, and decay.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When others come to our home, there should be praising, reality, building up, and growth, not groaning, vanity, corruption, and decay.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To be saved from these issues of death is what it means to be saved to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is more than the saving of the Savior it is the saving of the divine priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Greek word translated uttermost in Hebrews 7:25 has the same root as the Greek word for perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, to be saved to the uttermost means to be saved into perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christ saves us into His perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To be saved to the uttermost is to be brought into Christ s perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Son of God was incarnated, lived on earth, passed through death, was resurrected, and has been fully perfected forever.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This means that in His perfection there is no groaning, vanity, corruption, bondage, or decay.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In Christ, the perfected Son of God, the One who has been resurrected and uplifted, there is no groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Within Him there is no vanity, bondage, corruption, or decay.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is absolutely free from these things.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Vanity, groaning, decay, bondage, and corruption are all by-products of death.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ, the perfected One, is able to save us from all of these by-products of death and to bring us into His perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the saving to the uttermost, the saving to perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the saving of the divine priesthood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>While Christ was on earth, He solved the problems of sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As we are enjoying His kingly priesthood, we participate in the divine priesthood that diminishes and even swallows up all of the by-products of death.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>While we enjoy God being ministered into us as the processed One, we partake of the divine priesthood that diminishes, eliminates, and swallows up all of the by-products of death, such as vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, and decay.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Day by day there is within us a diminishing, a swallowing up, of our groaning and vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The more we participate in the divine priesthood of Christ, the less groaning we have.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The more we enjoy the divine priesthood of Christ, the less we will sigh and the more we will shout.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>According to Romans 8, the last step of God s work on us is to glorify us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To be glorified is to be thoroughly saturated with the divine priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we have been thoroughly saturated with the divine priesthood, that will be our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To be glorified is also to be delivered from vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, and decay.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is exactly the meaning of glorification in Romans 8 the full sonship, the redemption of our body v. 23 . The redemption of our body is its being transfigured out of vanity, corruption, and decay into a stage in which it is completely filled with the divine priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>That will be our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Aaronic priesthood is in Romans 3 and 4, the kingly priesthood is in Romans 6 and in the first part of Romans 8, and the divine priesthood is in the middle and the last part of Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Hebrews 7 does not correspond with Romans 3 or 4; it firstly corresponds with Romans 6 and the first part of Romans 8, and eventually it corresponds completely with the middle and the last parts of Romans 8 dealing with glorification and our deliverance from vanity, corruption, bondage, and decay into the freedom of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We are now on our way toward this perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are in the process of being perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>As our Forerunner, Christ has already entered into that complete perfection, and we also will be brought there.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We will be saved to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>To be saved to the uttermost is to be brought into Christ s complete perfection where there is no vanity, corruption, bondage, groaning, decay, or sighing.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To save us in this way is the ministry of the divine priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Christ s kingly priesthood is for ministry, and His divine priesthood is for saving.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He is able to save to the uttermost because He not only is living but also is the indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Nothing can destroy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Although we may have the heart to save others, we can easily be destroyed and terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But Christ can save us to the uttermost because His priesthood is composed of an indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Regardless of our situation or the condition in which we may find ourselves, we have the divine priesthood to take care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This divine priesthood is the saving power of the indestructible life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The work of the divine High Priest is mainly to save us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The divine priesthood is constituted with the indestructible life; thus, it is able to save us to the uttermost from all the by-products of death into Christ s perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He saves to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him Heb 7:25a .</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Christ died for all mankind, but not everyone will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is because not everyone comes forward to God through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Although we may have been saved in the sense of being regenerated, we still need more saving Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we do not come forward, we cannot receive His saving.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It may be raining, but a vessel cannot receive this rain unless its opening is toward the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Likewise, many genuine Christians today do not receive Christ s saving, because they do not come forward to God.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Christ s saving in His priesthood will not reach the ones who will not come forward.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Sometimes we may be saved from our temper only to a certain extent and not to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>A sister may be about to lose her temper; hence, she turns to Christ and is stopped from losing her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>She may be saved from her temper but not to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If she were saved from her temper to the uttermost, she would be rejoicing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>For the Lord s sake, we may forgive others mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>But to be saved from remembering others mistakes is to be saved to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We may forgive others and yet still remember their mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>When God forgives us, He forgets Heb 8:12 ; hence, to forgive is to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If our forgiving does not equal forgetting, we are not saved to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If we have truly forgiven someone, we should also forget the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We need to be saved to the uttermost in our forgiving of others and from all our daily troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>When we come forward to God through Christ, our High Priest, He saves us in the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10 and by the law of the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
