<h2 class="head2">Two Brothers with Particular Gifts</h2><p>Of the seven who were selected as deacons, two&mdash;Stephen and Philip&mdash;had particular gifts. From Stephen&rsquo;s speaking in chapter seven we can realize that he was a great teacher. His long speech indicates that he was knowledgeable in God&rsquo;s Word. He surely was qualified to teach the Scriptures. Stephen&rsquo;s teaching was rich, powerful, and full of significance. He certainly was an excellent teacher. Philip also had a particular gift, and he was eventually manifested to be a great evangelist.</p><p>Although Stephen and Philip had particular gifts, when they were selected to serve tables, they willingly served. Here we have a good example. Some who have particular gifts may not be willing to serve tables. For example, suppose a certain brother is an excellent teacher. If he is selected to serve as a deacon, he may be unhappy and say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realize that I am a teacher of the Word? Why do you ask me to serve as a deacon?&rdquo; Another brother, one who is gifted in preaching the gospel, likewise may say, &ldquo;You need to realize that I am an evangelist, that I have the gift to preach the gospel. You belittle me when you ask me to serve tables.&rdquo; But from the example of Stephen and Philip we see that no matter what kind of particular gift we may have, if we are selected to serve tables, we should be willing to serve. When we are asked to serve, even if it is to clean the restroom, we should serve willingly.</p><p>According to the pattern in Acts 6, Stephen and Philip did not murmur when they were asked to serve tables. Stephen did not say, &ldquo;I am a great teacher. How can you ask me to be a deacon?&rdquo; Likewise, Philip did not say, &ldquo;I am an outstanding evangelist. Why do you ask me to serve tables?&rdquo; Instead of murmuring, Stephen and Philip did a good job in serving tables.</p><p>In the church life we are under the Lord&rsquo;s grace and also under His sovereignty. Therefore, without murmuring we should accept the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty and the environment arranged by Him. If we do this and follow the pattern in Acts 6, we shall have a happy and pleasant church life.</p><p>Stephen served tables, but eventually he functioned as a great teacher of the Word. This indicates that whatever we are in the Lord cannot be hidden. Sooner or later, what we are will be manifest. Stephen was a teacher, but he was selected to serve tables. However, the record in Acts actually says little about his serving of tables but much about his teaching. In chapter seven we have a lengthy record of Stephen&rsquo;s teaching. From the example of Stephen we see that what we can do will not be lost, and what we are will eventually be manifest. Sooner or later the Holy Spirit will use our gift, even as the Spirit used Stephen&rsquo;s gift of teaching.</p><h2 class="head2">No Leader Appointed</h2><p>In the appointment of the seven serving ones, one point is quite striking and remarkable. That is, among the seven serving ones, no leader was appointed. This indicates that no rank nor position was regarded. All the serving ones are the servants to the saints. This is a good pattern for us to learn and follow that we may avoid leadership in rank and position in any form.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GROWTH OF THE WORD<br />AND THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE DISCIPLES</h2><p>Acts 6:7 says, &ldquo;And the word of God grew, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem multiplied exceedingly; and a large number of the priests obeyed the faith.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;grew&rdquo; refers to growth in life. This indicates that the word of God is a matter of life that grows as a seed sown into man&rsquo;s heart (Mark. 4:14).</p><p>Verse 7 says that many priests obeyed the faith. &ldquo;Faith&rdquo; here is the objective faith, referring to what the believers believe in concerning Christ. The entire revelation of the New Testament concerning Christ and His redemptive work is considered the faith of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (Rom. 16:26). Therefore, the faith here, as the content of the complete gospel of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, is objective. This objective faith is mentioned in 1 Timothy 1:19; 2:7; 3:9; 4:1, 6; 5:8; 6:10, 12, 21; 2 Timothy 2:18; 3:8; 4:7; and Titus 1:13.</p>
