   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we lose this spirit, whether we are elders, co-workers, or serving ones, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the main reason why we are so barren, bearing no fruit for so many years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Recently a brother went to care for a couple, but he did not have this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He visited them no more than ten times and became disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since the couple had no heart for this brother, he reported that it was useless to visit them further.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Pastor Yu visited me, I did not care for him, but he continued to come for three or four months, week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to have this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all have to change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we need discipling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have too much of the natural thought.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to be discipled to have the divine concept, the concept of the Father s heart and the heart of the Lord Jesus, who came to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not say that your vital group is only for those in corporate living, and do not label people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We like to rank people, saying that the co-workers are the first rank, while others are the subsequent ranks.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no rank.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all are the people in the world and in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even today I am very wary that I may do something by my flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I am not wary, I will still live by my old life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I talk to my wife, I have to be careful; otherwise, I will talk to her in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then I will have to confess, Lord, even in the matter of the way I talked to my wife I was not conformed to Your death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I did not do it in Your resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Dear saints, are these things merely teachings to us?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the final item of the way to overcome the degradation of the church, 2 Timothy 4:22 says, The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Grace be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This refers to the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit to be the abiding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is abiding, remaining, in our spirit all the time as grace for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, I have checked with myself, saying, Do you live such a life?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every day, every moment, do you enjoy the Lord Jesus as the Spirit in your spirit to be the abiding grace?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have to admit that I do not.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord knows that every morning I pray, Lord, thank You for another day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am still here on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I want to live You, and I want to live with You, walk with You, work with You, and move with You.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I pray this every morning, but throughout the day, do I live with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do I talk to people with the Lord; do I work with the Lord; do I move with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a meeting I may speak with the Lord, but after I return home, I may be another person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I may be rebuked when I consider whether I am living and moving with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This illustrates that we are all far off.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we should not label people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not say that we are the class of people who live with the Lord, walk with the Lord, and work with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is not such a class.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some may claim that they are the class of saints who are able to live in corporate living, but in actuality and practicality they are not.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why then do we label people?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This kind of labeling offends people, and it indicates that we do not have a spirit for the weaker ones, for the ones who are inferior to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It also indicates that we do not want them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>People have often told me that I am an apostle, but I have never claimed that I am an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not even consider myself qualified to be a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am just the same as the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once we condemn anyone, we lose the position to take care of that one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Condemnation does not stir up our care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who among the human race is lovable?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the eyes of God, everyone is not lovable in themselves, yet God still loves them; that is, He loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not prefer to have this kind of fellowship with you, but I must speak in this way for your sake in order to shepherd you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After reading all these portions of the Word, we can see that we are in a different realm.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We say that we are in the divine and mystical realm, but in actuality we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are in the natural realm; we are still so natural.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whether or not we claim that we have a proper corporate living, we may still be in the flesh, in the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have not been crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have not been conformed to Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To know these points in the Bible is one thing, but to live them is another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To say that we live Christ by magnifying Him by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is one thing, but do we have the reality and practicality of such a life?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all have to admit that we are on the same level, with only a little difference in degree.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Regardless of how much higher one seems than another, we are still at the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all need to see this; then our mouth will be shut.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not talk about others; we are the same as they.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we are bothered by other people s criticizing, our spirit may tell us that we also criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then our mouth will be shut.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are the same as others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One may criticize ten percent, while another criticizes fifteen percent.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are the same; we are all criticizers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Someone may say that a certain brother should not be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If not, then who should be an elder?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>None are qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Pride is the biggest enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble James 4:6; 1 Pet 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whenever we criticize others, we miss grace and instead suffer God s resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We all must learn to shepherd one another.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This does not mean that since I am shepherding you, I do not need your shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I need your shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all have defects and shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Everyone has defects.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, we have to humble ourselves to meet God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This strengthens our spirit to visit people and to take care of people regardless of whether they are good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Regardless of what they are, we must go to visit them and keep visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>According to their statistics, the Jehovah s Witnesses knock on six thousand doors to visit people in order to gain one.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They do this legally, but we do not.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have no such law forcing others to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, I am trying my best to help the church to build up the vital groups with such a shepherding spirit full of love and care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We need to have this kind of love and go to tell all the dormant ones who think that the church condemns them that the church does not condemn anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Rather, the church wants to see all the dormant ones come back.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If they all would come back, I would weep with tears of thanksgiving to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Lord can testify for me that I do not condemn anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We have no qualification to condemn anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Without the Lord s mercy, we would be the same as the dormant ones.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Therefore, we must love them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It all depends upon love, as the wise king Solomon said, Love covers all transgressions Prov 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We love people.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We love the opposers, and we love the top rebels.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I really mean it.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We love them and do not hate them.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Who am I?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I am not qualified to condemn or to hate.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Am I perfect?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Even the prophet Isaiah, when he saw the Lord, said, Woe is me, for I am finished / For I am a man of unclean lips, / And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell Isa 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Who is clean today?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we criticize people and say something bad about them, we are not clean.</S>
