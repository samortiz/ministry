<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE NAMES OF SOLOMON</H2><P>Solomon had two names. The first, given by David, was Solomon, meaning "peaceable," "peaceful" (12:24a), indicating that David expected to have peace. Actually, he had no peace. In human history it is difficult to find a case like David's son Absalom's rebellion against his father. This was God's chastising hand over David. On the one hand, God forgave David, but on the other hand, He disciplined and chastised David according to His governmental righteousness.</P><P>Solomon's second name, Jedediah, given by God, means "beloved of Jehovah" (v. 25). On the one hand, God is righteous in His governmental dealing. On the other hand, God is loving and merciful, full of kindness, grace, and forgiveness. Solomon's second name indicates that he was loved by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. ENTHRONED</H2><P>First Kings 1:32-48 tells us how Solomon was enthroned.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Ordained Legitimately<br>by His Father King David</H2><P>Solomon's enthronement was ordained legitimately by his father, King David (vv. 32-37). Concerning Solomon David declared, "He shall come and sit upon my throne, and he shall reign in my place; for I have appointed him as leader over Israel and over Judah" (v. 35).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Carried Out Officially<br>by Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah</H2><P>The enthronement of Solomon was carried out officially by Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the captain of the army (vv. 38-39).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Accepted Publicly by the People</H2><P>Solomon's sitting upon the throne of the kingdom was accepted publicly by the people (vv. 40-47a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Blessed with Worship to God<br>by His Father David</H2><P>Finally, the enthronement of Solomon was blessed with worship to God by his father David, the ordainer, who said, "Blessed by Jehovah, the God of Israel, who has given me today one to sit on my throne while my eyes may see it" (v. 48).</P>
