   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STRETCHING FORTH TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 13 and 14 Paul said, "One thing I do, forgetting those things behind, and stretching forth unto those things before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the above calling of God in Christ Jesus" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. Paul was stretching forth to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to understand Paul's meaning here, we need to realize that every age has a trend, a current, a tide.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The trend of the age is always versus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are many things in the current of the age that can carry us away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ leads us upward to the heavens, but the current of the age leads us downward.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything during Paul's time, including Judaism, Greek philosophy, Gnosticism, and Roman politics, was versus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not easy to move upward when there is such a strong current to pull us downward.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, like Paul, we need to be desperate to move against the current of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul was desperate to stretch forth upward to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Lord's recovery we also need to fight against the downward trend.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Satan is subtle, and he can use anything as a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He can even use pray-reading, praising, or the release of the spirit to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan's intention is simply to keep us away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If he can accomplish this, he is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as we do not obtain Christ, Satan is happy with our shouting, calling, and pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, in all our activities we need to check whether or not we are obtaining Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do we obtain Christ in our release of the spirit, in our pray-reading, or in our meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The test, the standard, is the gaining of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not calling, shouting, or releasing the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to be assured that in whatever we do we are gaining more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The growth of life is simply the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is the daily addition of Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not think that I am now opposed to shouting, calling on the name of the Lord, or pray-reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I took the lead to practice these things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I even encouraged others to make a joyful noise in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But I wish to point out that merely calling, shouting, pray-reading, or releasing the spirit without Christ is an offense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Again and again we have pointed out that to be religious is to do something to please God without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you shout, release the spirit, or pray-read without Christ, that is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It may be a new religion, a religion invented by us, but it is nonetheless a religion, for we are trying to please God without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To do these things is to be carried downward away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To receive Christ is to move upward, but to miss Christ is to be carried downward.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you desire to shout, you must check how much of Christ there is in your shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you do not have the assurance that Christ is in your shouting, you should be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The same is true with the release of the spirit and with the calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Anything we do to worship God without Christ is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Like Paul, we need to be desperate to obtain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By the time Paul wrote the Epistle to the Philippians, he was matured.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, he was still hungry to obtain Christ and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He had no assurance that he had already attained.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, he said that he was forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things before.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He wanted to set aside everything of the past, whether it was good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Both his Jewish experiences and his Christian experiences had to be left behind that he might obtain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul seemed to be saying, "Not only my attainments in Judaism can frustrate me from seeking Christ, but even my experiences in the churches can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Anything old can keep me from experiencing Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, I am forgetting the things behind and stretching forth to the things before.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every aspect of the things before is just Christ Himself."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Philippians 3:14 Paul said, "I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the above calling of God in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Greek word for "pursue" is of the same root as the word for "persecute."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Anyone who persecutes others is desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul was desperate to follow after Christ and to seek Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all need such a desperation.</S>
