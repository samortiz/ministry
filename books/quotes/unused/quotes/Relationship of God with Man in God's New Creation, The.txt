These four things taken together form the subject of the chapters in this book that is the relationship of God with man in Gods new creation
In considering this subject, first we need to see what God is, or, to express this in another way, what kind of God Christians serve
Whether in ancient times or modern times, among civilized people or barbarians, the human race has always had some form of religion
Indeed, history shows us that there have been many different gods that have been served and worshipped by the human race
There are the Muslims, who also worship the true God, the Creator of the universe, the same God that the Jews worship
If we see this difference, it will help us to understand in a full way the relationship of God with man in His new creation
Matthew 2819 says Go therefore and disciple all the nations baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
When love is expressed, it is grace , and this grace, with the love that is its source, reaches us through the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
There is love within as the source, grace without as the expression, and the fellowship, as the transportation, the transmission
We need to realize that the Holy Spirit is the Lord Christ because 2 Corinthians 317 says clearly that the Lord that is Christ is the Spirit
Because of these two verses, 2 Corinthians 3:17 and 1 Corinthians 15:45, we know definitely that Christ the Lord is the Holy Spirit
In the foregoing verses we have seen that the Son is the Father and that the Son, who is the Lord Christ, is the Spirit
We need to recognize that although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three in person, They are one in essence
Although They are three in Their 'offices,' They are one in Their existence, for there is only one God, not three Gods
The Jews the Hebrews do not worship a God who is mingled with man because they consider that Jesus Christ was merely a man and was not God
We need to confess that God today, the God in whom we believe and whom we serve and worship, is a God who is mingled with man
We, in contrast, serve the same only true God, the Creator of the universe, yet our God also has the human nature mingled with Him
We should not think that the Holy Spirit today is only the Spirit of God with no involvement with the human nature
In the Old Testament, when the Holy Spirit came down upon a person, He was merely the Spirit of God with the divine nature
Now, in the New Testament time the Spirit enters into us and descends upon us not only with the divine nature but also with the human nature
Through the preaching of the gospel an unbeliever may be very much moved by the Holy Spirit and decide to receive the Lord Jesus
He is not only God, nor merely the Triune God, but the Triune God who includes man, the Triune God-man, the Triune God mingled with man
These verses mention the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ interchangeably, indicating that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ
Christ is mentioned interchangeably with the Spirit of Christ, indicating that the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself
In verses 9 through 11 there are actually four different titles: the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ, and the Spirit
It is wrong to think that the time when God mingled with man was when we received Him as our Savior and that before then He was only God
They have received Christ, who is God mingled with man, but they think that it is only God whom they have received
On the one hand, He is the mighty God; on the other hand, He was a human child who was born to us but was called Mighty God
The answer is found in Colossians 1:15 and 2 Corinthians 4:4, which clearly tell us that Christ is the image of God
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
Because man was created in the image of God and the image of God is Christ, man was created according to Christ
If we study Genesis 1:26-27 carefully, we will see that verse 26 speaks of 'Our image' and verse 27 of 'His own image'
We are worthless vessels of clay, but today we have a priceless treasure within us, that is, God Himself in Christ
God created man according to the image of Christ because man was intended to be a container for Christ, who is the peerless One
It is easy to know the body, because it is something physical and material, but it is more difficult to know the soul
It is even more difficult to know the spirit, because the spirit is the innermost, the deepest, part of our being
After its contents are gone, a Coca-Cola bottle is an empty bottle; likewise, a body without the person is an empty body
Strictly speaking, the body is not the person but the vessel, the container, and the dwelling place of the person
Whereas the body is the vessel, the container, and the soul is the person, the spirit is a receiver, an organ for us to receive God
Without our body we have no house in which to dwell, and without our spirit we have no receiving organ for us to receive God
On the outside there is a box as the container, and on the inside there is a small receiver to receive the radio waves
Without this receiver although there may be a box outwardly and although there may be radio waves in the air the radio cannot play any music
We would emphasize the fact that our body is not the receiver but the container to contain our soul as our person
We must be right with our spirit, which means that we must 'tune' the receiver rightly, so that the 'radio waves' will come in
We do this not by our body, nor by our mind, our emotions, or our will, but by our inmost part, which is our spirit
Without knowing the difference between the spirit and the soul, we will never be able to experience Christ as life in a practical way
Although we may talk about Christ as life, we may not know how to experience Christ in a practical and real way
John 1:12 says, 'But as many as received Him,' and Colossians 2:6 says, 'As therefore you have received the Christ'
For this reason, after creating man, God put him in front of the tree of life, which signifies God Himself as life to man
Such a wonderful One, God mingled with man, with the human nature as well as the divine nature, is the Savior waiting for you to receive Him
You are just a vessel with a body as the container, a soul as your self, and a spirit as the receiving organ to receive this wonderful One
Regardless of how wonderful He is and how poor we are, we were made as the only right and proper vessels to receive Him and contain Him
In the previous chapter we saw that our human spirit within us is the recipient or receiving organ for us to receive God in Christ
We can substantiate the sound of voices by exercising our ears, and we can substantiate odors by exercising our nose
We certainly cannot substantiate God by thinking, that is, by using our mind, for the more we think, the more it seems that God is absent
God created a spirit within us for the very purpose that we may contact Him, receive Him, and substantiate Him
The spirit within us, that is, our human spirit, not the Holy Spirit, is the place in us where God the Spirit dwells
The Holy Spirit of God is one with our spirit, for 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, 'He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit'
Based on John 4:24, Romans 8:16, and 1 Corinthians 6:17 we see clearly that our spirit is the proper organ for us to receive and contain God
The Lord is the Spirit, we have a spirit, and these two spirits mingle together, with the result that we are one with the Lord
The Holy Spirit is dwelling in our spirit; thus, our spirit is the residence and dwelling place of the Holy Spirit
We pointed out that the God whom Christians worship is the Triune God, a God of three persons, who is mingled with man
In this God there are the Father as the source, the Son as the expression, and the Holy Spirit as the transmission
The Son was incarnated to be a man, who is Christ Jesus the Lord , and even today He is the Son of Man in the heavens
How wonderful it is that the God whom we Christians serve and worship today is the Triune God mingled with man
Now that we have seen what God is and what man is, the third thing we need to see is what God's new creation is
It is correct to say that the church is the new creation, or even that the Body of Christ, the expression of Christ, is the new creation
When the Triune God with the human nature mingles Himself with a group of human beings, the issue is the new creation
The new creation is composed of many created men who have received this Triune God-man into them and are being mingled with Him as one
God, who is the Son, who is called the Father, who is the Spirit, and who is mingled with man, is now dwelling in our human spirit
The elderly Nicodemus thought that to be born anew meant to go back into his mother's womb and to be born from there again
The Lord told him in verse 5, 'Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God'
In order to understand the meaning of being born of water and the Spirit, we need to consider the background of the Lord's word
The Holy Spirit has come into us to impart Christ as life so that we can have a new beginning, a new source, a new origin, and a new course
The Holy Spirit has come in to impart something new for us to have a new beginning, source, course, and origin
If not you are merely an empty vessel but if so this is wonderful and glorious for it proves that there is a treasure Christ within you
He is the house, the dwelling place, for Psalm 90:1 says, 'O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations'
The new creation is nothing less than the Triune God-man entering into our spirit and joining Himself with us and mingling Himself with us
Now we have been born anew of the Holy Spirit to be spirit, so that we may have a new start, a new course to run, and a new life to live
There are the many nominal Christians who take Christianity merely as a religion, not knowing what Christianity is or what it teaches
We know that in order to breathe in air, there is no need to go to a supermarket or to go to our kitchen to cook
As what kind of Christian do you classify yourself a Christian of Christianity a Christian of Christian teachings or a Christian of Christ
The more we speak Christ forth the more Christ flows in because we have the living Christ within us as the living fountain source and course
Galatians 6:15 says, 'For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters'
Of these two peoples Christ created a new man in Himself, by Himself, and with Himself, and this new man is the Body
We are the parts, the members, of the one new man, the one Body, which is a universal man including all genuine Christians
In speaking concerning the relationship of God with man in His new creation, we are referring to the new man, the Body of Christ
We need to be very clear in our vision that the God whom we worship and serve is the Triune God who was incarnated as a man
Through His incarnation He brought God into man, and by His death, resurrection, and ascension He brought man into God
When He was on earth, God walked in a man on the earth, and now that He is in the heavens, man lives in God in the heavens
In their concept, forty days after His resurrection the Lord ascended into the heavens, and He is there no longer as a man
May the Lord open our eyes to see that the purpose of God's salvation is something absolutely different from our human concept
Now He presents Himself to us in the way of mingling, as God who is already mingled with man, for us to receive
If we open our spirit, which He created for us, and receive Him into us, He will be one with us and we will be one with Him
Even in the matter of whether or not to visit a certain brother or sister, we need to be assured that we are living in Christ and by Christ
Ephesians 1:5 says, 'Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
In relation to this John 118 says No one has ever seen God the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father He has declared Him
One day all the regenerated believers as the many sons of God, the expression of God, will be brought into glory, the manifestation of God
What Christianity teaches today, and what many fundamental Christians believe, is that God is bringing many sinners into heavenly mansions
The purpose of God's mingling Himself with us is that we might have the sonship, that we might become God's expression
The purpose of God's mingling with us is to make us the real, genuine, full, perfect, and complete expression of Himself
Although as human beings we were created in the image of Christ , we do not yet have the form of Christ or look like Christ
According to John 3:3-7, the first step is that Christ regenerates us in our spirit at the time we receive Him as our Savior
By the Spirit and with the freedom, the Lord continually works to transform us, that is, to transform our soul
The more we are transformed, changed, and renewed in our mind, will, and emotion, the more we grow in the divine life
The growth of a Christian is a transformation, a change in life, a change in the soul, that is, in the mind, will, and emotion
The Lord Jesus will exercise His power and authority to transfigure the body of our humiliation into a glorious body
The beautiful part of the love is in Christ, but there is still a 'tail' of the 'ugly worm' accompanying it, a little part that is of Adam
We have pointed out that we have been regenerated in our spirit and are now under the process of transformation in our soul
We will be absolutely, thoroughly, and completely in Christ and will be full of Christ and mingled with Christ from center to circumference
He is now a God-man and is living within us to mingle Himself with us in order to make us a part of His new creation
For us to be mingled with a chicken does not require both the chicken and us to be chopped up and then mixed together
In order for us to be mingled with something, we need to take that thing as our life so that it becomes our content
Many Christians today speak in different ways about Christ and God, but they neglect the fact that God in Christ is life to us
To speak concerning our physical body is easy, but it is difficult to speak about our physical life because life is abstract and mysterious
Because it is difficult to define and explain the matter of Christ and God being life to us, this matter has been lost in Christianity
It is significant that after creating man, God did not tell man to worship and serve Him or to do good things to please Him
God told man to take care of his eating, implying that God wanted man to eat the tree of life, which signifies God as life to created man
Even though some may argue that there are passages in the Scriptures that tell us to serve God, this is not what is in God's mind or heart
The Lord indicated that, instead of coming as a great prophet or a great king, He came to be small pieces of bread to be eaten by them
The one who contributed the five loaves and two fish was not a great man but a little boy , indicating something small yet rich
After man was created, he was put in front of a tree of life, which is the symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit being life to us
When Christ came, He told us that He came that we may have life and have it abundantly and that He is the life
Some Chinese people were gamblers, and others were drunkards or thieves, but one day their lives were changed by the teachings of Buddhism
We may have the terminology that Christ is our life without knowing the reality or the way to experience Him as life
In reality, if our experience of Christ as life is genuine, we do not experience a great Christ but a small Christ
Although there may be just a little light within us, that light is the life of Christ; it is Christ as life to us
As an illustration, let us consider the case of a young brother who is very proud before the older brothers and sisters
The little light sparkling, shining, and enlightening within the young brother is nothing other than Christ as life
The light of life is the Lord Jesus Himself as light within us shining all the time, not in a bold way but in a gentle way, little by little
We need to learn to experience Christ in this normal and quiet way, by taking care of the inner shining within us
If we wish to take something into us and be mingled with it, we must take that thing as our intrinsic constituent
The Triune God-God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit-comes into us to be life to us when we believe in Christ
The law of the Spirit of life is simply the law of life and the law of life is the law of Christ which is nothing less than Christ Himself
The life is the Lord Jesus, the light is the Lord Jesus, the law is the Lord Jesus, and love is the Lord Jesus
The law here is a new law, different from the law of the old covenant, the law of Moses, which was written in letters on tablets of stone
Another part of the spirit is the fellowship, which affords us the capacity to contact God and have fellowship with Him
In addition, in the spirit there is the intuition, giving us a direct sense of God and a direct knowledge from God
In Jeremiah 31:33 God says that He will put His law in our inward parts, that is, in our soul, in our mind, emotion, and will
The law of life is put not merely into one part of our being but into all our inward parts and then inscribed upon us
The first step God takes is to put the law of life into us, and the second step is to inscribe it upon our heart
In the New Testament time God Himself, the God of holiness, righteousness, love, and light, has come into us as a living law
Because God is a law with many attributes, this law can become several laws as it spreads into our different inward parts
If we were to chase all of these animals toward a pool of water, the ducks would jump into the water, but the chickens would all scatter
The stronger the life is, the stronger the law of that life will be, and the richer the life is, the richer its law will be
Just by allowing the apple tree to grow for a certain length of time, the law of the apple life will cause many apples to come forth
Many seeds look alike, but when they are sown into the soil and allowed to grow, flowers of different colors and shapes come forth
The law of the divine life not only restricts us from doing evil things but also regulates us to bring forth good things
If we have something within shining and illuminating us all the time, we can be sure that we have Christ as our life
The more we are regulated by the inner law of life, the more we will be transformed in our mind, emotion, and will
We must realize that Christ today is within us as life, and this life is the light shining in us and the law regulating us
Although we may have experienced the inner shining and regulating many times already, we must learn to experience them more and more
By comparing the one prophecy in Jeremiah 31:33 and the two quotations in Hebrews 8:10 and 10:16, we can see at least three changes
Both the prophecy and the two quotations indicate that first the law must be put into us, and then it must be written on us
Since this law is something put into our inward parts and written on our hearts, this law must be something of life and in the Spirit
The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus is not simple, for it involves five items: the law, the Spirit, life, Christ, and Jesus
In order to understand them and then to minister them, we must spend much time to look into the relevant passages in the Scriptures
In Christ Jesus,' his emphasis is on what Christ Jesus is, that is, on His person, rather than on what He does
The Spirit is the substance, the essence, of God, and the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the persons of this one God
One day the Son was incarnated to be a man, and He lived and walked on this earth for thirty-three and a half years
Eventually, He was crucified on the cross, and after three days He was raised from the dead both spiritually and physically
He showed His disciples His hands and feet, indicating that after His resurrection He still bears a physical body with flesh and bones
Before the incarnation He was merely the Triune God in His divinity, but after the incarnation He is the Triune God mingled with man
The teachings of the modernists, who say that Christ never resurrected, are devilish, and we must have nothing to do with them
The Bible tells us clearly that Christ died, and three days later He resurrected from the dead, both spiritually and physically
The human nature in the Holy Spirit was redeemed, sanctified, and uplifted through the death and resurrection of Christ
We are men who are contained in a body as a vessel, with a receiving organ, a spirit, as the center of our being
Although we are living by the breakfast within us, we do not feel it, for there is nothing special or particular about it
Many Christians today are looking for something special and peculiar, not realizing that they have the Lord as the quiet One within them
We must be clear that since we have received Christ as our Savior, He, the wonderful One, is now within us in a very quiet and normal way
The most normal Christian life is one in which Christ is experienced by us as life in a quiet and ordinary way
The best experience for a Christian is to have some light within, but not to be absolutely sure that it is of the Lord
We need to know the right way to experience Him, that is, the normal, quiet, and ordinary way, which is the inner way of life
In this covenant there is no need for others to teach us to know the Lord, because we will all know Him, even the least among us
The Lord is so willing to be our God and to have a relationship with us that He has made a covenant that is a contract an agreement with us
Once a contract is made or an agreement is signed, there is no margin for any change and no possibility of any choice
In the divine contract made and signed by God, there is only one term, one condition: God has said that He will put His own law into us
In contrast, a business contract may contain term after term, condition after condition, each with many sub-terms and sub-conditions
Before the incarnation, in the Triune God there were only the three persons-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
In this man He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, passing through the experiences of the human life
If we will not be subdued by Him today He will wait until tomorrow and if we will not be subdued tomorrow He will wait for the following day
There are also the resurrection power, the element of glorification, and the ascension, enthronement, lordship, and headship
In a relationship between a husband and a wife there can be friction, even when both are Christians and love the Lord
While she is speaking to him, there is another One speaking to her, telling her that regardless of how her husband is, she must not argue
As we cooperate with the inner regulating we experience being not only transparent but also transcendent far above all and in the heavenlies
Regardless of how long we have been saved, as long as we are Christians who are born again, the all-inclusive Christ dwells in us
In resurrection we experience many things of Christ, including His glorification, ascension, headship, and lordship
By this law we are able to know God, to know what He likes and dislikes and what pleases Him and does not please Him
According to Hebrews 8:10-11, we have the law within us, and according to 1 John 2:27, we have the anointing within us
We have seen that the law within us is the law of life, the living law, the Triune God Himself with all His fullness living within us
If the Spirit as the ointment only remained in us but was not working in us, He would be only the ointment, not the anointing
When the switch is turned off, although there is still electricity in the building, there is no flowing, no current, of electricity
When we have the anointing, we know that we have the ointment, not because of objective knowledge but because we feel it and sense it
We not only know that the Holy Spirit is in us, but we also feel and sense that He is working in us all the time
The all-inclusive Christ, who is now within us, is life to us, and this life is the light shining and the law regulating
The Spirit within us is shining, regulating, and anointing all the time, for He is the light, the law, and the ointment
In addition to the shining and the regulating, we have a deep feeling that something is gently and pleasantly moving within us
The shining brings the light to us, making us clear and bright in everything, causing us not to be in darkness
In the Old Testament a person was right with God if he did not break the law, the Ten Commandments, in anything
Today whenever we go along with the inner regulating, we have a conscience full of peace and rest because there is no accusation in it
There is also a difference between the shining and the regulating, on the one hand, and the anointing, on the other hand
Once we are in the barber shop, the style in which our hair is cut is not a matter of guidance but a matter of the inner law
Which day the sisters go to a department store to do their shopping and which store they go to are matters of guidance through the anointing
When they are in the store buying clothing, which designs and colors they choose are a matter of the regulating of the law of life
Within us there is the inner law, the law of life, regulating us all the time, and there is also the anointing guiding us continually
At that time everyone was afraid of the Japanese military police, because once a person was in their hands, his life could end very quickly
The inner life is Christ Himself experienced by us as our life, and the church life is the expression of Christ in a corporate way
There is no need for others to teach us and tell us to know God, because we know Him through the spontaneous capacity of the law of life
The more you receive these teachings, the more the inner teaching within you, the inner anointing and the law of life, will be developed
Conversely, if we have the inner anointing and forget the Scriptures, we may be very living but also very misguided
We need to be balanced, having both the anointing within to make us living and the Scriptures without to balance and check us
With everything God has created, there are two sides; for example, we have two hands, two ears, two eyes, and two feet
Consequently, the fundamentalists are dead, and the Pentecostals are mistaken in their emphasizing of Pentecostal things
During the day there was the pillar of cloud, and in the night, because there was no light, there was the pillar of fire
The pillar of cloud was a type of the Holy Spirit, and the pillar of fire was a type of the Scriptures, the Word of God
When we speak the word, it becomes the word again, and when this word enters into someone else, it becomes the Spirit again
In a previous chapter we saw that Christ, the Son of God, is called the Father , and that He as the Lord is the Spirit
When we receive Him, He comes into us not only as our Savior, our Lord, and our God, but even more as our life
Whether as the light shining or the law regulating, the divine life works and moves within us in a very quiet, normal, and ordinary way
Our human thought is that God is wonderful and great and that we need His help in a supernatural and miraculous way
You will see that today the wonderful God works within you in a quiet, normal, and ordinary way and that you need to go along with Him
All the material things, including the food we eat, are types and figures of Christ and can help us to know Christ
Luke 24:13-35 gives us an account of two disciples who, after the Lord resurrected, left Jerusalem to go to Emmaus
Rather, He talked with them, walked with them, and stayed with them without telling them that it was He whom they were speaking about
The Lord Jesus dwells within us as life today in just such a hidden, normal way, without anything extraordinary or special
We Christians always expect to experience something extraordinary, because we are not clear concerning the Lord's way of life
The Jesus Christ who dwells in us today is the same One who walked with the two disciples on the way to Emmaus
Day by day and moment by moment we must learn to know and experience this wonderful, profound, and marvelous Savior
John 7:38-39 says, 'He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water
According to John 7:39, before Jesus was glorified, such a Holy Spirit who has both the divine nature and the human nature was not yet
Verse 6 speaks of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, and in verse 7 the same Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of Jesus
On the one hand, this Spirit is the Spirit of God, and on the other hand, He is the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of a man
When Christ comes into us as life, He is the eternal life with both the divine life and nature and the human life and nature
We may wonder why the eternal life that we have received is a life of the divine nature and the human nature as well
The wonderful Savior works, moves, lives, and acts as life within us in a quiet, normal, ordinary way and also in a very human way
Although this was a leading from the Lord, there was nothing extraordinary about it; instead, it was very ordinary, normal, and human
The way Christ works in us as life is very ordinary for He as the indwelling Spirit has not only the divine nature but also the human nature
The Holy Spirit who dwells within us is a Spirit not only of the life and nature of God but also of the life and nature of a proper man
In contrast, many Christians consider that if we take Christ as life and live by Him, we need to be like angels, not like human beings
There was once a servant of the Lord who was invited to minister in a certain city where the people considered him to be very spiritual
One morning when you rise up, read the Scriptures, and pray, you may have just a little feeling or sense within to give up certain things
Do not doubt but believe, for this is the way the Lord works within us today, not in a miraculous way but in a very human way
She was from a rich family and wanted a share in the familys inheritance but in China the inheritance passes only to sons not to daughters
She purposely went to school to study law in order to file a lawsuit against her brothers over the inheritance
During one winter vacation her mother, who was a genuine believer and had been recently revived by the Lord, brought her to a church meeting
When we asked her mother about this, she told us that she had not dared to touch this matter with her daughter
Many times she had thought that this might be herself and not the Lord, but the more she doubted, the more constant the sense was
Even though some may occasionally have such experiences, the ordinary way to experience Christ is in a normal, quiet, and human way
The law mentioned here is not the law in letters written on outward tablets of stone, but the law of life in spirit written in our hearts
In order to take some bread as the life supply to our body, we cannot simply admire it and keep it in our pocket
In John 6:51 the Lord Jesus said, 'I am the living bread,' and in verse 57 He said, 'He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me'
We need to eat more of Him so that we can digest Him and He can mingle Himself with us to become the very constituent of our life
Day by day He is not only living within you but also mingling Himself with you and becoming a part of your being
As a seed, Jesus has within Him a wonderful life, a life that is the almighty, infinite, all-inclusive, and omnipotent God
Since the time that we received Christ as our Savior, we have experienced something within us living, shining, and regulating all the time
Conybeare, in his translation of the New Testament, tells us that the word supply here in Greek is a special word
In ancient times among the Greeks, a group of people who danced and sang to entertain people was called a chorus
When the Holy Spirit came down for the incarnation of God in humanity , He was merely the Spirit of God with no other elements
All these elements are included in the one Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is an all-inclusive dose that contains all the elements required to meet our need in full
Day by day, morning and evening, little by little, something within him was illuminating, shining, and regulating him
When the Spirit of Jesus Christ is moving in us working in us and anointing us He gives us a little sense a consciousness in our inner being
If we take care of this and go along with it, the Spirit will kill the 'germs,' the negative things, in our being
On our part, all that is needed is to go along with the Lord, who continually works in us and anoints us within
We need to simply go along with the gentle, quiet feeling in our inner being that results from the Lord's working in us
We should not expect anything magnificent or extraordinary, for that is not the proper way to experience Christ as life
Christ is such a wonderful Savior, yet when He as the Spirit operates in us, He does so in a very ordinary, normal, and human way
It is easy to doubt such a small feeling, thinking that it is just something of yourself rather than the Lord's answer and help
You should go along with this feeling and pray, opening to the Lord and seeking His mind and will concerning your prayer
You may have a little feeling to pray for a certain brother, or to pray for yourself that you may see something more of the Lord
When you are criticized, there will be a little feeling within that you should receive this kind of criticism and thank the Lord for it
Day by day and moment by moment these people will gradually be transformed into the image of Christ from glory to glory
Automatically and spontaneously they will be built up together and coordinated as a corporate Body to express Christ in a living way
