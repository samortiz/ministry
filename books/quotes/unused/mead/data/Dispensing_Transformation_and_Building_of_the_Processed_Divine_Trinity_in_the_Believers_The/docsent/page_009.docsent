   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PROCESSED DIVINE TRINITY IN THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: Rom 12:2a; Titus 3:5b; 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 4:22-24; 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 8:29; 1 John 3:2; 1 Cor 3:12; Gen 2:9, 16-17 OUTLINE The dispensing of God renews the believers; the renewing of God issues in transformation Rom 12:2a: The dispensing for renewing continues the dispensing for regeneration Titus 3:5b.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For the believers to shed their old creation and be transformed into God's new creation to put off the man of the old creation and to put on the man of the new creation 2 Cor 5:17; Eph 4:22-24.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The transformation of God carries out a work in the believers to change their essence with the rich life element of Christ 2 Cor 3:18a: From the believers' spirit to every part of their inward being Rom 12:2a.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Until the believers are conformed to the glorious image of Christ made exactly the same as the Triune God 2 Cor 3:18b; Rom 8:29; 1 John 3:2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the believers to become the precious materials gold, silver, and precious stones for the building up of the church 1 Cor 3:12.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The principle of God in the transformation of the believers is not that they would forsake evil and follow good but that they would be delivered from good and evil and follow His divine life: At the very outset, the divine revelation in the Bible presents the tree of life and the tree of good and evil, indicating these two principles Gen 2:9, 16-17.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because they are blinded in darkness, the fallen people disregard the divine life and lean on the principle of forsaking evil and following good.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Most of the teachings in Christianity today are based on the principle of forsaking evil and following good and neglect the principle of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The teachings on forsaking evil and following good can only teach and improve people; they cannot change people in their essence to make them the new creation of God's desire according to His divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE DISPENSING WORK OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The general subject of this conference is "The Dispensing, Transformation, and Building of the Processed Divine Trinity in the Believers."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Simply speaking, the subject is "The Highest Purpose of God in the Creation of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The processed Divine Trinity is not simply the Triune God, but One who has been processed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is no longer merely the God in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, He is a God who went through incarnation, who went through a sinless human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, who went through death and resurrection, and who became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, He ascended to the height of the heavens not only with divinity but also with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is man exalted and glorified in God to be made both Lord and Christ in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a processed Triune God today comes into us to be with us by our believing in Him and receiving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Triune God's being with us is to dispense Himself wholly and completely into us to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians know that God has come into them, yet they do not know what God is doing in them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They think that since God has regenerated them, He is doing nothing now but waiting in them until they go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, if we read the entire New Testament we will discover that this God who is in us is busier today than when He was on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When He was on the earth He only preached the gospel, taught the truth, opened the eyes of the blind, raised the dead, and trained the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But today this Lord enters into millions of people to transform and renew every one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is much more difficult than His work on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is rather easy for a person to change.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All he needs to do is to change his clothing, get a haircut, adjust his behavior, and alter his accent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this way he is altogether changed in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, transformation is not merely an outward change; it is a metabolic change in the inward essence and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whereas the outward change can be accomplished by human work, the inward transformation must be a matter that is absolutely organic.</S>
