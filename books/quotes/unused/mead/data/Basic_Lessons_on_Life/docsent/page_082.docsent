   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR SPIRIT BEING THE HIDDEN MAN OF THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Peter 3:4 reveals that our spirit is the hidden man of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The hidden man is a meek and quiet spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When our spirit is meek and quiet, it is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Peter 3:4 indicates that every part of our being may be considered as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our physical body is our outward man, our soul is our expressed, manifested man, and our spirit is our hidden man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to 1 Peter 3, the most beautiful part of our being, the prettiest adornment, in the sight of God is a meek and quiet spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the hidden man of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This point shows that our spirit is the deepest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So if we are going to be pretty in the eyes of God, we have to be pretty from the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not be pretty just outwardly, in a physical way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to be pretty inwardly, in the hidden man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This man is hidden from the eyes of man, but it is not hidden from the eyes of God, because such a hidden man, that is, a meek and quiet spirit, is pretty in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to point out that 1 Peter 3:4, on the one hand, says something about the hidden man but, on the other hand, refers to it as being in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that this meek and quiet spirit is hidden in our heart from human eyes, but it is not hidden in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God sees it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So this is the real beauty a godly person should have.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>OUR REGENERATED SPIRIT BEING OUR INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to help the saints realize that our human spirit is the lamp of God, serving God with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, this spirit is a beautiful, hidden man in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Also, when our spirit is regenerated, it becomes the inner man Eph 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The sense of the word inner is stronger than the sense of the word hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The hidden man is one that is not manifested, but the inner man can be very active and aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Ephesians 3, the inner man must be very active and very aggressive to live the Lord out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After the inner man is strengthened, Christ has the way to make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that the inner man is not just something hidden, meek, and quiet but is something very living, active, and aggressive so that Christ may use it for Himself to make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the Bible, I believe the above three points are the basic description of what our spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our spirit is the lamp of the Lord, a pretty, hidden man in God's eyes, and the inner man, living, active, and aggressive for the Lord to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These three points help us to know what our spirit is.</S>
