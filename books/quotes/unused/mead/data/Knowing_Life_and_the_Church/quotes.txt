[1]  The Subjective Obstacles Encountered by God s Life in Us
[2]  Recently I have had a heavy burden: Even though the number of brothers and sisters is increasing, I wonder how much the measure of the stature of Christ is increasing in the church.
[3]  Therefore, I have a strong feeling that we should help the brothers and sisters know life and the church.
[4]  If we read the first two chapters of Genesis and meditate quietly before God on His creation, we will see that God s creation involves life and produces life.
[5]  Since man failed utterly with respect to the law, God became flesh and came into man John 1:14 .
[6]  The One who came to mankind and became a man was the Lord Jesus.
[7]  Life was in the Lord Jesus v. 4 . We need to pay special attention to John chapter 1 and Genesis chapter 2; we need to read these two chapters together.
[8]  Without Genesis, we would think that it is quite strange for the first chapter of John, which outlines God s purpose, to begin by saying, In Him was life v. 4 . We surely would ask, What is life? What does the phrase in Him was life mean? Genesis helps by showing that after man was tempted and fell, he lost the top blessing of life; he lost a treasure, the center in the universe.
[9]  The characteristics, marvelousness, and intrinsic mystery of the church depend on God s life.
[10]  The church is the church because she has God s life.
[11]  If life is taken away from the church, the church would become ugly, withered, and dead.
[12]  All the beauty, power, brightness, and ability of the church come from the fact that the life of God is her inward content.
[13]  This life is the life of Christ; Christ is God becoming flesh and coming into us through the Holy Spirit to be our life.
[14]  God s life is in the Holy Spirit, and this life is the God who was in the beginning and the Creator who existed in the beginning.
[15]  As believers, we have God s life in us, but we still need to ask about the condition of this life.
[16]  CHAPTER TWO LIFE BEING GOD HIMSELF ENJOYED BY MAN Scripture Reading: Psa 36:7-9; John 1:4; 8:12; 10:10; 6:63; Rom 8:2
[17]  We have already seen that God s goal in creation and redemption is life.
[18]  Furthermore, the story of the entire universe is related to life in living creatures, with God s life being the highest life.
[19]  The source of all life in the universe is God.
[20]  Hence, the story of the universe comes from God s life.
[21]  Let us examine these four points: First, man can take refuge in God s loving-kindness; second, man enjoys God s fatness and the river of His pleasures when he takes refuge in God s lovingkindness; third, man enjoys God s fatness and the river of His pleasures in God s life; and fourth, man can touch God s life in His light.
[22]  We often hear people say that a certain brother or sister s life is truly wonderful and rich.
[23]  If I heard such a word ten years ago, I would have believed it without a doubt.
[24]  However, gradually God has opened my eyes to see that a certain brother s humbleness or a certain sister s gentleness may not be the issue of being rich in life.
[25]  However, when we contact yet another saint, we cannot tell if he is proud or humble; instead, we sense that we are touching God, and it is as if we have come before God.
[26]  Since life is God Himself, how can man touch and obtain life so that this life can come into him?
[27]  One of the disciples made a very interesting request of the Lord Jesus, saying, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us John 14:8 .
[28]  This indicates that they knew of God the Father but had never seen or touched Him.
[29]  Therefore, when God s word operates and starts to have an effect on us and if we willingly obey, we are immediately filled with light, life, the Spirit s presence, Christ, and God.
[30]  However, from our experience, we know that God s life also faces obstacles and difficulties in us.
[31]  Although we know that God s life has come into us to be our life and to be lived out of us, in reality, this life encounters obstacles in us.
[32]  We should never think that the lukewarmness and backsliding of some brothers and sisters are a hindrance to God s life but that the zealous pursuit of the Lord by other saints is not a hindrance to God s life.
[33]  The second problem that life encounters in us is hypocrisy.
[34]  There was a sister in the church in Nanking who spoke slowly and walked softly; everything she did was soft and gentle.
[35]  Consequently, all the responsible brothers in the church in Nanking thought that she was very spiritual.
[36]  Christ operates and moves in us in order to make us clear about His will and requirements for us and about His leading and dealing with us.
[37]  However, if we do not obey but go against the feeling within, not accepting His leading or paying the price, this unwillingness and opposition are rebellion.
[38]  In this case, we may have our freedom and choice, but we will not have the way of life.
[39]  Many times, we think that we are obeying the Lord, but actually we are rebelling against the Lord.
[40]  If we visit people in this way, they will certainly not be able to sense God s presence with us, because we have disobeyed the living Christ in us.
[41]  ENCOUNTERED BY GOD S LIFE IN US Scripture Reading: Rom 12:2; Phil 2:5, 13; 2 Thes 3:5 FOUR DIFFERENT KINDS OF OBSTACLES
[42]  In the previous message we saw four different obstacles that God s life encounters in us.
[43]  We need to understand that God s life does not come into us to be our life in an outward way.
[44]  Some people correctly think that before they were saved, they did not have God s life but then incorrectly assume that God s life replaced their human life after their salvation.
[45]  It is as if we are all bad actors in a two-man comic show, who cannot act in unison and who are not professional.
[46]  God s life may move in us, but we do not move according to Him; we are not one with Him.
[47]  Our spirit is the deepest part of our being, and God s life is in His Spirit.
[48]  Even though our mind often understands the intention in our spirit and we know the will of God, we are unwilling to submit and obey.
[49]  When he prays and the Lord gives him a feeling in his spirit to apologize to his wife, his mind has no difficulty in understanding this feeling, but his will is stubborn and unwilling to submit.
[50]  CHAPTER FIVE THE PATHWAY OF LIFE Scripture Reading: John 12:24; 2 Cor 4:10-11
[51]  Philippians 3:10 says, To know...the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.
[52]  According to the original Greek, these two phrases are two of the hardest phrases to translate because there is no such expression in Chinese.
[53]  Having fellowship in the Lord s sufferings is to have fellowship with the Lord in His sufferings and through His sufferings.
[54]  Although the life of God is in us, His life often cannot come out of us because there are strong hindrances, obstacles, and restrictions in us.
[55]  Second, we need God to open our eyes to see that we are a hindrance to the life of God.
[56]  We may be naturally irritable or meek, or we may be naturally quick or slow, but in any case, we are a problem to the life of God.
[57]  As long as we have a heart for God, sooner or later He will show us that we are a problem to His life.
[58]  In other words, if we want to let the life of God come out of us and if we want to walk the way of life and live the Christian life, we need to look to God to open our eyes and show us that our very person is a problem to the life of God.
[59]  CHAPTER SIX THE WAY AND LIFE OF THE CROSS Scripture Reading: Rom 8:13-14; Gal 5:16, 24 SEEING THAT WE HAVE BEEN CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST
[60]  At a certain point in our Christian life, the Holy Spirit will show us that we have been nailed to the cross, even though we restrict and hinder God as life.
[61]  In other words, the Holy Spirit will show every pursuer and follower of the Lord a vision, a revelation, that his person has been put to death on the cross of Christ.
[62]  This is a turning point that every lover and pursuer of the Lord must experience; it is unavoidable.
[63]  When we are saved or revived, we always have a certain amount of zeal, a love for the Lord, a desire to pursue Him, an eagerness to follow Him, and a fervency to express our love for Him.
[64]  However, we soon discover that our very being hinders Him the most, even though we pursue and zealously follow the Lord.
[65]  The meaning of the cross is death, and the function of the cross is to put us to death.
[66]  When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was not just suffering; He was dying.
[67]  In our spiritual experience, when the Holy Spirit enlightens us to see that we have been crucified, we rejoice, we are happy, and we praise the Lord.
[68]  From his Epistles we can see that Paul speaks of the cross in two different ways.
[69]  First, he speaks of our having been crucified with Christ; this was accomplished by Christ.
[70]  When Christ was crucified, He took us with Him so that we died in Him.
[71]  THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:26-29 THE OUTER MAN NEEDING TO BE BROKEN
[72]  The only goal of the Holy Spirit s work in us is to bring us into the experience of the death of the cross.
[73]  The Holy Spirit desires to find a place and an opening for Christ in us; He is working Christ into us so that Christ can come out from within us.
[74]  In order for Christ to come into us, we need to be broken and broadened, and in order for Christ to come out of us, our outer man needs to be torn down and many things in us need to be broken.
[75]  No matter how much light we receive, how much truth we hear, how often we read the Bible, how much we are touched by God, and how many lessons we learn, we still have places within us that we do not want to be broken by the cross.
[76]  We should not assume that because the Bible speaks of the shining and touching of the Holy Spirit and of the shining and calling of the cross that man will receive the cross and willingly accept the breaking of the cross.
[77]  God s arrangement, ordination, permission, and move in our environment are the discipline of the Holy Spirit.
[78]  The Holy Spirit rules over our environment, and He moves and arranges everything to break our person.
[79]  Our spouse is God s helper in breaking us.
[80]  Sometimes our spouse s cooperation with God is not sufficient, so He gives us children.
[81]  If our spouse, as God s chief helper, is not sufficient to deal with us, He adds more little helpers to deal with us.
[82]  For this reason, the Holy Spirit raises up a yearning prayer in us, and He intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered, causing us to desire God s grace within, to have Christ s image, and to be filled with Christ s life v. 26 . With this kind of desire and prayer of the Holy Spirit within us, these prayers and groanings pass through the Holy Spirit and reach God.
[83]  When our desire to be filled with Christ and to bear the image of God s Son is matched with the Holy Spirit s intercession, God hears our prayer and raises up an environment to deal with us.
[84]  THE BASIS FOR DISCERNING THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:15-18; Eph 1:22-23; 5:29-32
[85]  Concerning the matter of life, I believe the Spirit of God has shown us some light in the preceding chapters to see the life in us and what it wants to produce in us.
[86]  In this chapter we will look at the matter of the church.
[87]  Now we must consider how to discern the church, that is, what the church is and what it is not.
[88]  If we study the reason for the division and scattering of the church, we find one thing: things other than Christ have been brought into the church.
[89]  The church is divided and confused because of one reason only something other than Christ has been brought into the church.
[90]  The third thing that the church should not have is special fellowships.
[91]  In proper circumstances, as the children of God with the same Father, we can have fellowship with one another in the Father s life 1 John 1:3 .
[92]  The saints need to see the basic point that the church is Christ Himself, that is, Christ Himself in the saints.
[93]  We must look to the Lord for His mercy to see that the church is nothing other than Christ.
[94]  Whenever we have some activities in the church, regardless of whether it involves a decision, an arrangement, or a suggestion, we should always remember that God must be mingled with us, that we must be mingled with God, and that we must submit to God.
[95]  The church is the mingling of God with man, but a great principle in this mingling is man s subjection to God.
[96]  Being subject to her husband does not mean that a sister no longer uses her mind, emotion, and will; rather, it means that she accepts God s will, God s view, and is subject to God.
[97]  In a strong and spiritual church, the believers are full of choices, preferences, and thoughts; however, their choices are God s choices, their preferences are God s preferences, and their ideas are God s ideas.
[98]  If a group calls itself the church, its inward condition, activities, and everything about it must be according to the Bible.
[99]  According to the Bible, a local church should not have a special name, a special belief, or a special fellowship.
[100]  If people ask us what church we are from, we should tell them that we are in the church.
[101]  If we want to determine whether a group is the church, the Bible is the first filter and Christ is the second.
[102]  Furthermore, we also need the filter of the Holy Spirit.
[103]  We need to realize that Christ is the life of the church, but the Holy Spirit is the move and operation of the church, both of which involve the authority of the church.
[104]  The church is an organic entity of God mingled with man, of man completely submitting to God, living completely in God, and moving fully with God.
[105]  In addition to the previous four points, we need to pay attention to cultivating the talents of the saints.
[106]  Concerning this, we need to pay attention first to the young people, and among the young people, we should concentrate on the students.
[107]  If the work in a locality cannot gain the students who are there, then their work is a failure, and this kind of failure means that there is no future.
[108]  CHAPTER TEN THE TYPES OF THE TABERNACLE, THE ALTAR,
[109]  In our speaking about the church, we have been able to touch only a few points, because the matter of knowing the church is a broad topic.
[110]  If we want to test any Christian group with the Bible, we need to see the crucial point that Christ is the content of the church.
[111]  In a normal situation the Ark and the tabernacle should always be joined together and never separated from each other.
[112]  This means that under normal circumstances Christ and His outward form and expression should not be separated.
[113]  However, something abnormal happened in the Old Testament God s children failed and the Israelites became desolate and degraded.
[114]  If we want to examine the church in our locality, the best means are by the tabernacle, the bronze altar, and the Ark. The tabernacle refers to the outward expression of Christ, the church.
[115]  The bronze altar refers to the cross, which is the truth of redemption, and the Ark refers to Christ Himself.
[116]  The church may preach the gospel, bring people into the worship of God, and even help people receive Christ s redemption, grace, and salvation.
[117]  If there is only the element of man and nothing of the element of Christ in a church or if there is very little of the element of Christ in a church, then it does not have the Ark; it has lost the Ark. This kind of church may have the outward form of Christ, the redemption of Christ through His cross, and the name of Christ for people to be saved, but it does not have Christ as its inward reality, life, and center.
[118]  If we want to speak about the matter of the church, we must see that the tabernacle needs the Ark. Without the Ark, the tabernacle is a place that does not have God s presence.
[119]  Even if everyone pays attention to the tabernacle, we should pay attention to the Ark. The Bible is precious, and it shows that the Ark was not in anyone s hands but David s. Even though God s children were desolate, David knew God s heart.
[120]  The center of the church is the mingling of God with man man being subdued before God, being mingled with Christ, taking Christ as his life and person, taking Christ s heart as his heart, taking Christ s emotion as his emotion, and taking Christ s will as his will.
[121]  If every move and idea of a certain church come only from man, this church does not have the Ark. If the brothers serve God by placing themselves in the incarnated Christ and if they take His mind as their mind, His will as their will, His emotion as their emotion, and His life as their life, giving Him the ground to be their center and everything and submitting to the living Christ, then that church has the Ark.
[122]  Today orthodox Christians can be divided into three main groups: one group focuses on the tabernacle, another group focuses on the altar, and yet another group focuses on the Ark. However, there are not many who pay attention to the Ark.
[123]  Preaching the gospel by playing basketball can bring a Christian only to the altar; it can never bring a Christian to the experience of the Ark. We dare not say that no one can be saved through this kind of basketball gospel preaching, but one thing is certain we can rarely find anyone who is saved in this way who is willing to forsake the world, bear the cross, take the Lord s life as his life, and follow the Lord to walk in the way of the cross.
[124]  May the Holy Spirit enlighten us to see that when God s children are in desolation and when God s testimony is affected by man, we must pay attention to these three things simultaneously: the tabernacle, the altar, and the Ark. According to typology, we must focus on the matter of the church, the matter of redemption, and the matter of Christ as life at the same time.
[125]  If we consider the condition of the churches in the localities today, we are satisfactory in respect to the tabernacle and the altar, but we are very short in respect to the Ark. This means that the churches do not have any problem with the outward form of the church and the redemption of Christ, but their knowledge of Christ is poor and inadequate.
[126]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 4:12-13 THE GENUINE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH
[127]  After seeing the types of the tabernacle, the altar, and the Ark, which signify the outward form of the church, redemption, and Christ, we must see how to measure the church.
[128]  In other words, we must see how to measure the spiritual worth, weight, and position of a church.
[129]  All the gifts that Christ gave to the church are for the building up of His Body; the goal of the building up is for the Body of Christ to become full grown and to attain to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ v. 13 .
[130]  Consequently, if we want to evaluate the church, we must not do it according to anything other than Christ Himself, and we must see that a group of Christians has the inward stature of Christ.
[131]  In the church there is not only the matter of life but also the matter of authority.
[132]  Some may ask where the matter of authority in the church is spoken of in the Bible.
[133]  Romans 12:3 says, I say,...to everyone who is among you, not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith.
[134]  THE BIBLE AND THE INNER LIFE Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22-23
[135]  After we spent time before the Lord seeking His will concerning the different aspects of the church, the Lord in my spirit has given me the sense that we should touch the matter of the church according to the actual situation of the saints.
[136]  In principle we can divide this topic into two aspects: the first aspect concerns the Bible, and the second aspect concerns the inner life.
[137]  All the children of God who are godly must confess that we cannot accept anything that is not according to the Bible, that cannot stand up to the scrutiny of the Bible, or that clearly violates and is against the teachings of the Bible.
[138]  If we are not serious Christians, there is not much else to say, but if we want to be serious Christians, we must fear the Lord and respect His Word, bringing all the matters concerning the church under the light of the Bible to obtain God s rule and standard.
[139]  The most precious thing to a Christian is that we have not only the Bible outwardly, but the life of God inwardly.
[140]  Similarly, as saved ones, we have Christ s life in us, and His life demands that we receive supply and satisfaction in the church; furthermore, this demand also has a taste.
[141]  The taste of life in genuine Christians tells us where we should meet to please the Lord where there is spiritual food, where there is the Lord s presence, and where God feeds His children.
[142]  Christ is the embodiment of God, and He is God becoming flesh, taking the likeness of a man, and living the life of a man.
[143]  Anything that relies upon man s ability, organization, and way of doing things cannot reach this goal.
[144]  Whenever we touch the matter of the church, we need to stop our whole being.
[145]  When people touch the matter of the church, all of the I s, like I think, I view, I want, and I will, begin to come out.
[146]  FOR TESTING THESE REQUIREMENTS Scripture Reading: Rom 12:3-5 THE SPIRITUAL REQUIREMENTS OF A CHRISTIAN
[147]  Everyone who follows the Lord must realize that there are certain spiritual requirements in every spiritual matter.
[148]  If we have been shown mercy and love the Lord, and if we are willing to learn to live before the Lord, then spontaneously our heart will turn to the Lord and love Him.
[149]  SPIRITUAL REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE CHURCH Life Requiring Us to Have Fellowship
[150]  Every saved person who lives before the Lord definitely has some spiritual requirements within him.
[151]  Based on this principle, we need to know the requirements that are related to the church.
[152]  As soon as we begin to live before the Lord, we can sense a spiritual requirement within to fellowship with other saints.
[153]  The life we have received, which is in each one of us, is not an individual life; rather, it is the Lord s life, a great life.
[154]  Life also demands that we be served and supplied by others.
[155]  The reason we come to break bread, pray, fellowship, or even listen to a message is because the life in us has a requirement of needing to be supplied.
[156]  If we go to a meeting or listen to a message, and if the meeting is full of supply and the Lord s presence, we sense satisfaction, sweetness, and the inward presence of the Lord.
[157]  This requirement is so strong that even if we fail and do not follow God s will, we still feel sad and depressed in our spirit when we see others not following God s will.
[158]  TESTING THE REQUIREMENTS OF LIFE Testing the Requirement of Life for Fellowship
[159]  Now we must see something regarding the standard for testing the requirements of life.
[160]  We have spoken of the fact that life requires us to have fellowship.
[161]  However, when we go to a Christian group, the people we meet often do not match us, even though we are open and eager to have fellowship.
[162]  If we live before the Lord, love the Lord, and reject the world and sin, yet we feel uncomfortable and cannot fellowship with them, this shows that they have lost Christ and the ground of the church and that the Holy Spirit is not ruling in them.
[163]  AND THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CROSS Scripture Reading: Eph 2:15-16; Col 3:9-11
[164]  Ephesians 2:15-16 clearly shows that the Lord created the Jews and the Gentiles in Himself into one new man through His death.
[165]  First, the Lord s death on the cross not only accomplished redemption and dealt with our sins, but it also created two peoples, Jews and Gentiles, into one new man.
[166]  Colossians 3:10 tells us that the church is the one new man.
[167]  In this new man there cannot be this one or that one, but Christ is all.
[168]  In the church life we often address each other by our surnames, such as Brother Huang, Brother Chang, and Brother Wu, but actually there should be no Brother Huang, Brother Chang, or Brother Wu in the church, because this is all part of the old man.
[169]  Every saved person should be a Christ-man, a person who is full of Christ inwardly, who is mingled with Christ inwardly, and who is filled with Christ.
[170]  When we touch the church, do we touch Chinese, Japanese, British, or Americans?
[171]  If a church treats people in this way, it should be chastised by God, because all she has is human politics, human tactics, and human methods but not God s principle.
[172]  Romans 11:36 says, Because out from Him and through Him and to Him are all things.
[173]  Those who serve the Lord should have a basic understanding that God requires man to cooperate with Him in His plan.
[174]  Everyone who has a heart to serve the Lord should know this in a fundamental way.
[175]  In creation, God created everything by Himself, and in the final act of creation, God created man.
[176]  When we serve the Lord, it is not enough to be zealous, to give some material offerings, and to pray some prayers; the basic principle of serving the Lord is to see that God does everything in redemption through the mingling of God with man.
[177]  This is quite different from our prayers, which often include the thought that we are nothing and that the Lord can work without us.
[178]  Instead, we should pray, Lord, without us, You cannot work.
[179]  This is a prayer that is according to the truth and according to God s heart.
[180]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN ALL SERVICE BEING INITIATED BY GOD Scripture Reading: Job 38:1-2; 42:1-6 ALL WORK BEING INITIATED BY GOD
[181]  Those who serve the Lord must see that God s redemptive work is accomplished through man s cooperation.
[182]  If we see this, we will have a clearer realization that all our work must be initiated by God, not by us.
[183]  All of us who work for the Lord in various places and all the responsible brothers in the churches must consider how much of our work in serving God is initiated by God and how much is initiated by us.
[184]  Noah did not build an ark because he had a dream and then became zealous.
[185]  Genesis shows that Noah did not have such a thought or idea at any time.
[186]  Rather, God came to Noah one day and told him to build an ark.
[187]  Even the measurements and methods of building the ark were not according to Noah s imagination but to God s determination 6:14-16 .
[188]  In the Old Testament there are many such examples, and we cannot cover all of them.
[189]  Question: The most difficult thing in our service to the Lord is that we do not know how to understand God's will and touch God's word.
[190]  Then the Lord added a few Taiwanese sisters, and we felt that we should visit them, but two brothers said that we should not go.
[191]  The basic matter is that we must fall down because of God's enlightenment and see that our service to God must come from God, not from us.
[192]  We are not speaking of trivial principles but rather about a fundamental issue: In our service to the Lord, we must have a definite experience and come to a clear point of being enlightened by the Lord to see that our service must be of God, not of ourselves.
[193]  In the preceding chapter we saw that all our work must be initiated by God and that we are merely cooperating with Him to meet the need in His heart.
[194]  Hence, we need to carry out all our service by the power of the Lord.
[195]  In chapter 16 the Lord said, Upon this rock I will build My church v. 18 , but in chapter 17 Peter told the Lord that he would make a tent for Him v. 4 . The Lord said that He would build His church, but Peter said that he would make a tent for the Son of God.
[196]  One who serves the Lord must be one who also rises up.
[197]  It may seem contradictory to say that we need to stop and then say that we need to rise up, but it is not.
[198]  We need to restrain our opinions and stop our proposals, but we need to rise up to meet the Lord s need and fulfill the demand in His work.
[199]  God needed man in the person of Jesus Christ to work with Him to accomplish His redemptive work.
[200]  Whenever God wants to do a work, He reveals what He wants to do to man and requires man to stop his opinions and all that he is; then God requires man to cooperate with Him.
[201]  However, in the service of the Lord, we must be strong in every aspect in our spirit, soul, and body.
[202]  After we are saved, we often feel that we are inadequate to meet the Lord s need and cooperate with Him when He wants to use us.
[203]  Do we need a more thorough understanding of some points?
[204]  According to the Lord s word in Matthew 13:18-23, God s word is a seed, and in this seed there is life.
[205]  IN THE MATTER OF SERVICE NEEDING TO BE JOINED TO THE LORD
[206]  One who serves the Lord must do everything by being joined to the Lord, by being in union with the Lord.
[207]  We are often unable to rise up to answer the Lord s demand and meet the Lord s need, but when we are able to rise up to meet the Lord s need, there is a risk of not relying on the Lord.
[208]  It is possible not to rely on the Lord or look to Him because we are able to work according to our own capability, diligence, and earnestness.
[209]  All the work in His redemption is carried out through man, by means of man, and in the mingling with man, and He saves us so that we may serve Him.
[210]  It is difficult for a capable person to rely on God and receive leading.
[211]  CHAPTER NINETEEN THE PRINCIPLE OF GOD S BREAKING Scripture Reading: Acts 13:22, 36
[212]  Strictly speaking, in order to be useful in the Lord s hand and according to God s heart, we must pass through much breaking by God.
[213]  If God does not gain our cooperation, He cannot do anything, and if we want to cooperate with God, everything that we have, according to what we are originally and naturally, must be broken.
[214]  Third, a person who is not broken can never be trusted.
[215]  Such a one cannot be trusted by God or even by the elders and co-workers.
[216]  A person who has not been broken, who has not been torn down by God, is untrustworthy.
[217]  If we are still living in our natural being and have not passed through God s breaking, we cannot be trusted.
[218]  Some saints cannot fall unless they sin; this is God s mercy.
[219]  Our genuine usefulness in God s hand does not depend on our capability, our eloquence, or our intelligence but on how much we have been broken and torn down by God.
[220]  CHAPTER TWENTY GOD S BREAKING, NOT MAN S MAGNANIMITY
[221]  Generally speaking, people think that a person who is in God s hand, who lives in fellowship with God, and who is acceptable to the Lord will prosper in everything and lead a tranquil life.
[222]  Consequently, when we see brothers and sisters suffering afflictions and hardships, we think that they are being disciplined by God because they have committed a big mistake before God.
[223]  Not only is there the example of Job in the Old Testament but also the example of Paul in the New Testament.
[224]  I used to have the concept that a servant of God will not have any trial or lack if he subjects himself to God and is in fellowship with God.
[225]  He was a person full of schemes and plots, but he was broken, torn down, and dealt with by God again and again to the point that God changed his name and called him Israel 32:28 , meaning prince of God.
[226]  If a beggar comes before us, we may not be able to stretch forth our hands to bless him because God does not have much ground in us nor is there a sufficient element of God in us.
[227]  Problems will occur in our homes, in our careers, in our service in the church life, or even in our work for the Lord so that God can build more of Himself into us.
[228]  Hence, we should not have the mistaken concept that by fearing God and living before Him, we will have a smooth way in everything we do and obtain people s praise, glory, and respect.
[229]  When someone admires us, we should put his admiration under our feet, because he may admire us for half a year or a year, but he may also look down on us and slander us one day.
[230]  We should not think that all the saints will admire and respect us because we have been sent by God, called by God, and entrusted with His work.
[231]  Church A: In general, the saints here love the Lord but do not have a solid foundation and, therefore, greatly need guidance.
[232]  The fellowship from these churches shows that there are a few important points that truly need our attention.
[233]  First, in all of the brothers fellowship we should all see the common principle that our work is always based on our person.
[234]  What we gain in the work does not depend on how much we hope and expect; it depends on what we are in our being.
[235]  ON HOW MUCH WE DO BUT ON HOW MUCH WE LEARN
[236]  We should never put the fruit, the result, of our work as the goal.
[237]  Only the Lord knows how many people will be saved through us; we do not know.
[238]  Only the Lord knows how many churches will be helped through us; we do not know.
[239]  We do not know how many churches will be established through us and how many saints will be edified through us; this is up to the Lord.
[240]  However, we should not estimate the effect; we should let God do the estimating, and God s estimation will be determined at the judgment seat in the future.
[241]  Because the workers and serving ones in various places have not made much effort, many saints have not been perfected, and the number of useful people is close to zero.
[242]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO NEEDING TO BE EARNEST AND NOT LOOSE
[243]  Recently, we planted two small trees at the workers home.
[244]  Several full-time serving brothers have moved to a certain place.
[245]  It has been said that this particular locality wastes the most number of people in Taiwan, meaning that many people are not actually being used in God s work.
[246]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE CONCERNING THE CHURCH AND SERVICE OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD
[247]  First, we must acknowledge that all those who believe in the redemption of the Lord s precious blood and who have received the life of God are our brothers and sisters in the Lord, regardless of where they meet or the way that they take.
[248]  We should never think that Christians who do not meet with us do not have the Lord s life, nor can we say that Christians who do not meet with us do not love the Lord.
