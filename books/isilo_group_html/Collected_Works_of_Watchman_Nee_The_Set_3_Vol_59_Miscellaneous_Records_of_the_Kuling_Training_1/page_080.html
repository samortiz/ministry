Nothing in this world can be more beautiful than seeing a group of people who know authority. Among those who know authority, no one makes proposals or suggestions lightly. No one harbors any spirit of rebellion or utters any word of rebellion. When others contact them, they remark, "What a group of truly submissive people!" Within these ones there is not a trace of rebellion. Everyone serves by keeping his own place. When this happens, we will have a glorious day; it will be the kingdom of the Lord among us. The Lord will be able to point to us and say, "At least I have one group of people on earth who will submit to authority." It is true that God has Christ, His Firstborn, who is submissive to Him. He is the firstfruit, but God is waiting for His many sons to render the same testimony of obedience. As long as there is one church that is absolute, that obeys absolutely, and that renders a testimony of submission to God, Satan will be defeated, even if this church is small in number. However, if we operate according to Satan's principle, we will be a laughingstock to him even if we are zealous in our own way. Even if we preach the gospel, suffer for the Lord, accomplish great works, and increase in number, Satan will say, "You are on my side, and together we are against God." This is a sure way to mockery. We should never denigrate ourselves to such a low state as to serve God according to Satan's principles.</p><p>From now on, our feeling concerning the matter of obedience and submission should be different. It should be different from what it was before we came to Foochow. If our feelings remain the same, I have nothing more to say. Our submission must be different. The way is clear. From today forward, we have to learn to bridle our speaking, cut our reasons, and stop making proposals in our mind. This is very crucial. If we set our mind on learning this lesson, God will bless us. When the queen of Sheba beheld Solomon's glory, she had no more spirit in her (1 Kings 10:4-5). When God reveals His glory to us, we will fall down, and spontaneously we will submit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROPER WAY TO SERVE GOD&mdash;FULL SUBMISSION</h2><p>According to the law of Moses, only the Levites were qualified to carry the ark of God. When the Israelites entered Canaan, it was the Levites who carried the ark across the river Jordan. The riverbed was rough, but the ark did not fall (Josh. 3:15-17). When David became king, he wanted to receive the ark into his city, yet he did not inquire of God concerning how it should be carried. He made his own proposal and followed the example of the Philistines by ordering the ark to be carried by an oxcart (1 Sam. 6:7-12). The oxen stumbled, and the ark fell. Uzzah reached out for the ark without a second thought to what he was doing, and God struck him dead (2 Sam. 6:1-7). But even if the ark had not fallen, even if it had remained safely on the cart, it was still not on the shoulders of the Levites. This shows us that God does not want man to make any proposals of his own. In our service we have to obey God. Brothers and sisters, please remember: Either we do not serve God at all, or we should serve without any idea or suggestion of our own. In order to serve our God, we have to submit to authority. We can never come to God with our own opinions. If we hold on to our own opinions, we will never serve God well. We may still claim that we are working for the church or for Christianity, but we cannot say that we are serving God. In order to serve God, we have to take a different way&mdash;the way of full submission. God has to be in control of everything. We cannot propose anything. Our human opinions have to be thoroughly destroyed.</p><p>In talking to many brothers and sisters about their service, I have discovered that many have never been dealt with in their natural disposition, personality, opinion, and thought. Many people are too free in their thoughts. Their thoughts have not been taken captive; they have never touched God's authority. How can a man be brought to the obedience of Christ? Second Corinthians 10 tells us that our thoughts must first be taken captive by the Lord. Instead of acting freely as in the past, we must now allow the Lord to capture our thoughts. We must now be imprisoned by Christ, instead of by the strongholds of our own reasonings. This passage is related to Eve's temptation in Genesis 3. Eve saw that the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was pleasing to the eyes and good for food, and that it would give her wisdom. She began to reason in her heart, and her thoughts went after Satan's will. Her thoughts were taken captive by Satan. This was the beginning of man's fall. Our thoughts are the problem to our service of the Lord. May God grant us the strength to destroy all reasons and to shatter all the things that we consider reasonable. Once the power of God comes, all self-exalted edifices and strongholds will be destroyed, and we will have a captured mind to submit to Him. Unless our thoughts are captured, we can never submit to Him.</p><h2 class="head1">A CHANNEL FOR GOD TO EXPRESS HIS AUTHORITY</h2><p>Second Corinthians 10:6 says, "And we are ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled." How is one's obedience fulfilled? It is fulfilled in the condition prescribed in verse 5, that is, in being taken captive in one's thoughts. When this happens, obedience is fulfilled. It is only as a man's thoughts are taken captive that his obedience is fulfilled. When a man holds on to his opinions and proposals, his obedience is not fulfilled. Paul had worked in Corinth and had witnessed three groups of men there: those who were generally disobedient, those who were obedient, including Paul, and those who were rebellious. God's Word says that when the thoughts of the disobedient ones were taken captive and their obedience was fulfilled, they would join Paul and the obedient ones, whose obedience was already fulfilled. When the two groups of obedient ones would join together, God would execute judgment upon the rebellious ones. I do not know how many obedient ones God will gain. But I believe that when the obedience of some is fulfilled, they will not only render a good testimony but will also afford God a highway through which He can deal with all rebels and rebellions in this world.</p><p>When each of us leaves this place, we have to learn to be captured. We should not seek freedom. Our thoughts have to be captured by Christ. If we allow this to happen, the way before us will be glorious. If throughout this land we find disciplined tongues that are bridled in speech, tempered minds that are free from reasonings, and captured thoughts that are free from self-opinions, God will manifest His authority on earth.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_079.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_081.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 59: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (1) &nbsp; pg 80</div><br></body></html>
