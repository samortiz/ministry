   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DRY BONES IN NEED OF BREATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ezekiel 47 is the house of God, the building of God, but in chapter thirty-seven the Lord's children are pictured as disjointed, dry bones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>None of the bones are joined to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The bones are independent and separate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These dry bones were in the midst of a valley.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The picture here is similar to that of the children of Israel before their exodus from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The last verse of Genesis shows that the children of Israel were in a "coffin in Egypt" 50:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Ezekiel 37 the children of Israel are depicted as being in graves vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The dry bones scattered in the midst of the valley were the bones of slain people v. 9b . Satan was the one who killed and buried them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The dry bones are in need of the air, the breath, to bring them to life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is an expanse of air around the earth that life may exist on this earth to serve God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the Spirit, God is the real air, the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the air is the water, and in the water is the food.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God as life to us is our air, our water, and our food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we breathe, we drink, and when we drink, we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The eating is in the drinking, and the drinking is in the breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, the breathing is in the praising.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we say, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hallelujah!", we breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way to breathe in our wonderful Lord is to say, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we breathe in the Lord in this way, we are watered and our thirst is quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have the sense that we are filled and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can breathe, drink, and eat the Lord by calling, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By saying, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hallelujah!", we get the air, the water, and the food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hymn #255 by A. B. Simpson is a wonderful hymn on breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The chorus of this hymn says:</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am breathing out my sorrow, Breathing out my sin; I am breathing, breathing, breathing, All Thy fulness in.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to breathe Christ in as our breath.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can receive Christ into our inward parts by breathing Him in. THE WIND, THE BREATH, AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to remember that in Ezekiel 37 the wind is the breath, and the breath is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 9 says, "Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord told Ezekiel to say to the wind, "O breath."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that the wind is the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The wind and the breath in this verse are the Hebrew word ruach.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then verse 14 says, "And shall put my Spirit in you."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Spirit in this verse is also ruach.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, the wind is the breath, and the breath is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the Lord blows, He is the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we breathe Him, He is the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When He gets into us, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord comes as the wind, we receive Him as the breath, He gets into us as the Spirit, and the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE BONES COMING TOGETHER WITH NOISE AND SHAKING</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before the Spirit came, we were dry bones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We were not only slain and dried up, but we were also buried in graves and in the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After Ezekiel's prophesying, "There was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone" v. 7 . Before Ezekiel's prophecy, the dry bones were quiet and separate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A cemetery full of dried and buried bones is a quiet place.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our meetings, however, should not be like a cemetery.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we come together, there should be "noise and shaking."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the Spirit as the wind blows upon us, how could we be silent?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our meetings should be full of the proper noise.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There should be a proper noise where everyone speaks, everyone prays, everyone praises, and everyone gives thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Psalms tell us to make a joyful noise unto the Lord 66:1; 81:1; 95:1-2; 98:4, 6; 100:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After the bones came together, "the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them" v. 8 . After the bones came together, the sinews, flesh, and skin covered them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This covering caused their appearance to be much better.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Formerly, they were only dry bones, but now they were a body without breath.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is the marvelous doing of the Lord that the bones could come together without life in them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to interpret Ezekiel 37 in a spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before God came in to renew us and regenerate us, we were like dead and dry bones.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God's salvation is not merely for sinful people but for dead people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because we were dead and dry, we were also scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whether we were unsaved sinners or backslidden believers, our situation was that we were dead and buried in a grave.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many Christians are dead and dry, scattered and disjointed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They are not connected to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord came in to rescue us through the prophesying of His word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As Ezekiel prophesied, the bones came together and the sinews, the flesh, and the skin covered them.</S>
