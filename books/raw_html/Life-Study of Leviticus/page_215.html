<h2 class=head2>B. The Land Yielding Its Rich Produce That the People May Eat the New Food Always  and Dwell Securely in the Land</h2><p>Verses 4b and 5 tell us that if the people obey, “the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will yield their fruit. Your threshing will overtake the vintage, and the vintage will overtake the time of sowing; and you will eat your bread to the full and dwell securely in your land.” Verse 10 goes on to say, “You will eat old store long kept, and clear out the old to make room for the new.” This signifies that we dwell in Christ as our good land and enjoy the riches of Christ for our satisfaction and security. Spiritual satisfaction and security are always the issue of our obedience to God’s warning.<h2 class=head2>C. Peace Being Given in the Land without Threats, Savage Beasts, and the Sword</h2><p>“I will give peace in the land, and you will lie down, and no one will make you afraid. I will eliminate savage beasts from the land, and the sword will not pass through your land” (v. 6). This signifies that the church is normally in a peaceful situation, having no savage beasts (Acts 20:29) or fightings, one with another, among the saints.<h2 class=head2>D. Chasing the Enemies, Five Chasing a Hundred and a Hundred Chasing Ten Thousand</h2><p>“But you will chase your enemies, and they will fall before you by the sword. Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand; and your enemies will fall before you by the sword” (vv. 7-8). This signifies that the church will chase the enemies in the coordination of the Body.<p>According to verse 8, five will chase a hundred and a hundred will chase ten thousand. In the first case each one chases twenty, and in the second case each one chases a hundred. These figures imply the Body life and the coordination of the Body. The greater the coordination, the greater will be our chasing power. This is the Body principle.<h2 class=head2>E. Fruitfulness in Multiplication</h2><p>“I will have regard for you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will confirm My covenant with you” (v. 9). Fruitfulness in multiplication signifies that the church will be fruitful and multiply. The lack of increase or multiplication in the church is a strong sign that before God the church is wrong in some way. If there is no fruitfulness in multiplication, we need to find out what is wrong.<h2 class=head2>F. God’s Dwelling Being among the People</h2><p>“I will make My dwelling among you, and My soul will not abhor you” (v. 11). God’s making His dwelling among the people signifies that God’s dwelling will be built up in the church for God’s delight that He may dwell among His people (cf. 2 Cor. 6:16-18).<h2 class=head1>V. THE DISOBEYING ONES TO BE CHASTISED THAT THEY MAY REPENT</h2><p>In Leviticus 26:14-39 we see that the disobeying ones will be chastised that they may repent. This signifies that the believers who do not walk according to the Spirit but according to the flesh will suffer chastisement, not just once but on many levels with a number of punishments, that they may be forced to repent.
