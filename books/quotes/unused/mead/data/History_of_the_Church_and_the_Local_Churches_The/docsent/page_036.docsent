   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Beginning of the Church Life in Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Brother Nee's Contact with the Brethren</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1926 Brother Nee went to Shanghai to begin the church life there.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Between 1922 and 1927, Brother Nee was invited to minister in many places in Christianity, but after the church in Shanghai was raised up and became strong, he received only a few invitations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From 1927 until Brother Nee went into glory, he was invited only once by the denominations, and that was to a Southern Baptist seminary in my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That was when we first met, and he stayed in my home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1938 and 1939 he was invited to England and Scandinavia by some Christians there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That invitation was in a different category.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the years 1925 through 1927, Brother Nee read some of the writings of the British Brethren, the closed Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we have pointed out, the Brethren were raised up by the Lord around 1825 to 1828, but within about fifteen years, they were divided into three big divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One group was with Darby, which was considered as the exclusive Brethren, the closed Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Another group under the leadership of George M ller was considered as the open Brethren, or Plymouth Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The strictest group was under the leadership of Benjamin Newton, who disagreed with Darby concerning the rapture of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Nee read many of the writings of John Nelson Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These writings were marvelous, and he received much help from them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Due to the help Brother Nee received, the way we conducted our meetings in the early days of the church life was very close to the Brethren way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some even called us the Chinese version of the British Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Nee picked up all the good points from different kinds of Christian practices and put them together in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Brethren, especially in England, found out that there was a group of Christians who had been raised up by the Lord in a wonderful way, so they started to correspond with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then they proposed that they would send some to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Nee agreed to receive them, but he told them not to bring in their background.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They promised they would not do this, so they came to Shanghai in 1931.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This group of closed Brethren was considered to be the best among the Brethren at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A brother by the name of James Taylor was their teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Elden Hall, which was the first hall of the church in Los Angeles, was originally their hall.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We bought Elden Hall from James Taylor's son in 1965.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Among the ones that came to Shanghai were Charles Barlow and W.J. House.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These two were the speakers among them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead of coming to us as simple believers according to their agreement, they brought the so-called Brethren practice with them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This caused much trouble, and this was a hard situation for Brother Nee to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They invited Brother Nee to visit them, and he did in 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He traveled through France and stayed in England for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A brother in England brought him to the United States and to Vancouver, Canada.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>James Taylor wrote many letters, and there is a record of his correspondence with Brother Nee during this time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In that same year Brother Nee returned to China from Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>During that time I was fully brought into the work in Shanghai with him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He personally told me everything concerning his visit abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Brethren promised him that if he would take their way, they would buy him some land to build a big hall in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They also promised him other things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said "no" to all their proposals.</S>
