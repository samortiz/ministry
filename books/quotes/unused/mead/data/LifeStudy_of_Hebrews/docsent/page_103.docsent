   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. From the Outer Court on Earth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to the Holy of Holies in Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This turn is from the outer court on earth to the Holy of Holies in heaven 8:2; 9:11-12, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This reminds us of the arrangement of the furniture in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Firstly, there was the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then there was the tabernacle, which was divided into two parts the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies where God s presence was.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, there were three parts: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the type, both the outer court and the Holy Place are for the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The purpose in entering the outer court is to come through the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both the outer court and the Holy Place are for the people to come into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The outer court is for people to enter the Holy of Holies, and the Holy Place is the threshold of the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you come to the outer court without entering into the Holy of Holies, you are aimless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you remain around the altar and the laver for a long time, you have no aim or destination.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Neither the altar nor the laver in the outer court is the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The goal is the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever you are at the altar or at the laver you must aim for the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even when you are in the Holy Place you should say, Lord, I am not for this place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am passing through this place to the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My aim, my goal, is Your Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The book of Hebrews firstly presents us the things in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then, beginning at 7:1, it turns us to the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the turn from the outer court through the Holy Place to the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. From the Altar for Sin in the Outer Court</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>to the Propitiation-cover for Grace</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>the Throne of Grace in the Holy of Holies</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This turn is also from the altar for sin in the outer court to the propitiation-cover for grace the throne of grace in the Holy of Holies 13:10, 12; 10:12; 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we see two things the altar and the propitiation-cover.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The propitiation-cover is the throne of grace where God meets with us, speaks with us, and communes with us, and where we are one with God in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The throne of grace is the very place where God and we, we and God, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The altar is in the outer court, and the propitiation-cover is in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The altar symbolizes the cross, which is dear and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The altar is dear and precious because it deals with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But it is in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The cross, on which the problem of sin was solved is still on the earth, on the ground floor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While many Christians are occupied continually with the cross in the outer court, I doubt if many Christians properly touch the propitiation-cover hourly or even daily.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all need to learn to touch the throne of grace, the propitiation-cover, moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to pray, Lord, I need to touch Your throne of grace every minute.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The throne of grace is the place where we must be.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The cross is good, but it is not our goal or destination.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not the place where we should remain forever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The place where we should remain forever is the propitiation-cover, the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Where are you right now?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are around the propitiation-cover, around the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Bible we are never told that God speaks from the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the Bible, where do we hear God s voice?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the throne of grace, the oracle in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you are still around the cross, it will be difficult for you to hear God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But whenever you come to the throne of grace, the propitiation-cover, you will immediately hear the divine voice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You will hear God s voice because you are in the oracle, at the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is here that we hear God s speaking, see His countenance, and enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is here that we are one with Him in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So the book of Hebrews turns us from the altar in the outer court to the place of God s oracle in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the throne of grace, it is no longer a question of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sin is under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the throne of grace, it is a matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Are you still occupied with sin?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Are you still entangled and troubled by your temper?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although you might have lost your temper with your wife this morning, now, as you are reading this message, you can be at the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A few hours ago you were under sin, but now you are with grace over sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>None of us should be occupied with sin any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sin is over.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all need to be occupied, filled, saturated, and permeated with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hallelujah for grace!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Are you now around the cross or around the throne of grace?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to be brothers and sisters around the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Grace is God Himself flowing into, through, and out of us to do everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Have you not enjoyed grace in this way, as the very God flowing into, through, and out of you to do everything for you?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the grace that we enjoy around the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We all must know grace in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The ministry of the book of Hebrews is simply to turn us to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Through the rich church life, the Lord has brought us to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I do not like to linger around the cross any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, I am not saying that we should give up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I am saying that we should not linger at the cross but stay at the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I would like to linger here at the throne of grace for eternity.</S>
