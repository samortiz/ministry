   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESIDING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to spend more time to see some of the crucial points in verses 9 through 13.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first crucial matter in these verses is the indwelling or the residing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 9 reads, But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if anyone has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may also translate the word dwells into the word reside.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To reside is even a stronger word than to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a very great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You are such a small being, yet in you there is another One residing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even up until today, perhaps Paul was the only other Christian who ever paid adequate attention to this matter: that in you as a tripartite man, as a human being, another One is residing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We know this doctrinally, but we have not paid adequate attention to the fact that there is such a One residing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some Christians today teach that Jesus Christ is in the heavens, not in you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They say that He has a representative in us, the Holy Ghost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And they argue with us because we are so strong in sounding the trumpet that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to say that not only does Christ live in us, but He is also being formed in us, and He is making His home in us Gal 2:20; 4:19; Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are strong clear words from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am afraid, though, that we may not realize adequately in a practical and living way that a wonderful One is now residing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul says, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells or resides in you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first thing these few verses stress is the residing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And today under God s enlightenment we have seen that this residing Spirit is just the ultimate expression of the Triune God, who after being processed, has become our life and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the residing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not just a Ghost.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Surely in verse 11 when Paul uses the phrase the Spirit of the One Who raised Jesus from among the dead, it does not indicate a ghost.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It indicates the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why does Paul use such a long and complicated composition?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because his intention is to show us that this Spirit is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the Spirit of the One who raised up Jesus from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Spirit is such a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now the Spirit is the very expression, the ultimate expression, of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jesus was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even this short sentence implies a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jesus implies incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without incarnation how could Jesus have come into being?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the universe Jesus is a special name.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the entire human history Jesus is extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even the calendar on this earth is the calendar of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This year, 1982, is the year of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even Gog and Magog, or Russia, and even Red China, these atheistic nations, use the calendar of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you use the calendar of Caesar, you become a Roman.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you use the calendar of a czar, you become a Russian.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if you use the calendar of Jesus, you become Jesus people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The entire world today is under the calendar of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there had been no incarnation, how could Jesus have come into being?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, if there had not been such a human living of thirty-three and a half years, how could you have a complete Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today our Jesus is complete and even completed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was incarnated, and He lived on this earth, not for three and a half hours, but for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then He was raised.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus implies incarnation and human living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Raised implies death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If He were not put to death how could He be raised?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>So the little word raised implies both death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Who did all this?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The One!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is One in the universe who did this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have to realize that it is not just the Father, but the One!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Just to say the Father is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The One is very implicative.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The One implies a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the universe there is such a One!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have to realize that in the whole universe there is such a One who raised up, and this dear One is not merely in the heavens; this dear One today is within you as the residing One.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is not only the One who raised Jesus, but He is also the One who resides in you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The raising One is now the residing One.</S>
