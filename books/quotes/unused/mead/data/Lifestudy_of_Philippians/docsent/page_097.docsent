   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR TO LIVE CHRIST BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21; John 14:17-20; 6:57, 63; 2 Cor 3:6b, 17a; Gal 5:25; 1 Thes 5:17-19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During my early years as a Christian, no one told me what was the goal of being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of course I was taught that we were saved in order to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The impression I received was that the purpose of being a Christian was simply to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Heaven supposedly is the destiny ordained by God for all who believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, I eventually came to see that the goal of being a Christian is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, the destiny God has ordained for us in His economy also is that we might live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is our way, our goal, our destiny, and our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I do not believe that even as recently as 1970 Christians were familiar with the term live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This expression was not known even among us in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We had heard of living for Christ, living out Christ, and living by Christ, but not of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a new term.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To live by Christ and for Christ and to live Christ out are all somewhat different from simply living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can be helped to know what it means to live Christ by reading the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This Gospel reveals that Christ, the Word, is God 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One day, the Word became flesh 1:14 ; that is, God was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Referring to the Word made flesh, John the Baptist declared, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The third chapter of the Gospel of John speaks of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we see that we must be born of God through the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In John 14 the Lord Jesus said, He who has seen Me has seen the Father v. 9 . The Lord also went on to say, I am in the Father and the Father is in Me v. 11 . The Lord Jesus was one with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To see Him was to see the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this chapter the Lord Jesus also spoke of the Spirit of reality, telling the disciples that the Spirit of reality abode with them and would be in them v. 17 . The Lord Jesus indicated that when the Spirit of reality came, He Himself would come also.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 19 says, Because I live, you shall live also.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 20 continues, In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here we have our living together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are in Christ, and Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that we and He live together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He lives, and we live also.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We live in Him, by Him, and with Him, and we even live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In John 15 the Lord gives the very impressive illustration of the vine and the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He says, I am the vine, you are the branches v. 5 . The branches are the very living of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>RECEIVING THE HOLY BREATH</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the Lord Jesus entered into resurrection, He came to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to John 20:22, He breathed on them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Greek word for Spirit, pneuma, also means breath.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that the Lord Jesus was telling the disciples to receive the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Gospel of John begins with the Word and goes on to speak of the Lamb and the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Finally, in John 20:22 we see that the very One who is the Word, God, the Lamb, and the vine is also the breath for us to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, He breathed out; on the other hand, the disciples breathed in.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 20:22 the Lord Jesus told the disciples to receive the holy breath, the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not analyze the breath, but receive it by breathing it into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Unfortunately, many of today s Christians know only to reason and consider; they do not have any experience of breathing the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A. B. Simpson was one who knew the experience of breathing in of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The opening lines of one of his hymns read: O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me, Teach me how to breathe Thee in Hymns, #255 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Gospel of John we have a record of the divine process.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Word, who was God, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, having passed through crucifixion and resurrection, He became the holy breath for us to breathe in.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we see the steps of this process, we shall have a proper and thorough understanding of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to John 1:1 and 14, the Word, who was in the beginning with God and who is God, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In verse 29 we see that this Word become flesh is the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the one hand, He is the Lamb for accomplishing redemption; on the other hand, He is the tree for imparting life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, we may speak of Him as the Lamb-tree.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to John 15, the branches of the vine are the living of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ultimately, the Lamb-tree becomes the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In our experience we have Christ as the Word, the Lamb, the tree, and the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Word is for expression, the Lamb is for redemption, the tree is for the impartation of life, and the breath is for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We cannot live without breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead of saying that a certain person has died, the Chinese say that he has stopped breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No doubt, to stop breathing is to die.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, to keep on breathing is to live.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No matter how many schools we may graduate from, we can never graduate from breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No one can say that because he has become so knowledgeable or mature, it is no longer necessary for him to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, the older a person becomes, the more concerned he may be about his breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How marvelous that for our spiritual life we have the holy breath for our living!</S>
