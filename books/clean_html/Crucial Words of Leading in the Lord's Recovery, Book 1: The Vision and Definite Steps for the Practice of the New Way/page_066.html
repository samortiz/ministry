<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO MEET IN THE HOMES</h2>
<p>We all need to learn how to have meetings with people in their homes. The co-workers need to learn, the elders need to learn, and the full-timers need to learn. In particular, the sisters need to learn. We should learn to go to people&rsquo;s homes to have meetings with them. We do not need to wait until they have the burden and the desire. As long as one is a believer and as long as he or she has a home, we need to work on the home. If they do not know how to have a meeting, we should lead them and teach them to do it. If for any reason they have difficulty starting a meeting, we should help them. We should continue persistently time after time until they are able to sustain a meeting in their home. After that we can hand the meeting over to them. Such meetings are not primarily for the relatives and neighbors but for the members of the family, especially for the husbands and wives. Perhaps the couple has not been meeting for a long time. As long as we bring the meeting to their home, they will be touched by the Lord to start meeting again. This is one lesson that all the co-workers, elders, and full-timers must learn.</p>
<p>I would also speak a word of advice to the co-workers and elders. In the past we were accustomed to taking care of the big meetings. Now we have a new way. We are asking everyone to work on the small meetings. In other words, we need to work on every saint&rsquo;s home. Not only must we recover the dormant ones, but we must also recover their homes. Although many brothers and sisters are not co-workers, elders, or full-timers, they do have a heart for the Lord. There are about three thousand such saints in Taipei. If they all form units of three, we will have one thousand units which can carry out meetings in others&rsquo; homes. Every Saturday we will have one thousand teams of saints looking for people to work on, whether they are dormant ones, weak ones, or indifferent ones. We can even send a meeting to the home of a gospel friend. We will not graduate by doing this only once. Such a practice must be sustained in a steadfast way. In the process of doing this, we must learn to take care of other things, such as the arrangement of chairs, the provision of food, and the preparation of the refreshments. We also must learn to choose the hymns and exercise to follow the leading of the Spirit. If we do this, I believe the result will be more than we can think or imagine.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Helping Every Attendant to Function</h2>
<p>Another secret to the success of the small group meeting or home meeting is the singing. This is especially crucial among the older ones, those who are more than forty years of age. We have many good hymns among us. Many times we do not need to sing the entire hymn; we can sing only one stanza. When we go to a home meeting, our singing with a released spirit will stir up the meeting. The most crucial thing is to help every attendant of the meeting to function. We can take the lead to pray and afterward ask the brothers and sisters to pray one by one. If some express reluctance, we can help them along. We can also encourage them to give a testimony of their salvation and to tell the story of their experience of the Lord&rsquo;s grace. This will rekindle the love for the Lord within them and fire them up. It will also stir up the heart of the listeners.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning to Use Proper Material</h2>
<p>Every time we have a home meeting, we must provide the proper material for the supply of life. We must all learn to use such material. Do not be legal or inflexible in using the material. At times we may come to deep and lofty points. Depending on the actual need, we may want to skip over some of these points or cover them in a brief way. Any Scripture reference listed at the beginning of a lesson or chapter should be pray-read. Ultimately, we still need the supply of the Lord&rsquo;s word for spiritual nourishment. If we do this, the meetings will become living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preparing before Going to the Home Meetings</h2>
<p>Before we go to a home meeting, we need to pray before the Lord, confess to Him, and ask for His cleansing. We need to wash our hands every day. We cannot say that since we washed our hands yesterday, we do not need to wash them again today. Nor can we say that since we washed them this morning, we can skip it for now. Every time we contact the Lord, and every time we touch anything concerning the Lord, we need to confess our sins and ask Him for His cleansing. We do this not as a formality. We confess our filth, weakness, lack, corruption, and evil from the bottom of our heart. Whether they are conscious sins or unconscious sins, we must ask the Lord to forgive and cleanse them one by one.</p>
<p>The result of such prayer, confession, and supplication for cleansing is the moving and outpouring of the Holy Spirit. We have to believe that the Spirit of the Lord today is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. He is all-inclusive. He lives within us and is also upon us. After we confess our sins and ask for forgiveness, He will cleanse us with His precious blood (1 John 1:7, 9). After such confession, we must exercise our faith to claim His Spirit. We must believe that He is within us and is also upon us. We also must believe that every time we are with the brothers and sisters, His presence is with us. In Matthew 28:20 the Lord says, &ldquo;I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.&rdquo; This Lord who is with us is the Spirit. If He is not the Spirit, how can He be with us? The Lord who is with us in the meetings is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Once the Lord cleanses us, we must stand on this fact. Based on this faith, we should exercise our spirit in the meetings. Whether it is singing, praying, speaking, or fellowshipping, the minute we open our mouth, we need to learn to exercise our spirit. Our meeting is not a common thing. It is a holy matter. Whenever we meet, we touch God. For this reason, we must exercise our spirit. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; According to my observation, when the brothers and sisters come together, most of the time they do not exercise their spirit; they do not worship in spirit and truthfulness. This is our greatest lack.</p>
<p>Chinese philosophy extols &ldquo;inward substance&rdquo; over &ldquo;outward show&rdquo; so that even if a person is filled with &ldquo;inward substance,&rdquo; he should behave outwardly as if nothing has happened. To the Chinese, this is virtue and valor. But such &ldquo;valor&rdquo; should not be found in our meetings. In the meetings we need to have inward substance, and we need to have outward expression. Fifty years ago the most famous preacher in China was John Sung, who did not graduate from any theological school. He received a doctoral degree in chemistry in the United States. When he returned to China, he was called by the Lord to preach the gospel. Around February or March of 1933, he came to Chefoo. I went purposely to listen to him. He was like a madman. He would come in either from the front door or from the back door. Sometimes while everyone was waiting for him, he would suddenly appear and would sing in a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;Down with sin, down with sin; out with Satan, out with Satan!&rdquo; At that time, even Christian congregations of a thousand people would be completely silent for the entire meeting. But the minute John Sung sang in this way, every dormant spirit was awakened. When we go to a meeting, we should do the same; we should stir up other people&rsquo;s spirit.</p>
<p>We must realize that with whatever part of our being we speak, we will touch that same part in others. If we speak in a joyful way, others will rejoice. If we speak in anger, others will be led to anger. If we speak with our emotion, we will touch others&rsquo; emotion. If we speak with the will, we will touch others&rsquo; will. Of course, if we speak with our spirit, we will touch others&rsquo; spirit. This is an invariable rule. When we go to the meeting, we are there only for one thing&mdash;to do God&rsquo;s business. We are there to stir up people&rsquo;s spirit. If we do not exercise our spirit, others&rsquo; spirit will never be stirred up. If their spirit is not stirred up, they will not touch God, and they will not receive any supply. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit. When we go to the meeting, we need to exercise our spirit. We must always exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>Some saints are always strong. They are always ready to speak and can exercise their spirit without any encouragement from us. But the majority of the saints need encouragement before they will exercise their spirit. When we go to a meeting, that is, when we deliver a meeting to a person&rsquo;s home, the minute we come and the minute we open our mouth, we need to exercise our spirit. Once we exercise our spirit, the meeting will be full of the Spirit. Once we speak with the spirit, others&rsquo; spirit will be opened, and they will touch God.</p>
