   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FIFTY-THREE CHRIST HIS PERSON 33</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover more aspects of what Christ is in His person to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>23.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Way</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His person Christ is the believers' way to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 14:4 the Lord Jesus says, "You know where I go, and you know the way."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Notice that the Lord uses the words "where" and "way."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 5 Thomas replies, "Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the Lord answers, "I am the way no one comes to the Father except through Me" v. 6 . This verse reveals that Christ is the way and indicates that the "where" is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the way is a living person, the Son, so the place must also be a living person, God the Father Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, both the way and the where are living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The way is the Son, and the where, the place, is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To have Christ as our way to the Father means that when we take Christ, we get the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we walk in Christ as the way, we arrive at the destination, which is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, we take Christ as the way and we reach the Father as the place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The living way for us to get into God the Father, the living place, is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus does not say, "No one comes to heaven except through Me."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He says, "No one comes to the Father except through Me."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ's intention is not to bring us into heaven but to bring us into God, into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is not the way to bring the believers into heaven; He is the way to bring the believers into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through the Son's death and resurrection we have been brought into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Son is in the Father, and we also are in the Father because we are in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Father is holy and dwells in unapproachable light 1 Tim 6:16 , and we are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are also involved with the world, Satan, and other negative things, all of which are obstacles that make it impossible for us to come to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sin, the world, and Satan are three great obstacles that make access to the Father impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is impossible for us to overcome these negative things and to clear the way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we need Christ as the way to the Father, as the means by which we may come to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through His death on the cross the Lord Jesus dealt with sin, the world, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that He has cleared away all the negative things, all the obstacles, between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now, having dealt with the negative things, Christ Himself is our way to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We simply need to enter into Christ, and He will bring us to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through His death Christ cleared the path, and now He Himself becomes our way, the only way, into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we get into Christ as the way, we arrive at the Father as our destination, because the Son is one with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, to be in the Son is also to be in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once we are in Christ Jesus, there is no longer any distance between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because we are in Christ we are immediately brought into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not a mere doctrine; it is a spiritual fact.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately in the Triune God in an experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is the unique way for us to enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As believers we can testify that we have God and that we enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The way by which we enter into God the Father is the crucified and resurrected Christ with His redemption John 14:2b-3; Heb 10:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ has taken away sin, He has judged the world, He has destroyed Satan, and He has terminated the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now there are no longer any obstacles between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we call on the Lord, we are immediately in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We experience the fact that God is in us and that we are one with Him, and then God becomes our enjoyment through the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ephesians 2:18 says, "Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indicates that through Christ as the way we have access in the Spirit unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we call, "O Lord Jesus," we have the sense that we are in the presence of God and that God is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This life-giving Spirit is now the access for us to touch God the Father and to enter into Him.</S>
