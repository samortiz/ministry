the Marriage Dinner of the Lamb</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:9 says, &ldquo;And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they who are invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb.&rdquo; This is the time of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. At the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, the overcoming believers will enjoy the marriage supper of the Lamb. At the marriage supper of the Lamb, the believers will enjoy a special portion of Christ. A wedding feast is not ordinary food but a special portion. The Lord Himself by that time will be a special portion for us to enjoy.</p>
<p>The Christian life starts with a wedding feast, continues with His table week after week until He comes, and at the time He comes, we will have a marriage supper. The entire Christian life from the beginning to the end is the enjoyment of a feast. Do we enjoy the Lord all the time in our Christian life? Do we feast and feast again and again in our Christian life? The Christian life is a life of feasting. It starts with feasting, continues with feasting, and ends with feasting. We will feast on the Lord eternally.</p>
<p>Instead of feasting on the Lord all day, it may be that we are striving. Even in the battlefield, however, the Lord prepares a table before us in the presence of our enemies (Psa. 23:5). While we are fighting, we are feasting. If we do not know how to feast, we could never fight properly. Only those who know how to feast on the Lord, know how to fight for the Lord. The Christian life is a life of enjoyment. In 1958 I was in a conference in Denmark. One day the leading brother there said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, do you worry? To me you are always happy. Don&rsquo;t you have some troubles?&rdquo; I do have troubles, but my secret is that I am a feasting Christian. In myself I should be sorrowful, but in Him there is a real feast. Try to be a feasting Christian, not a striving Christian.</p>
<p>We need to see that the Christian life is a feasting life. We are destined and ordained to feast on the Lord. When I was young, my pastor told me that we were appointed by God to suffer. That frightened me. Later on in my Christian life I found out that we all have to pass through sufferings, but we are destined and ordained by God to feast on Him. The beginning of the Christian life is a feast, the continuation of the Christian life is a table, and the consummation of the Christian life is an eternal feast. May the Lord be gracious to us so that we may begin to feast on Him day by day. Come to the table! Come and feast!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD</h2>
<p>Now we come to the practical point of how to feast. According to the biblical revelation, the Lord is the Spirit and the living Word. John 6:63 and 2 Corinthians 3:6 tell us that it is the Spirit that gives life. Who is this Spirit? First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord is the Spirit that gives life, and this life-giving Spirit is the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ. Christ by His death and resurrection became a life-giving Spirit. As food to us, as a feast to us, Christ is the life-giving Spirit. Our food is the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit is abstract like the air, but the Word is concrete. In John 6:63 the Lord also said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; In our concept we always consider that the Word of God involves knowledge and teachings in letters. But the Lord tells us that His words are spirit. The word of the Lord is spirit. Second Timothy 3:16 says that &ldquo;all Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; This indicates that the Scripture, the Word of God, is the breath of God. Hence His Word is spirit, <em>pneuma,</em> or breath.</p>
<p>We should not consider the Scripture to be merely in letters. The Scripture is the breath of life. The words spoken by the Lord are spirit because the Lord Himself is the Spirit. Thus, whatever is breathed out of Him must be spirit. We have to change our concept. The word does not equal knowledge but spirit. The words the Lord speaks to us are spirit, not knowledge, and all Scripture is the breath of God. The Lord Himself is in the Word, and He Himself is even called the Word. In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God (John 1:1), and God is Spirit (4:24). The Lord is the Word, and the Word is the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO TOUCH THE WORD</h2>
<p>A newspaper is composed of material in black and white, in letter only. When we read the newspaper, we must exercise our eyes to read and our mind to understand. But we cannot and should not deal with the Word of God in this way. The Word of God needs our eyes to read, but it is not for our eyes to read. It needs our mind to understand, but it is not for our mind to understand. The eyes are the members of the physical body, and the mind is the main part of the soul. But the Word is for our spirit to receive and digest. After we read and understand the Word, we have to exercise our spirit to take the Word. The Word is not for our eyes to read nor for our mind to understand, but for our spirit to feed on. If we do not exercise our spirit while reading the Word, the Bible is the tree of knowledge to us and not the tree of life. The same Bible may be a book of knowledge to one person or a book of life to another person. Whether it is a book of knowledge or a book of life depends on what organ we use to deal with this book.</p>
<p>After I received the Lord as a young man, for at least seven years I contacted the Bible without realizing I needed to exercise my spirit to touch the Lord in the Word. No one ever helped me to realize that I had to exercise my spirit to deal with this spiritual book. I was never taught in this way. Thus, the more I studied this book merely with my mind, the more dead I became. The more I studied, the more I was filled with dead letters, dead knowledge. We have to exercise our spirit to deal with this living Word and to touch the Word. Then the Word becomes spirit. When it becomes spirit, it becomes life. When it becomes life, it is the food, the supply of life, to us.</p>
<p>When we come to the Word, we have to read it with our eyes and understand it with our mind, but there is no need for us to exercise our mind too much. Our mind has been over-exercised. Even when we are sleeping, our mind is still exercised because we dream. If we do not understand something when we are reading the Word, we should not be bothered. After we understand something, however, we have to exercise our spirit to touch that portion of the Word by the way of prayer. Right away we have to pray about what we understand and pray with what we understand.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Tree of Life &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
