   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If the spirit is poisoned, and the poison is not quickly dealt with, it will turn into sins in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sins in the spirit are more serious than any other sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But turning, He rebuked them and said, You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" Luke 9:54-55 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The kind of spirit we have is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times our spirit is stirred up by Satan, and we do not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once the spirit errs, everything else errs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we consider the experience of the two disciples, we can see that a wrong spirit is very easily detected in our words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the words probably do not reveal as much as one's tone of voice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many times the words may be right, but the tone is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we want to overcome, we have to take care of the tone in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once evil spirits touch our spirit, our tone will lose its gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All harsh voices, rash voices, and sharp voices do not come from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, they are a sign that the ones with these voices have already been stirred up by Satan's poisons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How do we ordinarily speak?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we speak about others, can we speak without any sense of condemnation?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps what we say is true, but a spirit of criticism, condemnation, wrath, and jealousy may be lurking behind truthful words.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should speak the truth in love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If our spirit is pure and meek, we can speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if a spirit of condemnation is lurking behind our words, we are committing a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sin is not only an act, but also a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spirit behind all of our actions is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times we can be working for God or man and committing sins at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The work may be done, but a spirit of dishonesty, unwillingness, or grudge is hidden behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should maintain our spirit in a sweet and tender condition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our spirit should be clean and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do we consider a wrong spirit a sin?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When does the enemy attack our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When is our spirit poisoned?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we know about sins, will we remove them humbly?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we detect a hardening of our tone, we should immediately stop and not go on.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should immediately say to others, "I would rather say the same words with a clean spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I would rather oppose the enemy."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are not willing to tell our brothers that we are wrong, our spirit retains its sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Believers should learn to guard their spirit from the provocation of the enemy and to guard their spirit in sweetness and gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ordinarily a believer should have the shield of faith for the quenching of the flaming darts of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that he should exercise a living faith to oppose the attacks of the enemy and should trust in God's protection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Faith is our shield; it is not our extracting pliers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is for quenching the fiery darts, not for pulling them out.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If believers are hit by the darts, they should immediately remove the cause of the fiery darts and take up an opposing stand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They should immediately reject everything from the enemy and pray for God's cleansing.</S>
