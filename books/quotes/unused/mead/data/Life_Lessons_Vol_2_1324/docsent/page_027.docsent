   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GOAL OF SERVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Building up the Body of Christ "Out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love" Eph 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This word shows us that our coordination and service with the saints is to cause the growth of the Body of Christ and to build it up in love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Besides saving sinners, perfecting the saints, and glorifying God 1 Cor 10:31 , our serving the Lord as His slaves is, even the more, to cause the Body of Christ to grow and be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>V. THE REWARD FOR SERVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 Being honored by God the Father "If anyone serves Me the Lord Jesus the Father God will honor him" John 12:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For our service to the Lord, we shall be honored by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What a reward this is!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2 Being blessed to sit at the feast and enjoying the Lord's serving "Blessed are those slaves whom the lord when he comes shall find watching he will gird himself and will have them recline at the table, and he will come and serve them" Luke 12:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This verse says that when the Lord comes back, the slaves who have been watchful to serve the Lord will be blessed to sit at the feast and will enjoy the Lord's serving.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is also a great reward from the Lord to those who serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3 Ruling with the Lord and enjoying the joy of the Lord "Well done, good and faithful slave I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your Lord" Matt 25:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse says that the good and faithful slave who serves the Lord will be set over many things and enter into the manifestation of the coming kingdom and into the joy of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely this is a great reward, which we should appreciate and long for.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE PUNISHMENT FOR NOT SERVING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1 Receiving many lashes "And that slave who knew his lord's will, and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes" Luke 12:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord's word here clearly and seriously tells us that if we who are the Lord's slaves do not serve Him according to His will, when He comes we will receive many lashes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To receive lashes is to be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord did not tell us how the punishment will be carried out, but any punishment, especially that which is repeated many times, is dreadful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May we who have received grace to be the Lord's slaves to serve Him be admonished and warned because of His word.</S>
