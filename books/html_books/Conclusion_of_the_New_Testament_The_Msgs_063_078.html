If we have from the pure Word the proper knowledge of Christ&#8217;s person and work, we shall not be misled. Having covered Christ in His person, attributes, and virtues, we shall go on to consider Christ&#8217;s work. We begin with His work in creation.<h2 class=head1>A. IN CREATION</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Creating the Heavens and the Earth</h2><p>Since God is the Creator of all things and since Christ is God, Christ is the Creator of all things. Hebrews 1:10, a quotation from Psalm 102:25, is applied to Christ and indicates that, as God, Christ created the heavens and the earth: &#8220;You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.&#8221; As the Creator of the heavens and the earth, Christ is the origination and the source of all the created things. This proves that He is the very God who is over all and is blessed forever (Rom. 9:5b). His creation of the heavens and of the earth began the fulfillment of God&#8217;s eternal plan to carry out God&#8217;s intention to have a full expression in man in the universe.<h2 class=head2>2. In Him and through Him All Things Being Created</h2><p>Colossians 1:16 says, &#8220;In Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.&#8221; &#8220;In Him&#8221; means in the power of Christ&#8217;s person. All things were created in the power of what Christ is. Furthermore, &#8220;in Him&#8221; implies that Christ is both the sphere and the element of creation. All things were created in Christ as the sphere and the element. &#8220;Through Him&#8221; indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was processed. Therefore, the process of creation was carried out in Christ and through Christ.<p>Christ is related to creation in a subjective way. He did not create the universe merely in an objective way as an objective Creator. He did not, so to speak, stand apart and call everything into being. On the contrary, the process of creation took place in Him, that is, in the power of His person. Christ is the unique power in the universe. His person is this power. Therefore, creation was processed in Him. This means that He was not merely an objective Creator but also the subjective instrument through which creation was processed. Creation took place in the power of Christ&#8217;s person and through Him as the active instrument.<p>Christ is not only the Creator but also the One who is the means through whom all things came into being. Speaking of Christ, John 1:3 says, &#8220;All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being.&#8221; Here we see that creation came into being through Christ. For all things to come into being through Him and for nothing to come into being apart from Him means that apart from Him nothing has existence. One day, through Christ as the means, all things came into being. Therefore, Christ is both the Creator and the means by which and through which all things were created.<h2 class=head2>3. Upholding All Things</h2><p>Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ upholds &#8220;all things by the word of His power.&#8221; After creating all things, Christ became the Upholder of all things. For instance, after Christ created the earth, which has nothing visible supporting it, He began to uphold it, and He upholds it now by the word of His power. Christ upholds all things, and He upholds them very easily simply by speaking. The universe is upheld by the word of Christ&#8217;s power. Therefore, Christ is not only the Creator and the means of creation but also the Upholder. He created the universe, and now He upholds it by His powerful word.<p>Speaking of Christ, Colossians 1:17 says, &#8220;All things subsist together in Him.&#8221; For all things to subsist together in Christ means that they exist together by Christ as the holding center, just as the spokes of a wheel are held together by the hub at their center. The word &#8220;subsists&#8221; in Colossians 1:17 implies to exist, to live, and to live together. All things not only exist in Christ but also live, or continue in existence, in Him. Furthermore, all things exist together in Him. The universe subsists in Christ as the center. All things not only exist in Him; all things also live in Him and live together corporately in Him.<h2 class=head1>B. IN INCARNATION</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Bringing God into Man</h2><p>Through His work in incarnation Christ did something marvelous-He brought God into man (John 1:1, 14). If we study the Gospel of Luke thoroughly and deeply, we shall see that the incarnation of Christ was not only for the producing of the Savior. Actually, the incarnation of Christ brought divinity into humanity. This means that Christ&#8217;s incarnation was a great work to bring God into man. Only when we are in eternity shall we have a full understanding of how much was involved and implied in Christ&#8217;s incarnation. It is commonly thought that the incarnation was simply a matter of the Holy Spirit coming upon Mary for the conception and birth of the Lord Jesus. But much more than this was taking place. When the Lord Jesus was conceived, a great work was taking place to bring God into man.<p>It was surely a marvelous thing for God to come into man by means of Christ&#8217;s work in incarnation and to be born of mankind through a virgin. In creation God was the Creator. But though He created all things, He did not enter into any of the things He created. Even in creating man God only breathed the breath of life into him (Gen. 2:7). He was still outside man. His breath, according to Job 33:4, gave man life; however, He Himself did not come into man. Until the incarnation He was separate from man. But through Christ&#8217;s work in incarnation God was brought into man. He was first conceived and then remained in the virgin&#8217;s womb for nine months, after which He was born. What a great work this was!<p>God was brought into man through the conception of the Lord Jesus. That conception involved a process, a procedure, that brought God into man. Therefore, when Jesus was born, the God-man was born. It is crucial for us to realize that not only was a human child born, but God Himself was involved in that birth.<p>We should not think that when the Lord Jesus was conceived within Mary&#8217;s womb God was far away in the heavens and that when the Lord Jesus was about to be delivered God came upon Him and made Him the God-man. Such an understanding is too objective and outward. Christ&#8217;s incarnation involved the intrinsic essence of both divinity and humanity. His conception was of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20), and the Holy Spirit is God Himself. When the Holy Spirit came upon Mary (Luke 1:35), He did not come upon her merely in an outward way, but came into her in a way that involved the divine essence intrinsically. The divine essence of (literally, out of), the Holy Spirit was generated in Mary&#8217;s womb to conceive the Lord Jesus.<p>Just as every conception is a mingling, Christ&#8217;s conception was also a mingling, the mingling of the divine essence with the human essence in one entity, the wonderful person of Christ. His conception of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin, accomplished with both the divine and human essences, constitutes a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, producing the God-man. In Christ, the God-man, these two essences are brought together not in union but in mingling.<p>This mingling was a miracle that took place over a period of nine months. Through this procedure, this process of pregnancy by the mingling of the divine essence and the human essence, Christ was working to bring God into man. Therefore, through Christ&#8217;s work in His incarnation the God who had been outside of mankind was brought into humanity.<h2 class=head2>2. Making God One with Man</h2><p>Through Christ&#8217;s work in His incarnation not only was God brought into man, but God was also made one with man. Christ has accomplished the great work of making God one with man, of making the two-God and man-one person with two natures, divinity and humanity. How this was accomplished we cannot explain. Nevertheless, the Bible reveals clearly that through Christ&#8217;s incarnation God in His divinity was made one with man in humanity. The two essences of divinity and humanity were made into a single entity without a third essence being produced. In this one entity the two essences of divinity and humanity are the original essences. Even after being mingled in the person of the God-man, they are distinct; there is no mixture. God is still God, and man is still man, yet they have become one person, Christ, the God-man, in whom God is one with man. No one can explain this adequately.<p>Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence and born of a human virgin with a human essence. We use the word &#8220;essence&#8221; in a strong sense to denote something even more intrinsic than nature. The essence is the intrinsic constituent of a certain substance. Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit not only with the divine nature but with the divine essence. Therefore, He has two essences, the divine and the human. These two essences were not merely added together; they were mingled together. In the conception of Christ the divine essence and the human essence were mingled.<p>It is crucial that we have the proper understanding of the word &#8220;mingle&#8221; with respect to Christ&#8217;s work of bringing God into man and of making God one with man through His incarnation. We definitely do not use this word to mean that the mingling of divinity with humanity in Christ caused a third nature to be produced, something that is neither divine nor human. To say that with respect to the Lord Jesus the mingling of the divine essence and the human essence produced a third nature, a nature that is neither fully human nor divine, is heretical. We agree with the first definition of mingle given in Webster&#8217;s unabridged dictionary: &#8220;to combine or join (one thing with another, or two or more things together), especially so that the original elements are distinguishable in the combination.&#8221; Hence, to mingle is to combine two or more things together so that the original elements remain distinguishable.<p>This certainly is the situation regarding Christ as the God-man. Because He was conceived of the divine essence and the human essence, He is the mingling of God and man. But both the divine essence and the human essence remain and are distinguishable. These essences are mingled in Him without producing a third nature. In His one person Christ possesses two essences, and in Him each essence is distinguishable. Therefore, it is altogether accurate to say that the incarnation of Christ was the mingling of God with man. This mingling produced a single person, a divine-human person, the person of the God-man. Although Christ has two essences, He does not have two persons.<p>The conception of the God-man was God&#8217;s incarnation, constituted not only by the divine power but also of the divine essence mingled with the human essence to produce the God-man. Through this great work accomplished by Christ, God was made one with man so that He might be manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16).<p>The Trinity is a great mystery. The incarnation is also a great mystery. All genuine Christians, all who hold to the common faith (Titus 1:4), must believe in the Triune God and in Christ&#8217;s incarnation. Christ is God made one with man. Although He has both divinity and humanity, He is not two persons. Christ is one person with two essences. Although we cannot explain this adequately, we can enjoy Him as the God-man. In incarnation Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, accomplished the great work of bringing God into man and of making God one with man.<h2 class=head2>3. Putting Man in the Flesh upon Himself</h2><p>In His incarnation Christ put man in the flesh upon Himself. This man in the flesh may be likened to a garment. Christ put on this &#8220;garment&#8221; and wore it. Therefore, while He was living and walking on earth, inwardly He was God, and outwardly He was a man in the flesh, for He wore this man as a garment.<p>Concerning Christ&#8217;s putting on man in the flesh upon Himself, Hebrews 2:14a says, &#8220;Since therefore the children have partaken of blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner shared in the same.&#8221; This clearly indicates that Christ became a man in order to partake of blood and flesh. We do not have a Savior who is different in nature from us. No, Christ became exactly the same as we are, except for sin. Christ came in the flesh to be one with us, partaking of blood and flesh.<p>Christ&#8217;s incarnation means that the very God has become flesh. According to John 1:14, the Word, which is God, became flesh. Why did He become flesh? He became flesh so that He might be the same as we are. We are men of blood and flesh, and Christ partook of the same. Therefore, through incarnation He came as a man to our level. Although Christ is God, He came to our level and shared in our nature.<p>First John 4:2 says, &#8220;In this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is out of God.&#8221; Here &#8220;spirit&#8221; denotes the spirit of a genuine prophet motivated by the Holy Spirit of truth, which confesses the divine conception of Jesus, affirming that He was born as the Son of God. Every such spirit is surely out of God.<p>Jesus was conceived of the Spirit (Matt. 1:18). To confess Jesus coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God (Luke 1:31-35). Because He was conceived of the Spirit to be born in the flesh, the Spirit would never deny that He has come in the flesh through divine conception. Truly, through His work in incarnation Christ became a man in the flesh, putting man in the flesh upon Himself.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall go on to see Christ&#8217;s work in His human living.<h2 class=head1>C. IN HIS HUMAN LIVING</h2><p>Through His incarnation Christ became a man living on earth. The time required for Christ to become a man was much longer than that required for Him to create the universe, and the time of His work in His human living was far greater than the time of His work in becoming a man, thirty years compared to nine months. For thirty years the Lord Jesus was working in His human living. We may wonder why He, the Creator, the eternal God, spent such a long period of time simply living on earth. According to the record of the New Testament, we do not see much of what the Lord did during those years. It may seem to us that He only lived and that He did not do any work at all. However, the human living of the Lord Jesus was His work.<p>With Christ in His human living, there was no difference between life and work. His life was His work, and His work was His life. We may say that the Lord Jesus lived His work; He lived His ministry. With Him there was just one thing-His life, which was His work, His ministry. Whatever He did, whatever He spoke, and wherever He went were all a part of His life and work. He was continually living and working. For this reason, we cannot say how much the Lord Jesus worked. He worked everywhere and all the time because His work was His life, His life was His move, and His move was His work. With the Lord Jesus every aspect of His life was the same. With Him there was no distinction between life and work.<p>Just as Christ&#8217;s life was His work, so our living as Christians should be our working. This means that we need a living that matches our ministry for the Lord, a living that is the ground and support of our service for Him. Because we need such a living, it takes many years before one who desires to serve the Lord can be truly useful to Him in His ministry.<h2 class=head2>1. Being Found in Fashion as a Man, Even in the Form of a Slave</h2><p>In His human living Christ was found in fashion as a man, even in the form of a slave. Paul says that He &#8220;emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross&#8221; (Phil. 2:7-8). The likeness of men denotes the outward appearance of His humanity. He appeared outwardly to men as a man, but inwardly He had the reality of deity. Furthermore, when Christ became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in fashion as a man by men. The word &#8220;fashion&#8221; signifies the outward guise, the semblance. What Christ looked like in His humanity was found by men to be in fashion as a man.<p>Philippians 2:7 says that Christ even took the form of a slave. In His incarnation the Lord Jesus did not alter His divine nature but only His outward expression of the form of God (Phil. 2:6) to that of a slave. This was not a change of essence but of state.<p>Although Christ was God in the form of God, He was seen by others as being in fashion as a man. Before His incarnation He was, of course, not in fashion as a man. He was only in the form of God. But after He became a man it was necessary for Him to live and work in such a way as to build up the fashion of man in order to be found by others in fashion as a man. It took the Lord Jesus thirty years to build up such a fashion of man in His human living. Therefore, this should be considered part of His work in His human living.<p>While the Lord Jesus was living in His humanity on earth, He was working to build up the fashion of man. The Lord did not simply behave like a man for a short period of time. He became a man and then lived a human life for thirty years, living in the poor and lowly home of a carpenter. As He lived there, He built up the fashion of man and was found in fashion as a man. The Lord, therefore, carried out the great work of building up a human fashion. This is what He was doing during the first thirty years of His human life.<p>When Paul wrote about Christ&#8217;s human living in Philippians 2, he was very careful. He no doubt considered how to compose this part of the Epistle to the Philippians. Paul surely selected the right words, telling us that Christ was found in fashion as a man and that He took the form of a slave. Christ did not work to build up the fashion of a highly exalted man or of a man with a high rank. On the contrary, He worked to build up the fashion of a man who was a slave. It was not an easy thing that the Lord Jesus built up a fashion of a man in such a low state. This was a very fine work, and it took Him thirty years to accomplish it in full. After He finished this work, He came forth to begin His ministry. His ministry was based upon His work of building up in Himself the fashion of a man.<p>It is crucial for us to see that Christ&#8217;s work in His human living to build up the fashion of a man and to take on the form of a slave was the foundation and background of His ministry. Those who aspire to serve the Lord need to have a work not by doing but by living. This is a work carried out by one&#8217;s daily living. Those who wish to serve the Lord need to live to build up a work that will be the solid ground and strong background for their coming service to the Lord.<h2 class=head2>2. Doing Carpentry</h2><p>Mark 6:3 tells us that Christ was a carpenter in a lowly home. Carpentry is not a magnificent work, but it needs much of fineness and patience. In such a work Christ was found in fashion as a man, not in loftiness but in lowliness, fineness, and patience.<h2 class=head2>3. Declaring God</h2><p>Another aspect of Christ&#8217;s work in His human living was to declare God. &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&#8221; (John 1:18). In His human living Christ declared God. According to John 1:1-18, Christ declared God by the Word (vv. 1, 14), life (v. 4), light (vv. 4-5), grace (vv. 14, 16, 17), and reality (vv. 14, 17). The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized. God is declared in the Son through these five things. Although no one has ever seen God, Christ in His human living has declared God in the way of being the Word, life, light, grace, and reality. The more we receive the Word, have the divine life, and let the light of life shine within us, and the more we enjoy God as grace and apprehend Him as reality, the more He is declared to us. In His human living Christ carried out the work of declaring God in this way. During the thirty years of His living and working as a carpenter, Christ declared God. While He was living to build up the fashion of a man, He declared God to His mother, brothers, and sisters. They must have realized that there was something excellent and extraordinary with Him, something higher than the expression only of humanity. What they saw in the human living of the Lord Jesus was the declaration of God in Him. His human living declared God.<p>If you want to serve the Lord, you should not begin by trying to do a great work for the Lord. This is contrary to the divine principle. You should simply live a life that declares God. Then others will see in you something excellent, something divine. This indicates that in your daily living there is a work that declares God.<p>As we read the New Testament, we may wonder what the Lord Jesus was doing day after day for thirty years. In a sense, He was not doing anything. He was just living, and that living was His unique work to build up a fashion of a genuine man. Because the Lord Jesus was built up in this way, when He came out to minister, He did not need to pretend or to perform. There was no need for Him to deliberately try to behave like a God-man, a man with God in Him, for He was a genuine man and was found in fashion as a man. As a real man, He spontaneously declared God. Before the three and a half years of His ministry, He accomplished a preparatory work for thirty years. Therefore, with the Lord Jesus, thirty years were for the work of preparation. Afterward, the Lord Jesus was used by God in His ministry for only three and a half years.<h2 class=head2>4. Expressing the Father</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s work in His human living also includes His expressing the Father (John 14:9). According to the Gospel of John, Christ the Son came in the Father&#8217;s name (5:43), worked in the Father&#8217;s name (10:25), did the Father&#8217;s will (6:38), spoke the Father&#8217;s word (3:34a; 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:47-50), and sought the Father&#8217;s glory (7:18). He was one with the Father (10:30). He had no work, no will, no word, no glory, and no ambition for Himself. As such a one, Christ expressed only the Father. He did not express Himself. He was the Son, yet He expressed the Father.<p>Because the Son expresses not Himself but the Father, the Son&#8217;s expression is the Father&#8217;s expression. Therefore, when we see the Son, we see the Father. This is proved by the exchange between the Lord Jesus and Philip in John 14. In verse 7 the Lord pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known His Father also. Then He said, &#8220;Henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.&#8221; However, Philip replied, &#8220;Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us&#8221; (v. 8). To this the Lord Jesus answered, &#8220;He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father?&#8221; (v. 9). In the Son the Father is expressed and seen, for the Son is the expression of the Father. If we have seen the Son, we have seen the Father because the Father is embodied in the Son to be expressed through Him in His human living.<p>This was true of the Lord Jesus even at the age of twelve. When the Lord was twelve, He was a human child. But as we read the account in Luke 2, we see that in this child there was the divine element. God&#8217;s attributes were expressed in Christ&#8217;s human living. The Lord Jesus lived a genuine human life, yet in His human life we see the divine element and also certain divine factors. This life did not express man; it expressed God the Father.<h2 class=head2>5. Caring for the Things of the Father</h2><p>In His human living the Lord Jesus cared for the things of the Father. Luke 2:41-51 reveals that at the age of twelve He cared for God&#8217;s interests. Verse 42 says, &#8220;When He became twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the feast.&#8221; At the age of twelve, a boy was called by the Jews &#8220;son of the law,&#8221; and first incurred legal obligation (Alford). The number twelve also signifies eternal perfection in God&#8217;s administration. Hence, &#8220;twelve years old&#8221; indicates that what the Lord Jesus did here was perfectly related to God&#8217;s administration.<p>According to verses 43 through 48, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and His parents did not know it. When they realized that He was not with them in the caravan, they returned to Jerusalem searching for Him. When they found Him, His mother said to Him, &#8220;Child, why did You treat us like this? Behold, Your father and I are greatly distressed seeking You&#8221; (v. 48). The Lord replied, &#8220;Why is it that you were seeking Me? Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?&#8221; (v. 49). This indicates that the boy Jesus was caring for the interests of God. The words &#8220;My Father&#8221; in verse 49 point to the deity of Jesus (John 5:18). In His humanity He was the son of His parents; in His deity He was the Son of God the Father. Here we see the Lord&#8217;s dual status, His status as the Son of God and the Son of Man. In His humanity Christ, the Son of God and the Son of Man, cared for the things of the Father, for God&#8217;s interests.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>In this message we shall begin to cover the many aspects of Christ&#8217;s work in His earthly ministry.<h2 class=head1>D. IN HIS EARTHLY MINISTRY </h2><h2 class=head2>1. Preaching the Gospel</h2><p>In His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus preached the gospel, the good news. Luke 4:18a says, &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to bring good news to the poor.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;bring good news&#8221; is euaggelizo, which means to evangelize, to announce good news. To preach the gospel was the first commission of the Lord Jesus as God&#8217;s anointed One, the Messiah. The good news was to be preached to the poor, that is, to the poor in heavenly, spiritual, and divine things (Luke 12:21; Rev. 3:17; cf. Matt. 5:3).<p>Mark 1:14 says, &#8220;Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.&#8221; Christ&#8217;s preaching was to announce God&#8217;s glad tidings to the miserable people in bondage. His teaching (Mark 1:21-22) was to enlighten the ignorant ones in darkness with the divine light of truth. His preaching implied teaching, and His teaching implied preaching (Matt. 4:23). This is the first thing He did in His ministry, and it was the all-embracing structure of His evangelical service (Mark 1:38-39; 3:14; 6:12; 14:9; 16:15, 20).<p>In His preaching the Lord Jesus told people to &#8220;repent and believe in the gospel!&#8221; (Mark 1:15). To repent is mainly in the mind; to believe is mainly in the heart (Rom. 10:9). As used in Mark 1:15, the word &#8220;repent&#8221; literally means to think differently afterward, that is, to have a change of mind. To repent is to have a change of mind with regret for the past and a turn for the future. To believe in something is to believe into the thing which we believe. It is also to receive the things which we believe into us. To believe in the gospel is mainly to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ (Acts 16:31), and to believe in Him is to believe into Him (John 3:15-16) and receive Him into us (John 1:12) so that we may be organically united with Him. Such a faith in Christ (Gal. 3:22) is given to us by God (Eph. 2:8) through our hearing the word of the truth of the gospel (Rom. 10:17; Eph. 1:13). This faith brings us into all the blessings of the gospel (Gal. 3:14). Hence, it is precious to us (2 Pet. 1:1).<p>To believe is to receive the Lord Jesus not only for forgiveness of sins (Acts 10:43) but also for regeneration (1 Pet. 1:21, 23), that those who believe may become the children of God (John 1:12-13) and the members of Christ (Eph. 5:30) in an organic union with the Triune God (Matt. 28:19).<p>Specifically, in Mark 1:15 the Lord Jesus preached that we should believe in the gospel. This is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God (Mark 1:1), the gospel of God, and the gospel of the kingdom of God. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, with all the processes through which He has passed, including incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and all the redemptive work He accomplished, is the contents of the gospel (Rom. 1:2-4; Luke 2:10-11; 1 Cor. 15:1-4; 2 Tim. 2:8). Hence, the gospel is of Him. The gospel was planned, promised, and accomplished by God (Eph. 1:8-9; Acts 2:23; Rom. 1:2; 2 Cor. 5:21; Acts 3:15), and it is the power of God unto salvation to all believers (Rom. 1:16), that they may be reconciled to God (2 Cor. 5:19) and regenerated by Him (1 Pet. 1:3) to be His children (Rom. 8:16) and enjoy all His riches and blessings as their inheritance (Eph. 1:14). Hence, it is the gospel of God. It brings the believers into the realm of the divine ruling that they may participate in the blessings of the divine life in the divine kingdom (1 Thes. 2:12). Hence, it is also the gospel of the kingdom of God. Therefore, its full contents are the same as that of the New Testament with all its bequests. When we believe in this gospel, we inherit the Triune God with His redemption, His salvation, and His divine life with its riches for our eternal portion.<h2 class=head2>2. Doing Good</h2><p>Acts 10:38 says, &#8220;Jesus, the One from Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and power, who went about doing good and healing all those who were oppressed by the Devil, for God was with Him.&#8221; &#8220;Doing good&#8221; must refer to the miracles, especially healings, the Lord Jesus did for people. Christ, as God incarnated to be a man, did many miracles, as a beneficent work in His earthly ministry to release people from their sufferings of diseases and the possession of demons. This work, which He did in His humanity with the divine power, is to rescue people and set them free from the oppression of the Devil and to express God in His humanity.<h2 class=head2>3. Doing Miracles</h2><p>In His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus did miracles. He cleansed lepers, healed the sick, raised the dead, and cast out demons.<h2 class=head3>a. Cleansing Lepers</h2><p>Matthew 8:2 says, &#8220;Behold, a leper approached and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me.&#8221; A leper portrays a typical sinner. Leprosy is the most contaminating and damaging disease, isolating its victim from both God and from men. According to the law, a leper should be excluded from the people because of His uncleanness. No one could touch him (Lev. 13:45-46). According to the scriptural examples, leprosy comes from rebellion and disobedience. Miriam became leprous because of her rebellion against God&#8217;s deputy authority (Num. 12:1-10). Naaman was cleansed because of his obedience (2 Kings 5:1, 9-14). All fallen human beings have become leprous in the sight of God because of their rebellion. Because leprosy isolated its victim from both God and man, to cleanse a leper signifies to recover the sinner to fellowship with God and with men.<p>Matthew 8:3 continues, &#8220;Stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.&#8221; Although no one was allowed to touch a leper, Christ touched him. What mercy and sympathy! By His one touch, &#8220;immediately his leprosy was cleansed.&#8221; What wonderful cleansing! Leprosy not only requires healing as do other diseases; it also requires cleansing like sin (1 John 1:7), because of its filthy and contaminating nature.<p>Luke 17:11-14 tells how the Lord Jesus cleansed ten lepers in Samaria. &#8220;As He entered into a certain village, there met Him ten leprous men, who stood at a distance; and they raised their voice, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!&#8221; (vv. 12-13). We know from Luke 10 that while the Lord was on the way through Samaria, He was rejected in Samaria. He must have realized that the majority of the ten lepers were Samaritans. Nevertheless, as soon as the ten appealed to Him for mercy, He healed them all without preference. &#8220;Seeing them, He said to them, Go and show yourselves to the priests. And it came about as they were going away, they were cleansed&#8221; (v. 14).<h2 class=head3>b. Healing the Sick</h2><p>Matthew 15:30 says, &#8220;Great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, the crippled, the blind, the dumb, and many others, and they cast them at His feet; and He healed them.&#8221; In Matthew 8:14 and 15 we have the specific case of the healing of Peter&#8217;s mother-in-law: &#8220;When Jesus had come into Peter&#8217;s house, He saw his mother-in-law laid aside and in a fever; and He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and ministered to Him.&#8221; Sickness is an issue of sin and a sign of man&#8217;s abnormal condition before God because of sin. Therefore, in His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus healed people of their sick condition both physically and spiritually and restored them to normal so that they might serve Him. Many cases are recorded in the Gospels to illustrate such healing (Matt. 8:13; Mark 5:25-34).<h2 class=head3>c. Raising the Dead</h2><p>On certain occasions the Lord performed the great miracle of raising the dead. In Luke 7:11-17 we have the case of the Lord&#8217;s raising up the dead son of a widow in the city of Nain. &#8220;As He came near the gate of the city, behold, one who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a considerable crowd from the city was with her. And seeing her, the Lord had compassion on her, and said to her, Do not weep&#8221; (vv. 12-13). This case was unique in its misery-the only son of a widow was being carried in the coffin. The Lord&#8217;s compassion was also unique in His loving sympathy. He volunteered, in His tender mercy, His power of resurrection to raise the widow&#8217;s son from death, without being asked to do so. &#8220;He touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, arise! And the dead man sat up and began to speak; and He gave him to his mother&#8221; (vv. 14-15). In His raising up the dead son and giving him to his mother, we see the expression of Christ&#8217;s divine attributes in His human virtues.<p>Another case of Christ&#8217;s raising the dead is that of Lazarus in John 11. In verse 25 the Lord said to Martha, &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, even if he should die, shall live.&#8221; Here the Lord Jesus spoke in the present tense, saying, &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life.&#8221; The words &#8220;I am&#8221; indicate that He is Jehovah, the great I Am, the One with whom there is no time element. Because Christ is resurrection, whenever He is present, resurrection is there. The Lord proceeded to demonstrate this fact by raising up Lazarus: &#8220;He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth! And he who died came out&#8221; (vv. 43-44). When Lazarus heard the voice of the living Lord, he was quickened and was raised from the dead. This case of resurrection indicates that the Lord Jesus is not merely a healing Savior but a life-giving Savior. He wants not only to heal us but to give us life, to resurrect us.<h2 class=head3>d. Casting Out Demons</h2><p>The Lord Jesus also cast out demons (Matt. 8:16). In Mark 1:23-28 we have a case of the casting out of demons. A man with an unclean spirit cried out, and the Lord Jesus rebuked him saying, &#8220;Be quiet, and come out of him!&#8221; (vv. 23-25). This unclean spirit was not a fallen angel; this spirit was a demon (vv. 32, 34, 39; Luke 4:33), one of the spirits of the living creatures who lived in the preadamic age and were judged by God when they joined Satan&#8217;s rebellion (see Life-study of Genesis, Message Two). The fallen angels work with Satan in the air (Eph. 2:2; 6:11-12), and these demons, the unclean spirits, move with him on the earth. Both act evilly upon man for the kingdom of Satan. The possession of people by demons signifies Satan&#8217;s usurpation of man, whom God created for His purpose. The Lord Jesus came to destroy the works of Satan (1 John 3:8), and in His earthly ministry He cast out demons from the possessed people (Mark 1:34, 39; 3:15; 6:7, 13; 16:17) so that they might be delivered from Satan&#8217;s bondage (Luke 13:16), out of Satan&#8217;s authority of darkness (Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13), into God&#8217;s kingdom (Mark 1:15).<p>In Matthew 12:28 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you.&#8221; The Spirit of God is the power of the kingdom of God. Where the Spirit of God is in power, there the kingdom of God is, and there the demons have no ground. By the Lord&#8217;s word here we see that the battle fought for the kingdom is not fought by man alone but by a man with the Spirit of God. Therefore, the Lord Jesus said that He cast out demons by the Spirit of God and that this is the coming of the kingdom of God.<h2 class=head2>4. Doing Signs</h2><p>In His ministry on earth the Lord Jesus did signs, many of which are recorded in the Gospel of John (John 20:30). A sign is a symbol with a particular significance. The Gospel of John is a book of signs, not of miracles. In Matthew, Mark, and Luke we read of miracles, but in the Gospel of John the word &#8220;miracle&#8221; is not used. Instead this Gospel speaks of signs. For example, the changing of water into wine (John 2:7-11) is called a sign (v. 11). Another sign in this Gospel is the feeding of the five thousand with five barley loaves and two fishes (John 6:9-14).<h2 class=head3>a. Changing Water into Wine</h2><p>While the Lord Jesus was at a wedding feast in Cana (John 2:1-2), the wine ran out (v. 3). A wedding feast signifies the pleasure and enjoyment of human life, and wine, the life juice of the grape, signifies life. Because wine, unlike water, derives its source from grapes, it comes from something living. Wine signifies life, for the wine of the grapes is the life of the grapes. Thus, the enjoyment of man depends on the life of man. When the life is brought to an end, all enjoyment is gone. Hence, the wine running out symbolizes the human life running out. When the wine, the center of the enjoyment of the wedding feast, runs out, the pleasure of the wedding feast is gone. This signifies not only that the enjoyment of life is over, but also that human life is finished. When our human life is ended, all our enjoyment is also gone.<p>After the wine ran out, Christ changed water into wine (vv. 6-9). Here water signifies death, as in Genesis 1:2, 6; Exodus 14:21; and Matthew 3:16. The Lord Jesus marvelously changed this death water into wine. Since the water signifies death and the wine signifies life, Christ&#8217;s changing water into wine signifies that He changes death into life. When in our experience the Lord Jesus changes our water into wine, our death into life, the wine in our &#8220;wedding feast&#8221; will never end. Because we have been regenerated, life with its spiritual enjoyment will last forever. We shall have an eternal wedding feast, a feast not in our natural life but in the new life, the divine life, received through regeneration.<p>It is significant that the changing of water into wine is called &#8220;the beginning of signs&#8221; (John 2:11). The first mention of anything in the Scriptures sets forth the principle of that thing. Therefore, the first sign here sets forth the principle of all the following signs (John 3:2; 4:54; 6:2, 14, 26, 30; 7:31; 9:16; 10:41; 11:47; 12:18, 37), that is, to change death into life. The Lord&#8217;s changing water into wine establishes the principle of life-changing death into life.<h2 class=head3>b. Feeding Five Thousand Men with Five Barley Loaves and Two Fishes</h2><p>In John 6:9-14 we have the sign of Christ&#8217;s feeding five thousand men with five barley loaves and two fishes. In The All-Inclusive Christ we point out that the significance of barley is different from that of wheat (John 12:24). Wheat signifies the incarnated Christ, and barley signifies the resurrected Christ. The Lord told His people in Leviticus 23 to offer the firstfruits of their harvest each year. In the land of Palestine barley ripens earlier than any other crop and is the first of the harvest. Hence, it typifies the resurrected Christ (Lev. 23:10), who is our life supply. Therefore, the barley loaves signify Christ in resurrection as food to us. The number five, composed of four, representing the creatures (Rev. 4:6), and one, representing the Creator (1 Cor. 8:6), signifies responsibility. This indicates that five barley loaves signify the resurrected Christ, who is able to bear responsibility.<p>Barley, of course, is of the plant life. In typology, the plant life is for generating, for producing. The two fishes are of the animal life and signify the redeeming aspect of Christ&#8217;s life. The number two means testimony (Rev. 11:3). The two fishes are a testimony that Christ is sufficient to bear responsibility in feeding us.<p>The barley loaves of the plant life signify the generating aspect of Christ&#8217;s life, and the fishes signify the redeeming aspect of His life. As the generating life, Christ grew on the land, on the God-created earth. As the redeeming life, He lived in the sea, the Satan-corrupted world. In order to regenerate us He grew on the God-created earth for producing life, but in order to redeem us He lived in the satanic and sinful world. Just as fish can live in salty water without being salty, so Christ could live in the sinful world without being sinful and without being affected by the world. In His redeeming life, as typified by the two fishes, Christ lived a victorious life in the &#8220;death waters&#8221; of the sinful world. It is significant, therefore, that He fed the people with barley loaves and fishes. This indicates that He fed them with the generating life and the redeeming life, the life that overcomes death.<p>We need Christ as both our regenerating life and our redeeming life. When He died on the cross, blood and water came out of His side (John 19:34). The blood is to redeem us, and the water is to generate us. Christ&#8217;s shed blood accomplished redemption for us, and the water from His wounded side imparted His life to us. Now we can understand why the five barley loaves were accompanied by the two fishes, which signify the animal life for redemption. The Lord is signified by both the barley loaves and the fishes, for He is the plant life to generate us and the animal life to redeem us. Eventually, the feeding with Christ&#8217;s resurrection life results in eternal life. This is the reason He said, &#8220;Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides to eternal life, which the Son of Man shall give you&#8221; (John 6:27). The significance of this sign in John 6 is that we need to feed on Christ as our life and life supply.<h2 class=head2>5. Serving People</h2><p>Matthew 20:28a indicates that in His earthly ministry Christ served people: &#8220;The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve.&#8221; He, of course, served God. He served people by doing such things as healing them and feeding them. For example, His feeding the five thousand in John 6 was a great service rendered to them. The Lord Jesus also served the disciples when He washed their feet (John 13:1-38).<p>The Gospel of Mark emphasizes Christ&#8217;s serving in His earthly ministry. Mark&#8217;s intention is to impress us with the Lord&#8217;s excellent deeds in His gospel service, providing more detail than the other Gospels in order to portray Christ&#8217;s diligence, faithfulness, and other virtues in the saving service He rendered to sinners for God. While Christ&#8217;s diligence in labor, His need of food and rest (Mark 3:20-21; 6:31), His anger (3:5), His groaning (7:34), and His affection (10:21) display beautifully His humanity in its virtue and perfection, His lordship (2:28), His omniscience (2:8), His miraculous power, His authority to cast out demons (1:27; 3:15), to forgive sins (2:7, 10), and to silence the wind and the sea (4:39) manifest in full His deity, even as He served people. Such a One served sinners as their Savior, with His life as their ransom (10:45), for the fulfillment of the eternal purpose of God.<h2 class=head2>6. Seeking and Saving the Lost, the Sinners</h2><p>In Luke 19:1-10 we have the case of Christ&#8217;s seeking and saving Zaccheus, a lost sinner. Zaccheus, a chief tax collector, was an isolated person. He was despised by the Jewish community and was even more isolated than a leper. Nevertheless, in front of a large crowd the Lord Jesus said to him, &#8220;Today I must stay in your house&#8221; (v. 5). Although the Lord did not say much to Zaccheus, Zaccheus responded in a very strong way, recognizing Him as his Lord: &#8220;Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much&#8221; (v. 8). This was the spontaneous issue of the dynamic power of the Lord&#8217;s salvation. This salvation is actually the Lord Himself. In verse 5 He says, &#8220;I must stay in your house,&#8221; but in verse 9 He says, &#8220;Salvation has come to this house.&#8221; The &#8220;I&#8221; in verse 5 equals &#8220;salvation&#8221; in verse 9, indicating that salvation is actually Christ Himself. When He comes, salvation comes.<p>In Luke 19:10 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.&#8221; Here we see that Zaccheus was not only a sinner but also that he was lost. The Savior came to Jericho purposely to seek and to save such a lost one. The Lord stayed in Zaccheus&#8217; house in order to save this lost sinner.<p>In 1 Timothy 1:15 Paul declares, &#8220;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.&#8221; Christ came into the world to be our Savior by incarnation (John 1:14). He was God incarnated to be a man so that He may save us through His death and resurrection in His human body. This should be constantly announced as the gospel, the glad tidings, in the local churches.<h2 class=head2>7. Shining upon the People in Darkness and the Shadow of Death</h2><p>Another aspect of Christ&#8217;s earthly ministry was His shining upon the people in darkness and the shadow of death. At the beginning of His ministry He went to Galilee of the nations. Matthew 4:16 says, &#8220;The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death, to them light sprang up.&#8221; Here we see that Christ&#8217;s ministry did not begin with earthly power but with heavenly light. This light was actually Christ Himself as the light of life (John 8:12) shining in the shadow of death.<p>When the Lord began His ministry as light, He made no display of power or authority. Rather, He walked on the seashore as a common person. But when He contacted people by the Sea of Galilee, He shined upon them like a great light shining in the darkness and in a region and shadow of death. At His birth He was a little star, but in His ministry He became a great light. As such a great light, He went to Galilee to shine upon the people in darkness and in the shadow of death.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of Christ&#8217;s work in His earthly ministry.<h2 class=head2>8. Calling Disciples</h2><p>In His ministry Christ called disciples. It was not easy for the Lord Jesus to call out others to follow Him, but in His ministry He did such a work.<p>Matthew 4:18-22 describes Christ&#8217;s work in calling disciples. Verse 18 says, &#8220;Walking beside the sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.&#8221; Here we see that Christ&#8217;s ministry began not in Jerusalem but by the seashore and consisted of catching men who were not so religious, who lived around the sea instead of in the holy place, and making them fishers of men.<p>Verses 19 and 20 continue, &#8220;He said to them, Come, follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men. And immediately, leaving the nets, they followed Him.&#8221; Andrew, a disciple of John the Baptist, had brought Peter to the Lord, in the place where John preached, prior to this (John 1:35-36, 40-42). That was the first time they met the Lord. When He met them the second time, at the Sea of Galilee, they were attracted by Him as the great light in the darkness of death (Matt. 4:16) and followed Him in the light of life (John 8:12).<p>When Peter and Andrew were called by the Lord Jesus, they were casting a net into the sea. The Lord called them to follow Him and promised to make them fishers of men. They left the net and followed the Lord Jesus to become fishers of men. Eventually, Peter became the first great fisher on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:37-42; 4:4).<p>When James and John were called by the Lord Jesus, they were mending their nets in the boat (Matt. 4:21-22). The Lord called them, and they left the boat and their father and followed Him. John and his brother, like Peter and Andrew, were attracted by the Lord Jesus and followed Him. Eventually, John became a real mender, mending the breakages in the church by his ministry of life.<p>Christ&#8217;s calling of these four disciples was the foundation for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens. These four disciples became the first four of the twelve apostles. Peter and Andrew were the first pair, and James and John were the second. Thus, the first four disciples caught by the Lord Jesus became the first four foundation stones of the kingdom of God, which are four of the twelve foundations of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:14).<h2 class=head2>9. Leading His Sheep out of the Jewish Fold-Judaism</h2><p>In His earthly ministry Christ led His sheep out of the Jewish fold, out of Judaism (John 10:2-5, 7, 9). The sheep in John 10 are God&#8217;s chosen people. The sheepfold is the law, or Judaism as the religion of the law, in which God&#8217;s chosen people were kept and guarded in custody and ward until Christ came. In eternity past God with His foresight had chosen His people. In time, before Christ came, God put His chosen people into the custody of the law. After Christ came, He wanted all of His people to come out of the law&#8217;s custody. However, the Jewish religion had utilized the law to form Judaism. Hence, Judaism had become the sheepfold.<p>In John 10:7 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.&#8221; Then in verse 9 He continues, &#8220;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.&#8221; Christ is the door to the sheepfold. As the door, He is both the entrance and the exit of the sheepfold. First, the Old Testament saints went into the fold, which was the law, through Christ as the door. The fold of the law, which eventually became Judaism, confined all of His chosen people. Christ is the door through which the believers may now come out of Judaism and come into Him as the pasture. Therefore, in His ministry Christ called His own sheep by name and led them out of the fold and into the pasture (John 10:3). The pasture signifies Christ as the feeding place for the sheep. Now that Christ has come, the sheep, God&#8217;s chosen people, must come out of the sheepfold and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture. The reason the Lord Jesus did not leave the sheep in the sheepfold was that the age, the dispensation, had been changed. During the time of the Old Testament, it was right for the sheep to remain in the fold. But since Christ has come and the dispensation has changed, the sheep should no longer remain in the fold. For this reason, even though the Judaizers may have accused Christ of stealing the sheep, He accomplished the work of leading the sheep out of the fold of Judaism. He was condemned by the Judaizers for doing this work.<h2 class=head2>10. Imparting Eternal Life into His Sheep</h2><p>After leading His sheep out of the fold, the Lord Jesus imparted eternal life into them. He said, &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly&#8221; (John 10:10b). The Greek word for &#8220;life&#8221; here, zoe, is the word used in the New Testament for eternal, divine life. This is God&#8217;s life, the divine, infinite, uncreated, eternal life. This is the life Christ imparted into His sheep, and this is the life we receive by believing in Him. &#8220;He who believes in the Son has eternal life&#8221; (John 3:36).<p>In John 10:11 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.&#8221; Here the Greek word for life is psuche, the same word for soul, which signifies the soulish life, the human life. As a man the Lord Jesus has the human life, and as God, He has the divine life. He laid down His human life to accomplish redemption for His sheep so that they might share His divine life, the eternal life, by which they are formed into one flock under Himself as the one Shepherd.<p>Although the Lord&#8217;s sheep are God&#8217;s chosen ones, they are fallen persons in need of redemption. Therefore, the Lord Jesus sacrificed His human life in order to accomplish redemption for the sheep. In this way His sheep have been redeemed. Then the sheep receive eternal life, and by this life they live together as one flock. Thus, the flock is formed into one unit, one entity, by the eternal life Christ imparts into them. In the human life we are condemned and divided; in the divine life we are accepted and united and become one entity, one flock in one life. The flock is produced, kept, maintained, and formed by the divine life. Through Christ&#8217;s redemption, eternal life has been imparted into us to make us one flock.<p>In John 10:27 and 28a the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &#8220;My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever.&#8221; Eternal life is the uncreated life of God, which the Lord Jesus released through His death (John 12:24) and imparted into every one of His believers through His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). Since this is the eternal life that lasts forever, whoever possesses it will by no means perish forever, that is, for eternity.<h2 class=head2>11. Preaching the Kingdom</h2><p>Matthew 4:17 says, &#8220;From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.&#8221; Here Christ continued the preaching of His forerunner, John the Baptist (Matt. 3:2). John the Baptist was the first to preach repentance for the kingdom, and Christ was the second. It is marvelous that the Lord Jesus repeated and continued the preaching of John the Baptist. This shows the importance of the kingdom. If the preaching of the kingdom were not important, the Lord Jesus would not have repeated it. His repeating the preaching of John the Baptist proves that the preaching of the kingdom is very important.<p>In Mark 1:15a Christ declared, &#8220;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near.&#8221; The kingdom of God is the ruling, the reigning of God with all its blessing and enjoyment. To enter into this kingdom, people need to repent of their sins and believe in the gospel (Mark 1:15b) so that their sins may be forgiven and that they may be regenerated by God to have the divine life, which matches the divine nature of this kingdom (John 3:3, 5). All the believers in Christ can share the kingdom in the church age for their enjoyment of God in His righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (Rom. 14:17). This kingdom will become the kingdom of Christ and of God for the overcoming believers to inherit and enjoy in the coming kingdom age (1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5), that they may reign with Christ a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6). Then, as the eternal kingdom, it will be an eternal blessing of God&#8217;s eternal life for all God&#8217;s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (Rev. 21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14, 17). It was such a kingdom of God that, according to the Lord&#8217;s word, had drawn near.<p>According to Luke 4:43, in His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus brought the &#8220;good news of the kingdom of God.&#8221; The kingdom of God is Christ Himself (Luke 17:21) as the seed of life, sown into His believers, God&#8217;s chosen people (Mark 4:3, 26), and developing into a realm which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life. Its entrance is regeneration (John 3:5), and its development is in the believers&#8217; growth in the divine life (2 Pet. 1:3-11). The kingdom is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live, and it will develop into the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward to the overcoming saints in the millennium. Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God&#8217;s eternal life for all God&#8217;s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (Rev. 21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14). Such a kingdom, the kingdom of God, is what the Lord Jesus preached as the gospel, the good news.<h2 class=head2>12. Sending the Twelve Apostles and the Seventy Disciples to Preach the Kingdom</h2><p>In Luke 9 and 10 the Lord Jesus sent the twelve apostles and the seventy disciples to preach the kingdom. When He proclaimed the kingdom, He alone was carrying out the God-given ministry. After He began to preach the kingdom, He called certain ones to Himself. In Luke 6:13 the Lord Jesus called His disciples, and &#8220;He chose from among them twelve, whom He also named apostles.&#8221; These twelve apostles became &#8220;apprentices&#8221; following the Lord to learn how to carry out His ministry. Eventually, they were ready to share in the spreading of the kingdom. Prior to Luke 9:1 the ministry was carried out only by the Lord Himself. But here we have the spreading of the kingdom through the twelve apostles. No longer was there just one person proclaiming the kingdom. Now twelve others were sent out to preach the kingdom.<p>Luke 9:1 says, &#8220;Having called together the twelve, He gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to heal diseases.&#8221; The power and authority over demons and to heal diseases is for the release of the captives (Luke 4:18). As a result of the fall, man was captured by Satan, sin, and disease, which is the issue of sin. Every fallen human being is a captive both of demons and of diseases. Therefore, the Lord Jesus gave the twelve apostles power and authority over demons and diseases. This is the negative aspect of the jubilee (Luke 4:18-19), the aspect of the release of the captives. The authority over demons and disease is a foretaste of the power of the coming age (Heb. 6:5), that is, of the millennium, in which all demons will be cast out and all diseases will be healed (Isa. 35:5-6).<p>Luke 9:2 continues, &#8220;He sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to cure the sick.&#8221; Here we have the proclaiming of the kingdom of God as the positive aspect of the jubilee. The kingdom of God involves the recovery of the right to enjoy God in Christ. Therefore, to proclaim the kingdom of God is to proclaim the jubilee. In particular, it is to preach the positive aspect of the jubilee-the recovery of our lost right to the enjoyment of God in Christ.<p>In Luke 10:1 and 9 we see that later the Lord Jesus appointed seventy disciples to preach the kingdom. &#8220;The Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come&#8221; (v. 1). These seventy were to say to the people, &#8220;The kingdom of God has drawn near to you&#8221; (v. 9). The preaching of the kingdom through the twelve was in Galilee. But in Luke 10, on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem and through Samaria, the need was much greater. Therefore, the Lord Jesus appointed seventy and sent them to preach the kingdom. He appointed seventy disciples to share His ministry, even as Moses appointed seventy elders to share his burden as God charged him (Num. 11:16-17; Exo. 24:1, 9). The fact that He sent them out two by two indicates that they were sent out as witnesses (Deut. 17:6; 19:15; Matt. 18:16).<h2 class=head2>13. Sowing the Seed of the Kingdom</h2><p>Matthew 13 reveals that in His ministry Christ sowed the seed of the kingdom. In verse 3 He says, &#8220;Behold, the sower went out to sow.&#8221; In verse 24 He speaks of &#8220;a man sowing good seed in his field,&#8221; and this man is the Son of Man (v. 37). Although the Lord Jesus was often called a teacher, in His earthly ministry He was actually a sower. He came to sow the seed, and this seed is the word of the kingdom with Christ in it as life (v. 19). The seed is also the sons, the people, of the kingdom (v. 38). Hence, the seed sown by the Lord Jesus was Himself as life to make the believers the seed of the kingdom. Here three things are interrelated: the word of the kingdom, the sons of the kingdom, and Christ Himself as the life within the seed. The word of the kingdom actually is Christ Himself as the word of life. This seed eventually produces the sons of the kingdom who are the believers. Therefore, the seed refers to the word of the kingdom, to Christ Himself as life, and to us, the sons of the kingdom. By Christ&#8217;s being the living word of life sown into our being, we are made the sons of the kingdom.<p>In Matthew 13 we see that Christ establishes the kingdom by sowing Himself as the seed of life into believing people so that the kingdom may grow. This indicates that the establishment of the kingdom is absolutely a matter of growth in life. To establish the kingdom is to grow the kingdom. The kingdom is not established by outward working but by inward growing. If we do not see this, we may think that the church is built up by work and labor. The church, however, can be produced only by sowing Christ as the seed into humanity. This seed will grow within the believers and produce the church. Therefore, the kingdom is brought into being not by teaching or working but by sowing Christ as the living word of life into humanity. This seed will grow, and the life in it will produce the kingdom. The kingdom is a matter of life which has grown. The source of the kingdom is Christ as the seed of life. May we all be deeply impressed with the fact that the kingdom is wholly a matter of life. This means that the kingdom is Christ Himself as the seed of life sown into our being. The Sower is Christ, and the seed also is Christ, Christ in the word sown into us to make us sons of the kingdom.<p>In Mark 4 we have a further revelation of Christ&#8217;s work in sowing the seed of the kingdom. The sower in verse 3 is Christ, the Son of God, coming to sow Himself as the seed of life in His word (v. 14) into people&#8217;s hearts so that He may grow and live in them and be expressed from within them. This sowing was Christ&#8217;s preaching of the gospel that brought in the kingdom of God (Mark 1:14-15). It was, as in Mark 4:26, the sowing of the seed of life in the word spoken by the Lord Jesus. This indicates that His ministry was to sow the divine life into the people whom He served. The growth of this life depends upon the condition of the served ones, its issue differing according to their various conditions.<p>The Lord Jesus sowed the seed of the kingdom into the human heart. In Mark 4 and Matthew 13 the human heart is likened to soil. Our heart is the field, the soil, into which Christ has sown Himself as the seed of life. Therefore, the Lord Jesus is both the Sower and the seed sown. As the Sower, He sows Himself as the seed of life through His word.<p>In our reading of Matthew 13 and Mark 4 we need to be impressed with the fact that the kingdom of God is very different from the kingdom of man. The kingdom of man is a matter of organization. The kingdom of God is not a matter of organization but absolutely a matter of life. The kingdom of God is actually the God-man, Jesus Christ, sown as a seed into His believers. After this seed has been sown into them, it will grow in them and eventually develop into a kingdom. Jesus Christ, the seed of the kingdom of God, has been sown into those who believe in Him. Now this seed is growing and developing within the believers. Eventually, this growth and development will have an issue, and this issue will be the kingdom.<p>If we say that we are practicing the kingdom life, we need to realize that this kingdom is not an organization. No, this kingdom is a life which is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, who has been sown into us and is now growing within us.<p>In order to make this matter clear, we may borrow from biology the word &#8220;gene.&#8221; The Christ who has been sown into our being is the gene of the kingdom. We know that without human genes it is impossible to have human life. Our birth, being, and existence all came from a gene. Now we must see that Christ has been sown into us to be the gene of the kingdom. Eventually, the kingdom will issue from this gene. May we all see that the One who has been sown into our heart is the gene of the kingdom. Christ has been sown into us as a gene, as a seed of life, to grow, develop, and issue in the kingdom.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(5)</h1><p>In this message we shall pay attention to a particular aspect of Christ&#8217;s earthly ministry-His teaching the truths concerning certain crucial matters.<h2 class=head2>14. Teaching the Truths Mainly concerning:</h2><h2 class=head3>a. The Gospel and Salvation</h2><h2 class=head4>(1) The Forgiveness of Sins</h2><p>The Gospel of Luke records Christ&#8217;s teaching regarding the gospel and salvation. In Luke 7:41-48 we have His teaching about the forgiveness of sins. The Lord Jesus said to Simon the Pharisee, &#8220;A certain moneylender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. But having nothing to repay, he graciously forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him more?&#8221; (vv. 41-42). Simon answered, &#8220;I suppose the one whom he graciously forgave the more,&#8221; and the Lord replied, &#8220;You judged correctly&#8221; (v. 43). Then, referring to the woman who had been wetting His feet with her tears, wiping them with her hair, and anointing them with ointment, He said, &#8220;I say to you, her sins which are many have been forgiven, because she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, he loves little&#8221; (v. 47). In these verses the Lord Jesus indicates that sinners have nothing to repay their debt to God and that love to the Savior is the issue, not the cause, of the Savior&#8217;s forgiveness. The woman&#8217;s much love was a strong proof that her many sins had been forgiven.<p>Regarding the two debtors who were forgiven by the moneylender, the Lord asked, &#8220;Which of them therefore will love him more?&#8221; This indicates clearly that love is the issue of forgiveness. Concerning this, we need to pay attention to the word &#8220;therefore&#8221; in verse 42, a word which proves that love comes after forgiveness instead of preceding it. What, then, is the cause of the forgiveness of sins? The cause is faith (v. 50). The woman&#8217;s sins were forgiven not because of her love but because of her faith. Therefore, faith comes before forgiveness, and love follows faith.<p>It is very important for us to see that forgiveness comes before love. Love is not the cause of the forgiveness of sins; love is the issue, the outcome of our faith. When we believe in the Lord Jesus, our faith becomes the cause of His forgiveness of our sins. Then as a result of having our sins forgiven, we begin to love the Lord.<h2 class=head4>(2) The One Who Renders Full Salvation</h2><p>To a self-justified lawyer who asked what he could do to inherit eternal life, the Lord Jesus told the parable of the good Samaritan (10:30-37a). In this parable we see Christ as the One who can render us full salvation; we also see our need for this salvation.<p>All the points of the good Samaritan&#8217;s care for the dying one portrayed, in His humanity with His divinity, Christ&#8217;s merciful, tender, and bountiful care for a sinner condemned under law. This shows to the uttermost His high standard of morality in His saving grace. &#8220;Coming to him, he bound up his wounds, pouring on them oil and wine. And placing him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn and took care of him. And on the next morning, taking out two denarii, he gave them to the innkeeper and said to him, Take care of him; and whatever you spend in addition, when I return, I will repay you&#8221; (vv. 34-35). He bound up his wounds-healing him; he poured on his wounds oil and wine-giving him the Holy Spirit and the divine life (Matt. 9:17; John 2:9); he placed him on his own beast (donkey)-carrying him by lowly means in a lowly way (Zech. 9:9); he brought him to an inn-bringing him to the church; he took care of him-taking care of him through the church; he paid the inn for him-blessing the church for him; and whatever the inn spends he will repay at his return-whatever the church spends for him in this age will be repaid at the Savior&#8217;s coming back.<p>The self-justified lawyer thought that he could love another as his neighbor (v. 29), not knowing, under the blindness of self-justification, that he himself needed a neighbor, the Lord Jesus, to love him. Hence, the self-justified one was helped to know that he needed a loving neighbor (like the good Samaritan, who is a figure of the Savior) to love him, not a neighbor to be loved by him. The Savior intended to unveil to him through this story that he was condemned to death under the law, unable to take care of himself, needless to say to love others, and that the Lord Jesus was the One who would love him and render him full salvation.<h2 class=head4>(3) A Warning concerning Covetousness</h2><p>In His gospel message in Luke 12:15-21 the Lord Jesus gives a warning concerning covetousness. Someone in the crowd had asked Him to tell his brother to divide the inheritance with him (v. 13). To divide the inheritance is to pay attention to material things. The Lord said, &#8220;Take heed and guard yourself from all covetousness; for no one&#8217;s life is in the abundance of his possessions&#8221; (v. 15). Here the Lord indicates that we should pay attention not to material things but to life, to the soul, for one&#8217;s life does not consist in material things. Then He spoke a parable about a certain rich man whose land brought forth well, who decided to build larger barns (vv. 16-18), and who would say to his soul, &#8220;Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; take it easy, eat, drink, be merry&#8221; (v. 19). The rich man intended to rely on his material possessions so that he might rest, eat, drink, and be merry. He did not know that on that very night God would require his soul (v. 20). This was his foolishness. &#8220;So,&#8221; the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;is he who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God&#8221; (v. 21). The point here is that as those who would enjoy God&#8217;s salvation, we should not hold on to material possessions as an earthly treasure. Rather, we should lay up treasures for ourselves in the heavens.<h2 class=head4>(4) Accepting God&#8217;s Invitation</h2><p>In 14:16-24 we have Christ&#8217;s teaching about the acceptance of God&#8217;s invitation. &#8220;A certain man was making a great dinner and invited many; and he sent his slave at the dinner hour to say to those who had been invited, Come, for it is now ready&#8221; (vv. 16-17). This great dinner is for God&#8217;s full salvation. God, as the certain man, has prepared His full salvation as a great dinner and sent the first apostles as His slaves to invite the Jews. But because they were occupied by their riches, such as land, cattle, or a wife, they refused His invitation (vv. 18-20). Then God sent the apostles to invite the street people-the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame. Because of their poverty and misery, they accepted God&#8217;s invitation (vv. 21-22a). Yet God&#8217;s salvation still had room for more; therefore, He sent His slaves to go out further to the Gentile world, as the roads and hedges, to compel the Gentiles to come in and fill up the room of His salvation (vv. 22b-23; Acts 13:46-48; Rom. 11:25).<p>In this parable the Lord&#8217;s intention was to let the Pharisees know that God had invited them to His great feast, but they had rejected God&#8217;s invitation. This made it necessary for God to go to those of the lower class-to the poor, crippled, blind, and lame. After that, because there was still room in God&#8217;s salvation, God sent His slaves into the Gentile world to gather more people into His feast. Therefore, eventually those who had first been invited by God-the Pharisees, the scribes, and the lawyers-will not be able to enter into the kingdom of God.<p>This parable is an excellent parable concerning salvation. In order to be saved it is not necessary for us to do anything. We simply need to answer God&#8217;s invitation. To be saved all we need to do is come and receive what God has prepared for us. As long as we answer His invitation and accept what He has prepared for us, we shall be saved.<h2 class=head4>(5) The Love of the Triune God toward Sinners</h2><p>The Lord&#8217;s word in Luke 15:3-32 unveils the love of the Triune God toward sinners. In answering the self-righteous Pharisees and scribes, who condemned Him for eating with sinners (vv. 1-2), the Lord Jesus spoke three parables, unveiling and depicting how the divine Trinity works to bring sinners back, through the Son by the Spirit, to the Father. The Son came in His humanity as the shepherd to find the sinner as a lost sheep and bring it back home (vv. 4-7). The Spirit seeks the sinner as a woman seeks carefully one lost coin until she finds it (vv. 8-10). And the Father receives the repenting and returned sinner as a certain man receives his prodigal son (vv. 11-32). Hence, the divine Trinity treasures the sinner and participates in bringing him back to God.<p>The three parables in 15:3-32 emphasize the love of the divine Trinity more than the fallen condition and repentance of the penitent sinner. The divine love is fully expressed in the Son&#8217;s tender care as the good Shepherd, in the Spirit&#8217;s fine seeking as the treasure lover, and in the Father&#8217;s warm receiving as a loving father.<p>The sequence of the Trinity in Luke 15 is different from that in Matthew 28:19. In Matthew 28:19 the sequence is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. But in Luke we first have the Son as the shepherd, then the Spirit as the woman, and finally the Father as the father receiving his returned son. This sequence is the same as that in Ephesians 2:18: &#8220;Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&#8221; According to this verse, through the Son and in the Spirit we have access unto the Father.<p>The reason the Son is mentioned first in Luke 15 is that in God&#8217;s salvation the One who comes, practically speaking, is the Son. The Son comes to accomplish redemption, the foundation of our salvation. Then the Spirit comes to seek us and find us. Because of the Spirit&#8217;s finding of us, we repent and come back to God the Father. According to the third parable in Luke 15, the Father is waiting for us to come back. This wonderful sequence is according to the steps of God&#8217;s salvation, the salvation based on Christ&#8217;s redemption. God&#8217;s salvation is by the Son, through the Spirit, and unto the Father.<h2 class=head4>(6) Our Need to Humble Ourselves</h2><p>In 18:9-14 we have Christ&#8217;s teaching about our need to humble ourselves in order to enter into the kingdom of God. In verses 10 through 13 the Lord tells of two men who went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The prayer of the Pharisee (vv. 11-12) sounds not like a prayer but rather like an accusation of others and an arrogant boast to God. &#8220;But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!&#8221; (v. 13). This implies the need of a Redeemer and also of propitiation. The tax collector realized how his sinfulness offended God. Hence, he asked God to be propitiated, to be appeased toward him by a propitiation, so that He may be merciful and gracious to him.<p>It is significant that the tax collector said, &#8220;God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!&#8221; He realized that he had offended God and that he needed someone to be his offering of propitiation so that God would be appeased. This humbled person realized that he was nothing but a sinner. Because he offered up a prayer that was based upon God&#8217;s propitiation, he &#8220;went down to his house justified&#8221; (v. 14).<p>In 14b the Lord concludes, &#8220;Everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted.&#8221; Every saved person should be one who humbles himself to the same extent the tax collector did. Actually, to repent and confess our sins is to humble ourselves. All saved ones are those who have been humbled and subdued. We need to humble ourselves to such an extent that we consider ourselves nobody and nothing.<h2 class=head4>(7) Entering into the Kingdom of God</h2><p>In 18:18-30 we see that if we would enter into the kingdom of God, we need to renounce all and follow the Lord Jesus. In particular, we need to renounce material possessions.<p>Verse 18 says, &#8220;A certain ruler questioned Him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?&#8221; To inherit eternal life is different from having eternal life. According to the Gospel of John, to have eternal life is to be saved with God&#8217;s uncreated life so that we may live by this life today and for eternity. But to inherit eternal life is to share in the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age.<p>Eventually, the Lord Jesus said to the ruler, &#8220;Yet one thing you are lacking: all things, whatever you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me&#8221; (v. 22). Here we see that to follow the Lord Jesus requires that we love Him above all things. This is the supreme requirement for entering into the kingdom of God.<p>When the Lord Jesus observed that this ruler became sorrowful because he was exceedingly rich, He said, &#8220;How difficult it is for those who hold on to riches to go into the kingdom of God. For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God&#8221; (vv. 24-25). The Greek word for &#8220;needle&#8221; indicates a surgeon&#8217;s needle. The Lord&#8217;s word here indicates the impossibility of entering into the kingdom of God by our natural life.<p>Those who heard the Lord&#8217;s word said, &#8220;Then who can be saved?&#8221; (v. 26). They confused salvation with the kingdom of God. The Lord&#8217;s word to the ruler concerned entering into the kingdom of God. But the disciples thought that it referred to salvation. Having the natural concept of being saved, they did not grasp the Lord&#8217;s revelation concerning entering into the kingdom of God.<p>In verse 27 the Lord Jesus went on to say, &#8220;The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.&#8221; By our human life it is impossible to enter into the kingdom of God. But this is possible by God&#8217;s life, the divine life, which is Christ Himself imparted into us so that we may live the kingdom life.<p>In verse 30 the Lord speaks of receiving eternal life in the coming age. This is the life which the overcoming believers will enjoy in the coming kingdom. To enter into this enjoyment in the coming age is to enter into the coming kingdom and participate in its enjoyment of eternal life.<h2 class=head3>b. The New Testament Economy</h2><p>In Matthew 9:15-17 and 12:3-8 we have Christ&#8217;s teaching concerning the New Testament economy.<h2 class=head4>(1) The Bridegroom, the New Garment, the New Wine, and the Fresh Wineskin</h2><p>In answer to the question asked by certain disciples of John the Baptist regarding fasting, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?&#8221; (Matt. 9:15a). The &#8220;sons of the bridechamber&#8221; refer to Christ&#8217;s disciples. In the transitory period of His earthly ministry, His disciples were the sons of the bridechamber. Later they will become the bride (John 3:29; Rev. 19:7). The crucial point here is that the Lord Jesus reveals Himself as the Bridegroom to take the bride. John the Baptist had told his disciples that Christ was the Bridegroom (John 3:25-29). Now Christ reminded them of this. The followers of the Lord Jesus should appropriate Him as their Bridegroom so that they may have a living enjoyment in His presence.<p>In Matthew 9:16 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &#8220;Now no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.&#8221; The unshrunk cloth signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion as a piece of new cloth, whereas the new garment in Luke 5:36 signifies Christ, after being treated in His crucifixion, as a new robe. First, Christ was the unshrunk cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection He was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God so that we may be justified by God and acceptable to Him (Luke 15:22; Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 1:30). The Lord&#8217;s intention was to give Himself to us not as a piece of unshrunk cloth but as a complete, finished garment that we may put on as our righteousness. Hence, Christ is not only the Bridegroom but also a finished garment that we may put on as our righteousness.<p>In Matthew 9:17 the Lord Jesus continues, &#8220;Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.&#8221; The new wine here signifies Christ as the new life, full of vigor, stirring us to excitement. The new wine is Christ&#8217;s cheering life. When we receive His life, it works within us to stir us up and excite us, to strengthen us, energize us, and make us happy. Christ, therefore, is not only the Bridegroom for our enjoyment and our new garment to cover us, but also our new life to excite us for the enjoyment of Him as our Bridegroom. In order to enjoy Christ as the Bridegroom, we need Him as our new garment outwardly and as our new wine inwardly.<p>In 9:17 the Lord Jesus said that we should not put new wine into old wineskins. Old wineskins signify religious practices, such as the fasting practiced by the Pharisees and the disciples of John in their religion. All religions are old wineskins. New wine put into old wineskins bursts the wineskins by its fermenting power. To put new wine into old wineskins is to put Christ as the exciting life into any kind of religion, into different modes of religious ritual and formality. The new wine, however, requires a fresh wineskin.<p>The fresh wineskins in 9:17 signify the church life in the local churches as the container of the new wine, which is Christ Himself as the exciting life. The believers are built into the church (16:18), and the church is expressed through the local churches in which they live (18:15-20). The believers in Christ are regenerated persons constituting the Body of Christ to be the church (Rom. 12:5; Eph. 1:22-23). This Body of Christ as His fullness is also called &#8220;the Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:12, lit), the corporate Christ. The individual Christ is the new wine, the exciting life inwardly, and the corporate Christ is the fresh wineskin, the container to hold the new wine outwardly. Here we have the church life with Christ as the contents.<p>As the new wineskin, the church is actually the enlargement of Christ. When the individual Christ as the wine within us is enlarged into a corporate Christ, that is the church. This corporate Christ is the wineskin, the container, to contain the individual Christ as our wine. Thus, the church is a corporate entity full of Christ, for the church is Christ enlarged.<p>Christ is not only our new garment and new wine, but, being increased, He is also our new wineskin to contain the wine. He is our outward qualification, He is our inward satisfaction, and, in a corporate way, He is the church, the Body, capable of holding the wine. In the New Testament economy Christ is everything. He is the Bridegroom, the new garment, the new wine, and the corporate vessel to contain what we enjoy of Him.<h2 class=head4>(2) The Real David, the One Greater Than the Temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath</h2><p>In Matthew 12:3-8 Christ continues His teaching concerning the New Testament economy. When the Pharisees told Him that it was not lawful for His disciples to pick ears of grain on the Sabbath, He said, &#8220;Have you not read what David did when he was hungry and those who were with him; how he entered into the house of God, and they ate the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but for the priests only?&#8221; (vv. 3-4). The Lord&#8217;s word here implies that He is the real David. In ancient times David and his followers, when rejected, entered into the house of God and ate the showbread, apparently breaking the Levitical law. Now the real David and His followers were also rejected and took action to eat, apparently against the sabbatical regulation. Just as David and his followers were not held guilty, neither should Christ and His disciples be condemned. King David was a prefigure of Christ, the real David. David had followers and Christ, the real David, also had disciples as His followers. King David and his followers were rejected by the people, and the real David and his followers were rejected also. Just as David and his followers were hungry, so Christ and His disciples were hungry. Furthermore, neither David and his followers nor Christ and His followers had anything to eat, but there was a place where there was something to eat. For David it was the house of God, and for Christ it was the grainfield. All this implies that David and his followers were a type of Christ and His disciples.<p>It is important for us to see that Christ&#8217;s word here implies the dispensational change from the priesthood to the kingship. In ancient times the coming of David changed the dispensation from the age of the priests to the age of the kings, in which the kings were above the priests. In the age of the priests the leader of the people should listen to the priest (Num. 27:21-22). But in the age of the kings the priest should submit to the king (1 Sam. 2:35-36). Hence, what King David did with his followers was not illegal. Now by the coming of Christ the dispensation has also been changed, this time from the age of the law to the age of grace, in which Christ is above all. Whatever He does is right. The matter of keeping the Sabbath belonged to the old dispensation of the law. But in the age of grace Christ has the final word. It is not a matter of law but of Christ.<p>In Matthew 12:5 and 6 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &#8220;Have you not read in the law that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? Now I say to you that a greater than the temple is here.&#8221; Christ&#8217;s revealing to the Pharisees that He is greater than the temple is another change, a type-fulfilling change from the temple to a person. In the case of David the change was from one age to another. In this case, a case concerning the priests, it is a change from the temple to One who is greater than the temple. Because the priests were guiltless in doing things on the Sabbath in the temple, how could Christ&#8217;s disciples be guilty in doing things on the Sabbath in Him who is greater than the temple? Apparently the priests were profaning the Sabbath, but actually they were not profaning the Sabbath, because they were in the temple, in a sphere where every day and everything was holy. Likewise, every day was sanctified by the temple. Everything, every day, every matter, and everyone in the temple were holy. The temple, however, was a shadow, not the reality. The reality is Christ, the One who is greater than the temple.<p>Finally, in Matthew 12:8 the Lord said, &#8220;The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.&#8221; Here the Lord indicated a third change, a right-asserting change from the Sabbath to the Lord of the Sabbath. As the Lord of the Sabbath, Christ has the right to change the regulations concerning the Sabbath. Therefore, in Matthew 12 He gave the condemning Pharisees a threefold verdict. He was the real David, the greater temple, and the Lord of the Sabbath. As such a One, He could do whatever He liked on the Sabbath, and whatever He did was justified by Himself. In the New Testament economy Christ is above all rituals and regulations.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(6)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of the truths taught by Christ in His earthly ministry.<h2 class=head3>c. The Kingdom</h2><h2 class=head4>(1) The Decree of the Kingdom&#8217;s Constitution</h2><p>The word spoken by Christ as the constitution of the kingdom (Matt. 5:1-7:29) is a revelation of the spiritual living and heavenly principles of the kingdom of the heavens. It is composed of seven sections (5:1-12; 5:13-16; 5:17-48; 6:1-18; 6:19-34; 7:1-12; 7:13-29).<p>The first section, 5:1-12, depicts the nature of the people of the kingdom of the heavens under nine blessings. They are people poor in spirit, mourning for the present situation, meek in suffering opposition, hungry and thirsty for righteousness, merciful toward others, pure in heart, making peace with all men, suffering persecution for righteousness, reproached and evil spoken of. To be poor in spirit (v. 3) is to be emptied in our spirit, in the depths of our being, in order to realize and possess the kingdom of the heavens. To mourn (v. 4) according to God and His economy is to mourn over the situation of the world, which is altogether contrary to God&#8217;s economy. To be meek (v. 5) means not to resist the world&#8217;s opposition but to suffer it willingly. To hunger and thirst for righteousness (v. 6) is to seek to be right in our behavior. To be merciful (v. 7) is to give others what they do not deserve. To be pure in heart (v. 8) is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God&#8217;s will for God&#8217;s glory (1 Cor. 10:31). To be a peacemaker (v. 9) is to make peace with all men (Heb. 12:14) by behaving in the Father&#8217;s life and according to His peaceful nature. To be persecuted for the sake of righteousness (v. 10) is to pay a price for the righteousness we seek for the kingdom of the heavens. When we live a life for the kingdom of the heavens in its spiritual nature and according to its heavenly principle, we shall be reproached, persecuted, and evil spoken of for the Lord&#8217;s sake (v. 11). This persecution is directly for the sake of Christ because of our following Him.<p>When the Lord Jesus speaks of the influence of the kingdom people upon the world (5:13-16), He says that they are the salt of the earth (v. 13) and the light of the world (v. 14). Salt by nature is an element that kills and eliminates the germs of corruption. To the corrupted earth, the kingdom people are such an element, keeping the earth from being fully corrupted. Light is the shining of a lamp to enlighten those in darkness. To the darkened world, the people of the kingdom are such a light effacing its darkness. In nature they are the healing salt, and in behavior they are the shining light.<p>In the third section, 5:17-48, Christ decrees the law of the kingdom people. He says, &#8220;Do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill&#8221; (v. 17). To fulfill the law here means that Christ has kept the law on the positive side, that through His substitutionary death on the cross He has fulfilled the requirement of the law on the negative side, and that He complements the old law by His new law, as continually expressed by the word, &#8220;But I say to you&#8221; (vv. 22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44). Christ&#8217;s keeping of the law qualified Him to fulfill the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross. Christ&#8217;s fulfilling the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross brought in the resurrection life to complement the law, to fill the law to the full. The old law, the lower law, with its keeping-demand and punishing-requirement, is over. The kingdom people, as children of the Father, now only need to fulfill the new law, the higher law, by the resurrection life, which is the eternal life of the Father.<p>Concerning the law, there are two aspects: the commandments of the law and the principle of the law. The commandments of the law are fulfilled and complemented by the Lord&#8217;s coming, whereas the principle of the law is replaced by the principle of faith according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<p>In 5:20 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.&#8221; &#8220;Righteousness&#8221; here does not refer to the objective righteousness, which is the Christ we receive when we believe in Him that we may be justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 3:26); it refers to the subjective righteousness, which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future. This subjective righteousness is not obtained by merely fulfilling the old law, but by completing the old law through the fulfillment of the new law of the kingdom of the heavens given by Christ. This righteousness of the kingdom people, according to the new law of the kingdom, surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees according to the old law. It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can only be produced by a higher life, the resurrection life of Christ. This righteousness, which is likened to the marriage garment (Matt. 22:11-12), qualifies us to participate in the wedding of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-8) and inherit the kingdom of the heavens in its manifestation, that is, to enter into the kingdom of the heavens in the future.<p>In 5:48 the Lord concludes this section by saying, &#8220;You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.&#8221; For the kingdom people to be perfect as their Father is, is to be perfect in His love. They are the Father&#8217;s children, having the Father&#8217;s divine life and nature. Hence, they can be perfect like the Father. The demands of the new law of the kingdom can be met only by the divine life, not by the natural life. The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the divine life of the Father is the highest supply to meet this demand. The demand of the new law of the kingdom in Matthew 5 through 7 is actually the regenerated kingdom people&#8217;s expression from within their new life-the divine life. This demand, by opening up the inner being of the regenerated people, is to show them that they are able to attain to such a high degree.<p>The fourth section of the constitution of the kingdom (6:1-18) concerns the righteous deeds of the kingdom people. Verse 1 says, &#8220;Take heed not to do your righteousness before men to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you surely have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens.&#8221; Man&#8217;s flesh, seeking to glorify itself, always wants to do good deeds before men to be praised by them. But the kingdom people, who live in an emptied and humble spirit and walk in a pure and single heart under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, are not allowed to do anything in the flesh for the praise of men, but must do all things in the spirit for the pleasing of their heavenly Father. The new law of the kingdom is given to them with the intention that they should keep it not by their fallen human life, but by the Father&#8217;s eternal divine life, not to gain man&#8217;s glory, but to receive the Father&#8217;s reward.<p>The living of the kingdom people is by the Father&#8217;s divine life according to their spirit. Thus, they are required to do good things in secret, not in public (vv. 3-4). Any public exhibition does not correspond to the mysterious hidden nature of the divine life.<p>In 6:19-34, the fifth section, we have the Lord&#8217;s word concerning the dealing of the kingdom people with riches. In verse 20 the Lord says, &#8220;Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.&#8221; This is to give material things to the poor (Matt- 19:21) and to care for the needy saints (Acts 2:45; 4:34-35; 11:29; Rom. 15:26) and the Lord&#8217;s servants (Phil. 4:16-17). According to verse 21, the kingdom people must send their treasure to heaven so that their heart may also be in heaven.<p>In verse 24 the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.&#8221; &#8220;Mammon&#8221; is an Aramaic word signifying wealth, riches. Here mammon, standing in opposition to God, indicates that wealth or riches are the opponent of God, robbing God&#8217;s people of their service to Him.<p>As part of His word about anxiety, the Lord says, &#8220;Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you&#8221; (v. 33). The Father&#8217;s kingdom is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today and its manifestation in the coming age; the Father&#8217;s righteousness is the righteousness by keeping the new law of the kingdom. Because the kingdom people seek first the kingdom and righteousness of their heavenly Father, not only His kingdom and His righteousness will be given to them, but also their necessities will be added.<p>In the next section, 7:1-12, we have Christ&#8217;s word concerning the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others. He says, &#8220;Do not judge, lest you be judged; for with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you&#8221; (vv. 1-2). The kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, always judge themselves, not others. Under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, the kingdom people will be judged with what they judge. If they judge others with righteousness, they will be judged by the Lord with righteousness. If they judge others with mercy, they will be judged by the Lord with mercy.<p>Finally, in the last section (7:13-29) we have Christ&#8217;s teaching concerning the ground of the kingdom people&#8217;s living and work. Verses 13 and 14 say, &#8220;Enter in through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it. For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life, and few are those who find it.&#8221; The gate is narrow and the way is constricted because the new law of the kingdom is stricter and the demand of the kingdom is higher than that of the old covenant. It deals not only with outward conduct but also with inward motive. The old man, the self, the flesh, the human concept, and the world with its glory are all excluded. Only that which corresponds to God&#8217;s will can enter in. First the kingdom people need to enter such a narrow gate and then walk in such a constricted way. To enter the gate is to begin walking the way, a way which is lifelong.<p>In verse 21 the Lord says, &#8220;Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.&#8221; To enter into the kingdom of the heavens we need to call on the Lord and do the will of the heavenly Father. To call on the Lord suffices for us to be saved (Rom. 10:13), but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens we also need to do the will of the heavenly Father. Because entering into the kingdom of the heavens requires doing the will of the heavenly Father, it is clearly different from entering into the kingdom of God by being regenerated (John 3:3, 5). This latter is by the birth of the divine life; the former is by the living of that life.<p>In 7:24 the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;Everyone therefore who hears these words of Mine and does them shall be likened to a prudent man, who built his house on the rock.&#8221; The rock here refers to Christ&#8217;s wise word, the word that reveals the will of His Father. The kingdom people&#8217;s living and work must be founded on the word of Christ for the accomplishment of the will of the heavenly Father. This is to enter the narrow gate and walk the constricted way which leads to life.<h2 class=head4>(2) The Unveiling of the Kingdom&#8217;s Mysteries</h2><p>In Matthew 13:1-52 we have the unveiling of the kingdom&#8217;s mysteries. This unveiling is given in the seven parables recorded in this chapter.<p>In 13:1-23 we have with the parable of the sower the preliminary work of the kingdom. Verse 3 says, &#8220;Behold, the sower went out to sow.&#8221; The sower is the Lord Himself (v. 37), and the seeds (v. 4) are the word of the kingdom (v. 19) with the Lord in this word as life. Seed fell beside the way  (v. 4), on rocky places (v. 5), on thorns (v. 7), and on good ground (v. 8). The wayside signifies the heart that is hardened by worldly traffic and does not open to understand the word of the kingdom (v. 19). The rocky places signify the heart that is shallow in receiving the word of the kingdom because of the things hidden in such a heart (vv. 20-21). The thorns signify the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches, which choke the word from growing in the heart and cause it to become unfruitful (v. 22). The good ground signifies the good heart, a heart that gives every inch of its ground to receive the word so that it may grow, bear fruit, and produce even a hundredfold (v. 23).<p>In 13:24-30 and 36-43 we see the establishment of the kingdom and its false constituents. Verses 24 and 25 say, &#8220;The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field. But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares amidst the wheat and went away.&#8221; The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man (v. 37), the field is the world, the good seed are the sons of the kingdom, and the tares are the sons of the evil one (v. 38). Both the tares and the wheat grow in the field; that is, the false believers and the true ones live in the world. The kingdom of the heavens was established with the sons of the kingdom, the wheat, but the sons of the evil one, the tares, grew up to alter the situation. Hence, a difference has arisen between the kingdom of the heavens and its outward appearance. Whereas the sons of the kingdom constitute the kingdom, the sons of the evil one have formed the outward appearance of the kingdom, which today is called Christendom.<p>In verse 33 we have a parable concerning the inward corruption of the outward appearance of the kingdom: &#8220;The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.&#8221; Leaven in Scripture signifies evil things (1 Cor. 5:6, 8) and evil doctrines (Matt. 16:6, 11-12). The meal here, for making the meal offering (Lev. 2:1), signifies Christ as food for God and man. Three measures is the quantity needed to make a full meal (Gen. 18:6). The church, as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ-the unleavened fine flour-as its contents, should be unleavened bread (1 Cor. 5:7-8). However, the Catholic Church, which was fully and officially formed in the sixth century and which is signified here by the woman, took many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ to leaven the whole content of Christianity. Hence, the hiding of leaven in three measures of meal signifies that the Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. This became the inward corrupted content of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.<p>In 13:44 we see the kingdom hidden in the God-created world: &#8220;The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and in his joy goes and sells all, whatever he has, and buys that field.&#8221; The field is the earth, which signifies the world created by God for His kingdom. The treasure hidden in the field must consist of gold or precious stone, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem (1 Cor. 3:12; Rev. 21:18-20). Since the church is the practical kingdom today and the New Jerusalem will be the kingdom in manifestation in the coming age, so the treasure hidden in the field signifies the kingdom hidden in the God-created world. The man who finds this treasure is Christ. He found the kingdom in chapters 4:12 to 12:23, hid it in 12:24 to 13:43, and in His joy went to the cross in 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; and 26:1 to 27:52 to sell all He had to buy the field-to redeem the created and lost earth-for the kingdom.<p>In 13:45 and 46 we have the church produced out of the Satan-corrupted world: &#8220;Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking fine pearls, and finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all, whatever he had, and bought it.&#8221; The merchant here is Christ, who was seeking the church for His kingdom. After finding it in 16:18 and 18:17, He went to the cross and sold all He had and bought it for the kingdom. The pearl, produced in the death waters (the world filled with death) by the living oyster (the living Christ), wounded by a little rock (the sinner), and secreting its life juice around the wounding rock (the believer), is also the material for the building of the New Jerusalem. Because the pearl comes out of the sea, which signifies the world corrupted by Satan (Isa. 57:20; Rev. 17:15), it must refer to the church, which is mainly constituted of regenerated believers from the Gentile world and which is of great value.<p>Finally, in 13:47-50 we see the eternal gospel and its result. This parable corresponds to 25:32-46. The net in verse 47 does not signify the gospel of grace, which is preached in the church age, but signifies the eternal gospel, which will be preached to the Gentile world in the great tribulation (Rev. 14:6-7). The sea signifies the Gentile world, and &#8220;every kind&#8221; signifies all the Gentiles (Matt. 25:32). The &#8220;good&#8221; in verse 48 are the sheep, and the &#8220;corrupt&#8221; are the goats. The &#8220;furnace of fire&#8221; in verse 50 is the lake of fire (Matt. 25:41; Rev. 20:10, 15).<h2 class=head4>(3) The Kingdom Reward</h2><p>The parable in Matthew 20:1-16, which is an explanation of the Lord&#8217;s word to Peter in 19:28-30, concerns the kingdom reward. Peter thought that he was able to pay the price of buying the kingdom, but the Lord indicated to him that the kingdom is priceless and cannot be purchased. Because the kingdom is of peerless worth, we cannot buy it. What the Lord had asked Peter to give up was not the price of gaining the kingdom. He had simply asked Peter to give up all entanglements and frustrations. The kingdom is not a recompense; it is a reward. Peter needed to realize that, having forsaken every entanglement and frustration, he would receive the kingdom as a reward, not as a recompense. This means that the Lord does not act according to the commercial principle which says that the more we pay, the more we receive. The full enjoyment of eternal life in the manifestation of the kingdom is priceless. The price we pay cannot compare with the reward we shall receive. Therefore, receiving the reward is not a commercial transaction. It is not a matter of paying a certain amount and of receiving something equal to that in value.<p>In 20:1-16 the Lord goes on to speak a parable to further illustrate the impossibility of earning the kingdom or of paying a certain price for it. He tells of a householder who has a vineyard and who goes out at different times during the day to hire workmen. Then in the evening the householder pays the workmen, beginning with the last group and concluding with the first group and giving each worker the same thing-a denarius. Some murmured saying, &#8220;These last have worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat&#8221; (v. 12). Then the householder, who denotes Christ, replied, &#8220;Friend, I am not wronging you; did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what is yours and go. I desire to give to this last one even as to you. Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine?&#8221; (vv. 13-15a). This was a strong answer to Peter from the Lord, indicating that the Lord had given him what He thought he deserved. But the Lord was right to give the same thing to the latest workmen according to His own wish, in the principle not of work but of grace.<p>Peter&#8217;s concept, in dealing with the Lord in 19:27, was altogether commercial, according to the principle of work. In His answer to Peter the Lord strongly indicated that His reward to His followers is not commercial but according to His desire and grace. For the disciples to gain the kingdom of the heavens, they need to leave all and follow the Lord. But what He will give them as a reward is more than they deserve. It is not according to the principle of commerce but according to the Lord&#8217;s good pleasure. This is an incentive to His followers.<h2 class=head4>(4) The Transfer of the Kingdom</h2><p>In Matthew 21:33-45 we see the transfer of the kingdom of God from Israel to the church. In verse 33 the householder is God, the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem (Isa. 5:1), and the husbandmen are the leaders of the Israelites. The slaves in verses 34 through 36 are the Old Testament prophets, and the son in verses 37 and 38 is Christ. Verse 38 indicates that the Jewish leaders were jealous of Christ&#8217;s rights, wanting to maintain their false position. As a result, Christ was killed outside the city of Jerusalem (v. 39; Heb. 13:12). The stone in verse 42 is Christ for God&#8217;s building (Isa. 28:16; Zech. 3:9; 1 Pet. 2:4), and the builders are the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to work on God&#8217;s building. In verse 43 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it.&#8221; This nation is the church. Therefore, the Lord reveals the transfer of the kingdom from Israel to the church.<h2 class=head4>(5) The Kingdom&#8217;s Marriage Feast</h2><p>In Matthew 22:1-14 we have Christ&#8217;s teaching concerning the kingdom&#8217;s marriage feast. &#8220;The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made a marriage feast for his son&#8221; (v. 2). The king is God, and the son is Christ. As the Bridegroom, Christ is the center of the marriage feast. God has prepared a marriage feast, and Christ is its center. Through this parable the Lord Jesus indicates that He is the center of the universe, for He is the Bridegroom who has been designated by God the Father as the center of the universal marriage feast. He is the center of God&#8217;s economy. No one is more important at a marriage feast than the bridegroom. Christ as the Bridegroom is the center, the focus, of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. We all need to realize that Christ is the focus and center of God&#8217;s economy for our enjoyment.<p>Verses 3 and 4 say, &#8220;He sent his slaves to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, and they would not come. Again he sent other slaves, saying, Tell those who were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatted beasts are killed, and all things are ready; come to the marriage feast.&#8221; The slaves are the apostles sent by the Lord, and the oxen and fatted beasts refer to Christ as the One killed so that God&#8217;s chosen people may enjoy Him as a feast.<p>A crucial element in the parable of the marriage feast is the wedding garment: &#8220;When the king came in and beheld those reclining at the table, he saw there a man not clothed with a marriage garment&#8221; (v. 11). This marriage garment is typified by the raiment of embroidery in Psalm 45:14 and signified by the fine linen in Revelation 19:8. This is the surpassing righteousness of the overcoming believers in Matthew 5:20. The man not clothed with a marriage garment is saved, for he has come to the marriage feast. He has received Christ as his righteousness so that he might be justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 3:26), but he has not lived Christ out as his subjective righteousness so that he might participate in the enjoyment of the kingdom of the heavens. He has been called to salvation, but he has not been chosen for the enjoyment of the kingdom of the heavens (v. 14), which is only for the overcoming believers.<p>As believers in Christ, we should have two garments. We all have the first garment, the garment that qualifies us to be saved. This garment is the objective Christ whom we have received as our righteousness before God. In Christ, who is our righteousness, we have been justified and saved. But after receiving Christ, we need to live Him out. We need to live Christ so that He may become our subjective righteousness. This subjective righteousness, Christ lived out of us in our daily life, is the white linen, the second garment, the marriage garment that qualifies us to participate in the marriage feast. Therefore, we need both objective and subjective righteousness. This is an important matter in the Gospel of Matthew, for it is a requirement of the kingdom.<p>In 22:14 the Lord Jesus concludes, &#8220;Many are called but few are chosen.&#8221; To be called is to receive salvation (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 4:1), whereas to be chosen is to receive a reward. All believers have been called, but few will be chosen as overcomers. The overcomers, the chosen ones, will be rewarded and qualified to participate in the marriage feast of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9).<h2 class=head3>d. The Church</h2><h2 class=head4>(1) Universal</h2><p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&#8221; This is a revelation of the universal church, the unique Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). The words &#8220;My church&#8221; indicate that the church is of the Lord, not of any person or thing; it is not like the denominations, which are denominated after some person&#8217;s name or according to some thing.<p>The Lord says in verse 18 that the gates of Hades will not prevail against His church. The gates of Hades refer to Satan&#8217;s authority, or power, of darkness (Col. 1:13; Acts 26:18), which cannot prevail against the genuine church built by Christ upon the revelation concerning Him as the rock, with stones such as Peter, a transformed human being. This word of the Lord also indicates that Satan&#8217;s power of darkness will attack the church. Hence, there is spiritual warfare between Satan&#8217;s power, which is his kingdom, and the church, which is God&#8217;s kingdom.<h2 class=head4>(2) Local</h2><p>In Matthew 18:17 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church.&#8221; Whereas the church revealed in 16:18 is the universal church, the unique Body of Christ, the church revealed here is the local church, the expression of the unique Body of Christ in a certain locality. Chapter sixteen relates to the universal building of the church, but chapter eighteen relates to the local practice of the church. The universal church in 16:18 requires the practicality of the local church in 18:17. Without the local church the universal church cannot be practiced. The local church is the practicality of the universal church. The universal church as the Body of Christ is expressed through the local churches. The universal church, therefore, is realized in the local churches.<h2 class=head3>e. The Dispensing of the Triune God into His Believers, Making them Parts of the Organism of the Triune God</h2><p>In John 14:1-16:25a we have the Lord&#8217;s teaching concerning the dispensing of the Triune God into His believers, making them parts of the organism of the Triune God. John 14:1-31 reveals the dispensing of the Triune God for the producing of His abode. Verses 1 through 6 speak of Jesus going through death and Christ coming in resurrection to bring the believers into the Father. In verse 2 the Lord says, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.&#8221; The Father&#8217;s house, according to the book&#8217;s own interpretation in 2:16 and 21, is the temple, the body of Christ, as God&#8217;s dwelling place. At first the body of Christ was His individual body. Through His death and resurrection the body of Christ has increased to be His corporate Body, including all His believers, regenerated through His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3), who are the church. In His resurrection, the church is the Body of Christ, which is the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 2:5; Heb. 3:6), God&#8217;s habitation (Eph. 2:21-22), God&#8217;s temple. The many abodes in John 14:2 are the many members of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:5), which is God&#8217;s temple. This is proved by John 14:23, which says that the Lord and the Father will make an abode with the one who loves Him.<p>In 14:3 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &#8220;If I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be.&#8221; This word indicates that Christ&#8217;s going (through His death and resurrection) is His coming (to the disciples-vv. 18, 28). He came in the flesh (1:14) and was among His disciples, but He could not get into them in the flesh. It was necessary for Him to take the further step of passing through death and resurrection so that He might be transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit in order to come into them and dwell in them, as revealed in 14:17-20.<p>Christ&#8217;s intention is to bring man into God for the building of His dwelling place. But between man and God there are many obstacles, such as sin, sins, death, the world, the flesh, the self, the old man, and Satan. For the Lord Jesus to bring man into God He had to solve all these problems. Therefore, He had to go to the cross to accomplish redemption so that He might open the way and make a standing for man to get into God. The standing in God, being enlarged, becomes the standing in the Body of Christ. Anyone who does not have the standing, a place, in God, does not have a place in the Body of Christ, which is God&#8217;s dwelling place. Hence, Christ&#8217;s going to accomplish redemption was to prepare a place in His Body for the disciples.<p>The Lord Jesus is in the Father. He wanted His disciples also to be in the Father, as revealed in 17:21. Through His death and resurrection He brought His disciples into Himself. Because He is in the Father, so they also are in the Father by being in Him.<p>John 14:7-20 reveals the Triune God dispensing Himself into the believers. In verses 7 through 14 we have the Father embodied in the Son seen among the believers, and in verses 15 through 20, the Son realized as the Spirit abiding in the believers. This chapter unveils the Triune God for the dispensing of Himself into the believers. He is the only one God, yet He is three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father, and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son. In the Son (the Son is even called the Father-Isa. 9:6) the Father is expressed and seen, and as the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17) the Son is revealed and realized. The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers. God the Father is hidden, God the Son is manifested among men, and God the Spirit enters into man to be his life, life supply, and everything. Hence, the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit is man&#8217;s portion so that man may enjoy the Triune God.<p>Regarding the Son realized as the Spirit, verses 16 and 17 say, &#8220;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&#8221; The Spirit promised here has been referred to in 7:39. This is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), and this promise of the Lord was fulfilled on the day of His resurrection, when the Spirit was breathed into the disciples as the breath of life (John 20:22).<p>The very &#8220;He&#8221; who is the Spirit of reality in John 14:17, becomes the very &#8220;I&#8221; who is the Lord Himself in verse 18. This indicates that after His resurrection the Lord became the Spirit of reality, as confirmed in 1 Corinthians 15:45b.<p>In 14:20 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &#8220;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; The day here refers to the day of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. Since His resurrection the Lord lives in His disciples and they live by Him, as mentioned in Galatians 2:20.<p>In 14:21-24 the Lord speaks regarding the Triune God making His abode with the believers. In verse 23 He says, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; The abode here is one of the many abodes spoken of in verse 2. Eventually, this will be a mutual abode for the Triune God to abide in the believers and for the believers to abide in Him.<p>John 14:25-31 reveals the Comforter&#8217;s reminding and Christ&#8217;s peace. Verse 26 says, &#8220;The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and remind you of all things which I said to you.&#8221; The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, will be sent by the Father in the Son&#8217;s name. Hence, the Holy Spirit comes in the Son&#8217;s name to be the reality of the name. The name is the Son Himself, and the Spirit is the person, the being, of the Son. Therefore, when we call on the name of the Son, we receive the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3).<p>John 15:1-16:4 reveals the organism of the Triune God in the divine dispensing. In 15:1 the Lord says, &#8220;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.&#8221; This true vine, which is the Son, with its branches, which are the believers in the Son, is the organism of the Triune God in God&#8217;s economy to grow with His riches and to express His divine life.<p>Literally, the Greek word for &#8220;husbandman&#8221; here means cultivator of the soil, land-worker, farmer (2 Tim. 2:6; James 5:7; Matt. 21:33). Thus, the Father, as the husbandman, is the source, the author, the planner, the planter, the life, the substance, the soil, the water, the air, the sunshine, and everything to the vine. The Son as the vine is the center of God&#8217;s economy and the embodiment of all the riches of the Father. The Father, by cultivating the Son, works Himself with all His riches into this vine, and eventually the vine expresses the Father through its branches in a corporate way. This is the Father&#8217;s economy in the universe.<p>In 15:26 the Lord says, &#8220;When the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me.&#8221; The sense of the Greek word rendered &#8220;from&#8221; is &#8220;from with.&#8221; The Spirit of reality is sent by the Son, not only from the Father but also with the Father. The Comforter comes from the Father and with the Father. The Father is the source. When the Spirit comes from the source, He does not leave the source but the source comes with Him. This Spirit, sent by the Son and coming with the Father, will testify concerning the Son. Therefore, His testimony concerning the Son is a matter of the Triune God.<p>The Lord&#8217;s word in 16:5-33 reveals the work of the Spirit unto the mingling of divinity with humanity. In verses 5 through 7 we see the Son&#8217;s going for the Spirit&#8217;s coming. Verses 8 through 15 reveal the work of the Spirit to convict the world (vv. 8-11) and to glorify the Son by revealing Him with the fullness of the Father to the believers (vv. 12-15). The work of the Spirit is first to convict the world, and then, as the Spirit of reality, to guide the believers into all the reality (v. 13). This is to make all that the Son is and has real to the believers. All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son (Col. 2:9), and all that the Son is and has is revealed as reality to the believers through the Spirit (John 16:14-15). This is to glorify the Son with the Father. Hence, it is a matter of the Triune God wrought into and mingled with the believers. Finally, the Spirit will disclose the things to come, which are mainly revealed in Revelation (Rev. 1:1, 19). These three aspects of the Spirit&#8217;s work correspond to the three sections of John&#8217;s writing: the Gospel, the Epistles, and the Revelation.<p>John 16:16-24 reveals the Son born in resurrection as a newborn child. In verses 21 and 22 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;When a woman gives birth she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world. And you therefore now indeed have sorrow; but I shall see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.&#8221; Here the Lord indicates that the disciples would be like a woman travailing in birth and that He would be the child to be brought forth in His resurrection (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5; Rom. 1:4). After being born in resurrection, He came to see the disciples in the evening of the day of His resurrection, and the disciples rejoiced at His presence (John 20:20).<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(7)</h1><p>In this message we shall complete our study of Christ&#8217;s work in His earthly ministry.<h2 class=head2>15. Cleansing the Temple</h2><p>The Lord Jesus cleansed the temple twice, at the beginning of His earthly ministry and at the end. John 2:14 through 16 says that He &#8220;found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there. And having made a whip of cords, He drove them all, both the sheep and the oxen, out of the temple, and He poured out the coins of the moneychangers and overturned the tables; and to those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away; do not make My Father&#8217;s house a house of merchandise.&#8221; Here the Lord Jesus dealt with the house of God by cleansing it with a whip, or a scourge, made of cords. Verse 17 says, &#8220;His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of Your house shall devour Me.&#8221; Within the Lord Jesus was a zeal for the house of God. This zeal devoured Him, ate Him up, consumed Him. He was absolutely for God&#8217;s house. When He saw the corrupted situation in the temple, He could not tolerate it. Because His heart was pure for the Father, He could not bear to see that the temple, His Father&#8217;s house, was defiled, contaminated by the things of man&#8217;s greed. Therefore, driven by zeal for His Father&#8217;s house, He cleansed it, driving the defilement out of it.<p>Christ&#8217;s cleansing of the temple the second time is recorded in Matthew 21:12 and 13. After He entered the city of Jerusalem, the first thing He did was to cleanse the temple. Any earthly king, upon entering the capital, would immediately have ascended to the throne. But the Lord Jesus did not do this, because He was not for His own interests but for God&#8217;s interests. His heart was not for His kingdom but for God&#8217;s house.<h2 class=head2>16. Living the Father</h2><p>In John 6:57 the Lord Jesus said that He lived because of the Father. Christ lived on earth not merely by the Father or through the Father but because of the Father. His living had a cause, and that cause was the Father. Hence, the Father was not simply an instrument through which or by which the Son lived; rather, the Father was the cause of the Son&#8217;s living on earth. Today Christ should be the cause of our daily living. We should live not only by Him and through Him but also because of Him. He should be the cause of our living. Otherwise, our living will be meaningless. Without the Father as His cause, the Son&#8217;s living on earth for thirty-three and a half years would have been vain. But His living was not vain, because the Son&#8217;s living had the Father as the cause.<h2 class=head2>17. Working with the Father</h2><p>In John 5 the Lord Jesus did the work of enlivening an impotent man. The religious Jews persecuted Him because He enlivened the impotent man on the Sabbath. He answered them, &#8220;My Father is working until now, and I am working&#8221; (5:17). In their religious concept they were resting and keeping their Sabbath. They did not know that there was no rest for the Father and the Son as long as the poor sinners were not saved. While the religious Jews were resting in keeping their Sabbath, the Father and the Son were working so that sinners might receive life and have rest.<p>Although God&#8217;s work in creation was finished (Gen. 2:1-3), in Christ&#8217;s earthly ministry the Father and the Son were still working for redemption and building (John 5:19-20). This work includes the Son&#8217;s life-giving, which is manifested in John 5. In this matter the Father and the Son are one. Whatever the Father wants to do in the matter of life-giving, the Son does accordingly.<p>The Lord Jesus never did any work without the Father. He always worked with the Father. This required the absolute denial of the self. Christ denied Himself in order to work with the Father.<p>As the Lord Jesus worked with the Father, He worked in the name of the Father (John 10:25). Having come in the Father&#8217;s name (John 5:43), He never did anything in His own name; He did everything in the Father&#8217;s name. For Him to work in the name of the Father means that He worked as the Father. The Lord Jesus and the Father were not working separately. On the contrary, the Lord was working with the Father as one.<p>When Christ worked with the Father, He worked not with the Father who was merely in heaven, but with the Father who was with Him and in Him. This truth concerning Christ&#8217;s working with the Father is contrary to the traditional teaching which says that when the Son was on earth, the Father was merely in the heavens. Economically, the Son was on earth and the Father was in the heavens. Essentially, however, while the Son was working on earth, the Father was living in Him and working with Him. Essentially, the Father and the Son are one (John 10:30); They cannot be separated. Therefore, Christ worked with the Father in the way of being one with Him.<h2 class=head2>18. Speaking the Father&#8217;s Word</h2><p>In His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus never spoke His own word. Whatever He spoke was the Father&#8217;s speaking. On one occasion He said, &#8220;My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me&#8221; (John 7:16). In not speaking from Himself the Lord did not seek His own glory but the glory of the One who sent Him (v. 18). Instead of speaking His own words, He spoke God. When He spoke God&#8217;s word, God was expressed through His speaking. God came forth from Him through His words. He lived a life of speaking God, a life of expressing God for His glory.<p>In John 12:49 and 50 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who sent Me has Himself given Me commandment what I should say and what I should speak. And I know that His commandment is eternal life. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak.&#8221; This clearly reveals that in His ministry the Lord spoke the Father&#8217;s word. In particular, the commandment that the Father gave Him to speak was eternal life. Therefore, He came with living words, and whoever receives His words will have eternal life.<p>In John 14:10 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, &#8220;The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works.&#8221; Once again the Lord makes it clear that He did not speak His own word but the Father&#8217;s word. While the Son was speaking in this way, the Father was working. The Son&#8217;s speaking was the Father&#8217;s working.<h2 class=head2>19. Doing the Father&#8217;s Will</h2><p>A number of times the Lord Jesus declared strongly that He did not do His own will, but that everything He did was the Father&#8217;s will. One day He said to His disciples, who had returned with food and were urging Him to eat: &#8220;My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work&#8221; (John 4:34). The Lord&#8217;s food was to do the will of the Father. In John 4 this means that, in particular, His food was to save and satisfy sinners. The Lord Jesus had come to Samaria with a purpose-to find a sinful Samaritan woman and satisfy her. In doing this He did God&#8217;s will, and doing God&#8217;s will was His food and satisfaction.<p>In John 6:38 the Lord Jesus says that He came down from heaven not to do His own will but the will of the Father who sent Him. In John 5:30 He says that He did not seek His own will but the will of the Father who sent Him. These verses indicate clearly that in His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus did not carry out His own will but the Father&#8217;s will.<h2 class=head2>20. Expressing the Father</h2><p>We know from the Gospel of John that Christ the Son came in the Father&#8217;s name, did the Father&#8217;s will, spoke the Father&#8217;s word, and sought the Father&#8217;s glory (7:18). He also expressed the Father (John 14:7-9). He did not express Himself but expressed only the Father. During His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus spoke much concerning the kingdom of God and the dispensing of the Triune God. But in all that He spoke He expressed the Father, not Himself.<p>The fact that the Son expresses the Father is proved by the exchange between the Lord Jesus and Philip in John 14. In verse 7 the Lord pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known the Father also. Then He said, &#8220;Henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.&#8221; However, Philip replied, &#8220;Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us&#8221; (v. 8). To this the Lord Jesus answered, &#8220;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&#8221; (v. 9). In the Son the Father is expressed and seen, for the Son is the expression of the Father. The Son does not express Himself; instead, He expresses the Father. The Son&#8217;s expression is the Father&#8217;s expression. Hence, when we see the Son, we see the Father.<h2 class=head2>21. Revealing the Father to the Disciples</h2><p>In His ministry the Lord Jesus revealed the Father to the disciples. Matthew 11:27 says, &#8220;No one knows the Son except the Father, neither does anyone know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.&#8221; This indicates that to know the Father requires the Son&#8217;s revelation. The Greek word for &#8220;wills&#8221; in verse 27 means to deliberately exercise the will through counsel. This the Lord did in revealing the Father to the disciples.<p>In His prayer to the Father before His crucifixion the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world&#8221; (John 17:6). The name referred to here is the name Father. The names &#8220;God&#8221; and &#8220;Jehovah&#8221; were adequately revealed to man in the Old Testament, but not the name Father, though it is mentioned in Isaiah 9:6; 63:16; and 64:8. In Old Testament times God&#8217;s people mainly knew that God was Elohim, that is, God, and Jehovah, that is, the ever-existing One, but they did not know much about the title Father. God is His name for creation, and Jehovah is His name for the relationship between Himself and man. Eventually, the Son came and worked in the Father&#8217;s name (John 5:43; 10:25) to manifest the Father to the ones whom the Father gave Him and to make the Father&#8217;s name known to them, the name which reveals the Father as the source of life (5:26) for the propagation and multiplication of life, of whom many sons are born (1:12-13) to express the Father. Hence, the Father&#8217;s name is very much related to the divine life.<p>In John 17:26 the Lord Jesus went on to say in His prayer, &#8220;I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known.&#8221; The Son made the Father&#8217;s name known to the believers not by teaching but by imparting life into them. As believers in Christ, we have the Father&#8217;s life. Because we are the same in life and nature as the Father, it is easy for us to know Him. As the Son of the Father, the Lord Jesus came to impart life into us. Because the Father&#8217;s life has been imparted into us, spontaneously the Father is made known to us by life, not by teaching. In life we know the Father.<p>In His work the Lord Jesus was truly one with the Father. He lived the Father, He worked with the Father, He spoke the Father&#8217;s word, He did the Father&#8217;s will, and He expressed the Father. Everything the Lord Jesus did was for the expression of the Father and was the carrying out of the Father&#8217;s will. From this we see that while He was ministering on earth the Lord was absolutely one with the Father, expressing Him, and in this way He revealed the Father to the disciples.<h2 class=head2>22. Undoing the Works of the Devil</h2><p>First John 3:8 reveals that as He ministered on earth the Lord Jesus was undoing the works of the Devil: &#8220;For this the Son of God was manifested, that He might undo the works of the Devil.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;undo&#8221; may also be translated loose, dissolve, destroy. Also, the Greek word translated &#8220;for this&#8221; literally means unto this, that is, to this end, for this purpose. The Devil sins continually from ancient times and begets sinners to practice sin with him. Hence, for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might undo and destroy the Devil&#8217;s sinful deeds-that is, condemn, through death on the cross in the flesh (Rom. 8:3), sin initiated by him, the evil one; destroy the power of sin, the sinful nature of the Devil (Heb. 2:14); and take away both sin and sins.<h2 class=head2>23. Prophesying the Things to Come and His Coming Back</h2><p>During His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus prophesied the things to come and His coming back (Matt. 24:3- 25:36). In verse 3 of Matthew 24 the disciples asked Him, &#8220;When shall these things be, and what is the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s answer is of three sections: the first section (24:4-31) concerns the Jews who are the elect; the second (24:32-25:30) concerns the church; and the third (25:31-46) concerns the Gentiles (the nations). The first section, concerning the Jews, should be literally interpreted, whereas the second section, concerning the church, should be spiritually interpreted because it is spoken in parables for the reason given in 13:11-13. For instance, the winter in 24:20 is an actual winter, but the summer in 24:32 is a symbol signifying the time of restoration. The third section, concerning the Gentiles, should also be literally interpreted.<p>The prophecy in 24:4-14 covers the time from Christ&#8217;s ascension to the end of the age. Some aspects of this prophecy have been fulfilled, and some are in the process of being fulfilled, until the time of the great tribulation, which will be the consummation, the end, of the age. The end spoken of in verse 6 is the consummation of the age (Dan. 12:4, 9, 6-7), which will be the three and a half years of the great tribulation.<p>Matthew 24:14 says, &#8220;This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end shall come.&#8221; The emphasis of the gospel of the kingdom is the heavenly ruling of God and the authority of the Lord. The gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole earth for a testimony to all the nations before the end of this age comes. This testimony must spread to the whole earth before the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation. The preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, therefore, will be a sign of the consummation of the age.<p>In 24:15-31 the Lord prophesies concerning the great tribulation (vv. 15-26), His coming to the earth (vv. 27-30), and the gathering of Israel (v. 31). How long the period of time will be for verses 4 through 14 no one knows. But the prophecy in verses 15 through 31 concerning the remnant of the Jews will definitely be fulfilled in the last three and a half years of this age, the time of the great tribulation, the second half of the last week prophesied in Daniel 9:27, beginning with the setting up of Antichrist&#8217;s image (the idol) in the temple (Matt. 24:15) and ending with Christ&#8217;s coming.<p>In Matthew 24:27 the Lord says, &#8220;As the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be.&#8221; The second coming of Christ has two aspects: one is the secret aspect toward His watchful believers; the other is the open aspect toward the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles. The lightning signifies the open aspect after the great tribulation (v. 29), whereas the thief&#8217;s coming in verse 43 signifies the secret aspect before the great tribulation.<p>In verse 31 the Lord goes on to say of Himself as the Son of Man, &#8220;He shall send His angels with a loud trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from the extremities of the heavens to their extremities.&#8221; After the great tribulation, at His coming back to earth, the Lord will gather together the scattered Jews from all parts of the earth to the holy land.<p>After prophesying concerning Israel, the Lord Jesus goes on in 24:32-25:30 to prophesy concerning the church. He charges the believers to watch and be ready (vv. 32-44) and to be faithful and prudent (vv. 45-51). In verses 37 and 38 He explains that the coming, the parousia, of the Son of Man will be as the days of Noah. This means that during the Lord&#8217;s parousia people will be befuddled by the necessities of life and not know that God&#8217;s judgment will come upon them by Christ&#8217;s coming. The believers, however, should soberly know that Christ is coming to execute God&#8217;s judgment upon this corrupted world. Furthermore, as verses 40 and 41 indicate, while the worldly people are befuddled by material things, with no sense of the coming judgment, some of the sober and watchful believers will be taken away. This should be a sign of Christ&#8217;s coming to the befuddled and senseless people. The Lord Jesus will come secretly as a thief to those who love Him (v. 43) and will take them away as His treasures.<p>In 25:1-30 the Lord continues His prophecy concerning the church with a parable for watchfulness (vv. 1-13) and a parable for faithfulness (vv. 14-30). Whereas the oil in the parable of the virgins signifies the Spirit of God, the talents in verse 15 signify spiritual gifts (Eph. 4:8; Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 12:4; 1 Pet. 4:10; 2 Tim. 1:6). For life we need oil, the Spirit of God, even His fullness, that we may be enabled to live the virgin life for the Lord&#8217;s testimony. For service, for work, we need the talent, the spiritual gift that we may be equipped as a good slave for the Lord&#8217;s accomplishment. The fullness of the Spirit in life is for us to use the spiritual gift in service, and the spiritual gift in service matches the fullness of the Spirit in life that we may be a perfect member of Christ.<p>Matthew 25:19 says, &#8220;After a long time the lord of those slaves comes and settles accounts with them.&#8221; This &#8220;long time&#8221; signifies the entire church age, and &#8220;comes&#8221; signifies Christ&#8217;s coming to the air (1 Thes. 4:16) in His parousia. &#8220;Settles accounts&#8221; signifies the Lord&#8217;s judgment at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10), where the believers&#8217; life, conduct, and work will be judged for reward or punishment (1 Cor. 4:5; Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 3:13-15).<p>Finally, in 25:31-46 Christ prophesies of His coming in relation to the nations. Verse 31 says, &#8220;When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He shall sit on His throne of glory.&#8221; This refers to the open aspect of Christ&#8217;s coming. It will be the continuation of His coming mentioned in 24:30.<p>Matthew 25:32 continues, &#8220;All the nations shall be gathered before Him, and He shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.&#8221; &#8220;All the nations&#8221; refer to all the Gentiles who will be left at Christ&#8217;s coming back to the earth after He destroys those Gentiles who follow Antichrist at Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16; 19:11-15, 19-21). They will all be gathered and judged at Christ&#8217;s throne of glory. This will be Christ&#8217;s judgment on the living before the millennium (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1), differing from His judgment on the dead at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:1-15). Christ&#8217;s judgment of the living Gentiles will occur after His judgment on the believers at His judgment seat in the air. After the judgment at Christ&#8217;s throne of glory, the sheep will be transferred into the millennium to be the people under the kingly ruling of Christ and the overcomers (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4-6) and under the priestly ministry of the saved Jews (Zech. 8:20-23). The &#8220;goats&#8221; will perish in the lake of fire (v. 41).<h2 class=head2>24. Establishing His Table for the Believers to Remember Him</h2><p>At the end of His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus established His table for the believers to remember Him (Matt. 26:26-28). &#8220;As they were eating, Jesus took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body&#8221; (v. 26). The bread of the Lord&#8217;s table is a symbol signifying the Lord&#8217;s body broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it. By participating in this life we become the mystical body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27), which is also signified by the bread of the table (1 Cor. 10:17). Hence, by partaking of this bread we have the fellowship of the body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:16).<p>In Matthew 26:27 the Lord Jesus took the cup, gave thanks, gave it to the disciples, and said, &#8220;Drink of it, all of you.&#8221; The cup is related to the Lord&#8217;s blood, which has redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God and back to God&#8217;s full blessing. Concerning the Lord&#8217;s table (1 Cor. 10:21), the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God&#8217;s blessing. Hence, it is called the cup of blessing (1 Cor. 10:16). In this cup are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion (Psa. 16:5). In Adam our portion was the cup of God&#8217;s wrath (Rev. 14:10). Christ has drunk that cup for us (John 18:11), and His blood has constituted the cup of salvation for us (Psa. 116:13), the cup that runs over (Psa. 23:5). By partaking of this cup we also have the fellowship of the blood of Christ (1 Cor. 10:16).<p>In Matthew 26:28 the Lord goes on to say, &#8220;For this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.&#8221; The &#8220;fruit of the vine&#8221; (v. 29) within the cup of the Lord&#8217;s table is also a symbol, signifying the Lord&#8217;s blood shed on the cross for our sins. His blood was required by God&#8217;s righteousness for the forgiveness of our sins (Heb. 9:22). The Lord&#8217;s blood, having satisfied God&#8217;s righteousness, enacted the new covenant. In this new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings. When this new covenant is given to us, it is a cup (Luke 22:20), a portion for us. The Lord shed the blood. God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion. The blood is the price Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed God made to us, and the cup is the portion we receive from God.<h2 class=head2>25. Laying Down His Soul Life for His Sheep</h2><p>In John 10:10 and 11 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.&#8221; In these verses two different Greek words are used for life. In verse 10 the Greek word is zoe, which is the word used in the New Testament for the eternal, divine life. In verse 11 the Greek word is psuche, the same word for soul, which means the soulish life, that is, the human life. These verses indicate that the Lord Jesus has two kinds of lives. As a man He has the psuche life, the human life, and as God He has the zoe life, the divine life. He laid down His soul life, His human life, to accomplish redemption for His sheep so that they may share His divine life, the eternal life.<p>The Lord&#8217;s divine life could not be slain. What He laid down and what was slain in His crucifixion was His human life, His soul life. In order to be our Savior, He, as a man, laid down His human life to accomplish redemption for us so that we may receive the divine life. He laid down His soul life in order that we, after being redeemed, may receive eternal life.<h2 class=head2>26. Replacing All the Offerings</h2><p>When Christ was dying on the cross, He replaced all the offerings (Heb. 10:5-9). The various offerings in the Old Testament are types, prefigures, of Christ. God&#8217;s unique will was to send Christ to replace all these offerings. This He did when He offered up Himself once for all (Heb. 10:10). This surely was a great work.<p>From the time of man&#8217;s fall, lambs, sheep, calves, and bulls were used by God&#8217;s chosen people as types pointing to Christ, the real Lamb foreordained by God (John 1:29; 1 Pet. 1:19-20). In the fullness of time (Gal. 4:4) God sent forth the Son to come in incarnation to take a human body (Heb. 10:5) that He might be offered to God on the cross (Heb. 9:14; 10:12) to do the will of God (Heb. 10:7). God&#8217;s will was that Christ replace all the offerings, which were types, with Himself in His humanity as the unique offering for the sanctification of God&#8217;s chosen people (Heb. 10:9-10). Therefore, as the conclusion of His earthly ministry Christ accomplished the great work of replacing all the offerings with Himself.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVENTY</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(8)</h1><p>In this message we shall begin to consider Christ&#8217;s work in His death.<h2 class=head1>E. IN HIS DEATH</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Giving Himself for the Believers That He Might Redeem Them and Purify to Himself a People for His Own Possession as His Peculiar Treasure</h2><p>In His death Christ gave Himself for the believers that He might redeem them and purify to Himself a people for His own possession as His peculiar treasure. Ephesians 5:2 says that Christ loved us and &#8220;gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.&#8221; In the Bible there is a difference between an offering and a sacrifice. An offering is for fellowship with God, whereas a sacrifice is for redemption from sin. Christ gave Himself up for us both as an offering to have fellowship with God and as a sacrifice to redeem us from sin. In loving us Christ gave Himself up for us. It was for us, but it was a sweet-smelling savor to God.<p>In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.&#8221; Whereas the title &#8220;Christ&#8221; mainly denotes Christ&#8217;s mission to carry out God&#8217;s plan, &#8220;the Son of God&#8221; denotes Christ&#8217;s person to impart God&#8217;s life into us. The Son of God loved us and purposely gave Himself for us that He might impart the divine life into us. As Paul wrote this verse, he was filled with appreciation of the Lord Jesus. This was the reason at the end of the verse he spoke of Christ&#8217;s loving him and of having given Himself for him.<p>In Titus 2:14 Paul says that Christ &#8220;gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify to Himself a people for His own possession, zealous of good works.&#8221; The words &#8220;for us&#8221; here mean on our behalf. They do not mean instead of us. To redeem means to buy with a price (1 Cor. 6:20; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; 1 Tim. 2:6). Christ gave Himself for us not only that He might redeem us from all lawlessness but also purify to Himself a people for His own possession. A people for His own possession or a peculiar people is an expression borrowed from the Old Testament (Deut. 7:6; 14:2; 26:18) and denotes a people privately possessed by God as His peculiar treasure (Exo. 19:5), His own possession (1 Pet. 2:9).<h2 class=head2>2. Giving Himself for the Church</h2><p>Ephesians 5:25 tells us that Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. Christ&#8217;s loving the church and giving Himself up for her was for redemption and for the impartation of life. According to John 19:34, blood and water came out of the Lord&#8217;s pierced side. The blood was for redemption, and the water was for the impartation of life so that the church might come into existence. In Ephesians 5:25 we have the church coming into existence through Christ&#8217;s loving her and giving Himself up for her.<h2 class=head2>3. Giving His Physical Body for the Believers That They May Become Members of His Mystical Body</h2><p>Luke 22:19 says, &#8220;Having taken a loaf, when He had given thanks, He broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is given for you.&#8221; This loaf is a symbol signifying Christ&#8217;s physical body broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it. By participating in this life we become the mystical Body of Christ (Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:27). The words &#8220;for you&#8221; in Luke 22:19 indicate that the body here denotes Christ&#8217;s physical body. His physical body is for us, whereas the mystical Body of Christ is for Him. The physical body of Jesus which was crucified is for us, and the mystical Body of Christ is for Him.<p>The physical body of Jesus was given on the cross to accomplish redemption for us. But that body has nothing to do with God&#8217;s present administration. However, the mystical Body of Christ is absolutely related to God&#8217;s administration. Apart from the mystical Body of Christ, God has no means to carry out His administration. Redemption has been fully accomplished by the offering of the physical body of Jesus on the cross. But Christ today has a mystical Body, and this Body is for the carrying out of God&#8217;s administration. In order that we may become members of this mystical Body Christ gave His physical body for us on the cross.<p>Having seen that Christ gave Himself for the believers and for the church and that He gave His physical body for the believers so that they may become members of His mystical Body, we need to consider how Christ gave Himself for us. This giving, of course, was accomplished on the cross. The four Gospels indicate clearly that the Lord Jesus was on the cross for six hours, from nine o&#8217;clock in the morning until three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. The Lord&#8217;s giving of Himself, therefore, took six hours. Before His crucifixion, the Lord Jesus made the long journey from Galilee to Jerusalem for the purpose of presenting Himself to God. The presenting was to God, and the giving was for us.<p>Christ&#8217;s giving Himself for us on the cross was a very difficult task. It required the Lord Jesus to pass through man&#8217;s cruel treatment. During the first three hours the Lord was on the cross, He was persecuted by both the Jews and the Romans. All that they did to Him was part of the process through which the Lord Jesus gave Himself for us. Without the Jewish and Roman persecutors, He could not have given Himself for us. He could not have given His physical body for us so that we may become the members of His mystical Body. We need to be impressed that Christ&#8217;s giving Himself for us involves hard work carried out through a long process of suffering. If the Jews and the Romans had not persecuted Him, He could not have been crucified. After the Jews and Romans persecuted Him, the Jews mocked Him, and the soldiers robbed Him of His garments. Whatever the Jews and Romans did to Him was part of the procedure of His giving of Himself for us.<p>After the Lord Jesus was persecuted by men, He was judged by God. Matthew 27:45 says, &#8220;From the sixth hour darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.&#8221; The sixth hour is our twelve noon, and the ninth hour is our three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. We have seen that during the first three hours of His crucifixion, Christ was persecuted by men for doing God&#8217;s will. In the last three hours He was judged by God for the accomplishment of our redemption. It was during this time that God counted Him as our suffering Substitute for sin (Isa. 53:10). Hence, darkness came over all the land because our sin and sins and all negative things were being dealt with. God put all our sins, iniquities, and transgressions upon the Lord Jesus. If God had not put our sins upon Him, the Lord Jesus could not have given Himself for us to bear our sins. Therefore, man did his part by putting the Lord Jesus on the cross and persecuting Him. Then God came in to do His part by putting all our sins, iniquities, and transgressions upon the Lord Jesus and judging Him as our Substitute for our redemption. This also was part of the process the Lord passed through to give Himself for us.<p>Christ&#8217;s giving Himself for us was not a simple matter that happened quickly. On the contrary, it was a complicated matter that took six hours and required the Lord to pass through a long process. In order for Christ to complete His giving of Himself for us, it was necessary for man to do his part and for God to do His part. On the cross the Lord passed through the process to give Himself for us individually as believers and corporately as the church and in particular to give His physical body for us so that we may become members of His mystical Body.<h2 class=head2>4. Pouring Out His Blood for the New Covenant and for the Forgiveness of the Believers&#8217; Sins</h2><p>As part of His work in His death Christ poured out His blood for the new covenant and for the forgiveness of the believers&#8217; sins. In Luke 22:20 the Lord says, &#8220;This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is being poured out for you.&#8221; God made a covenant with redeemed Israel in Exodus 24:3-8 (Heb. 9:18-21), which became the old testament, as a base for Him to deal with His redeemed people in the dispensation of law. Christ came to accomplish God&#8217;s eternal redemption for God&#8217;s chosen people by His death, according to God&#8217;s will (Heb. 10:7, 9-10), and with His blood instituted a new covenant, a better covenant (Heb. 8:6-13), which became the new testament after His resurrection (Heb. 9:16-17), as a base for God to be one with His redeemed and regenerated people in the dispensation of grace. This new covenant replaced the old covenant and simultaneously changed God&#8217;s old dispensation to His new dispensation. The Lord Jesus wanted His disciples to know this and live a life based on it and according to it after His resurrection.<p>In Matthew 26:28 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s blood was required by God&#8217;s righteousness for the forgiveness of our sins. Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sin (Heb. 9:22). Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God&#8217;s righteousness so that the new covenant may be enacted. But Christ&#8217;s blood was poured out for the forgiveness of sins, and the new covenant has been enacted with His blood. The blood of the Lord Jesus has made a complete redemption for us so that all our sins may be forgiven. His blood has redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God and to God&#8217;s full blessing. The Lord&#8217;s blood, having satisfied God&#8217;s righteousness, enacted the new covenant. In this new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings. Therefore, in His work Christ poured out His blood so that the new covenant may be enacted and the believers&#8217; sins may be forgiven.<p>In one of his hymns Charles Wesley speaks of Christ&#8217;s five bleeding wounds received on Calvary. Four of these wounds were the wounds in His hands and feet received when He was nailed to the cross, and the fifth wound was the wound in His side. The first four bleeding wounds were a matter of persecution, but the fifth wound was a matter of redemption.<p>Luke 22:20 and Matthew 26:28 both indicate that Christ&#8217;s blood was poured out. Of course, this blood was poured out by the Lord Jesus Himself. However, we may think that it was the piercing of the Lord&#8217;s side by the soldiers that caused His blood to pour out. From the human point of view, the Roman soldiers pierced the Lord&#8217;s side, and His blood came out. But from Christ&#8217;s point of view, He poured out His blood for redemption. The pouring out of the Lord&#8217;s blood spoken of in Luke 22:20 and Matthew 26:28 refers to the blood that poured out of His side, not to the blood that issued from the wounds in His hands and feet. The latter was related to persecution, and the former, to redemption.<p>Often we speak of the shedding of Christ&#8217;s blood on the cross. The Lord Jesus, however, said that His blood was poured out. He poured out His blood not for the suffering of persecution but for the accomplishing of redemption.<p>It may seem that the Roman soldiers took the initiative to pierce the Lord&#8217;s side to cause His blood to come out. Actually, the Lord Jesus took the initiative to pour out His blood. If the pouring out of the Lord&#8217;s blood had resulted from the piercing by the soldiers, it might only have been for the suffering of persecution. But according to the Lord&#8217;s own word, the pouring out of His blood was for redemption. There is a great difference between these two things. If the pouring out of Christ&#8217;s blood was a matter of His being pierced by the soldiers, then this would have been a work accomplished by the soldiers. But the pouring out of Christ&#8217;s blood was not the work of Roman soldiers. In the sight of God this was Christ&#8217;s work in His death. The Lord did a great work when He poured out His blood for us. This did not take place during the first three hours of His crucifixion when He was persecuted by man. Rather, it happened during the last three hours when He was working to accomplish redemption for us. Yes, Christ&#8217;s pouring out of His blood took place through the piercing by the soldiers. But the pouring out of His blood for our redemption was actually Christ&#8217;s own work.<h2 class=head2>5. Giving His Life a Ransom for Many</h2><p>In His death the Lord Jesus worked to give His life a ransom for many. &#8220;The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve and to give His life a ransom for many&#8221; (Matt. 20:28). In His humanity the Lord served sinners even with His life, that is, with His soulish life. In John 10:11 the Lord says in a clear but general way that He would lay down His life. But in Matthew 20:28 He says definitely that He gives His life a ransom for many. The Lord&#8217;s soulish life was the ransom, the price, He paid for many.<p>The Lord Jesus gave His soul a ransom for many when He died on the cross. During the last three hours the Lord Jesus was on the cross, God put our sins upon Him, regarding Him as the unique sinner, even as sin itself. As a result, God forsook Christ economically, leaving Him alone under His judgment. Therefore, Christ&#8217;s giving His human life as a ransom for us took place under the process of God&#8217;s judgment. While He was being judged by God for us, He gave His soul life as a ransom, as a payment, for us. This payment required a procedure that lasted at least three hours.<p>It is a great matter that on the cross the Lord Jesus paid the price for us, giving His soul life as a ransom. Because God is a God of law, He must do everything legally. Even in forgiving us, in writing off our debt, He must act legally. Furthermore, God&#8217;s enemy Satan is always watchful to see if God will act righteously. If God were to do anything in an unrighteous way, Satan would immediately protest. Therefore, with respect to Christ&#8217;s giving Himself as a ransom for many in payment of our debt, God could not do anything lawlessly. On the contrary, He had to do everything according to His nature and His way. Christ paid the price for us by doing a great work according to God&#8217;s nature, justice, and requirements and under the watching of the enemy, Satan. On the one hand, God forsook Christ economically. On the other hand, God was waiting and watching to see how Christ as our Substitute would pay the debt for us. This was the reason that the time of God&#8217;s judgment of Christ as our Substitute lasted three hours. For Christ to pay off our debt it was necessary for Him to pass through a process that went on for three hours. From this we see that Christ did a great work in giving Himself as a ransom to pay off our debt before God.<h2 class=head2>6. Offering Himself as a Sacrifice for Sins</h2><p>In His death Christ offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins. Hebrews 10:12 says, &#8220;This One, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God.&#8221; The priests in the old covenant stood daily (v. 11) and offered the same sacrifices again and again, because what they offered could not take away sins. Their standing was a sign that the taking away of sins had not been accomplished. It was Christ&#8217;s offering of Himself that has accomplished the taking away of sins. Whereas the old covenant priests stood daily offering the same sacrifices again and again, Christ has put away sin by offering Himself to God as the unique sacrifice for sin. His sitting in heaven is a sign and proof that the taking away of sins has been accomplished (Heb. 1:3). He no longer needs to do anything for sin, for He has done it once for all.<p>Hebrews 9:26 says, &#8220;Now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin by His sacrifice.&#8221; Here the consummation of the ages means the end of the Old Testament age, whereas the consummation of the age in Matthew 28:20 indicates the close of the church age. Christ was foreordained for us before the foundation of the world (1 Pet. 1:20), and He was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). Actually, His being slain took place once for all at the consummation of the ages, when He offered Himself to God for the putting away of sin.<p>More than nineteen centuries ago, Christ put away sin. Before He accomplished this, the priests offered the sin offering day after day. But that was not the actual putting away of sin; it was only a type, a picture. The real putting away of sin was accomplished once for all by Christ on the cross when He offered Himself as a sacrifice for sins.<p>Hebrews 9:14 tells us that Christ offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit. On the cross Christ offered Himself to God in a human body (Heb. 10:5, 10), which body is a matter of time. But He did this through the eternal Spirit, who is of eternity, without any limit of time. His offering of Himself was once for all (Heb. 7:27), and the redemption accomplished through His death is eternal (Heb. 9:12), having an eternal effect.<p>Christ&#8217;s offering Himself as a sacrifice for sin involves His being the sin offering. During the last three hours He was on the cross, He was in the sight of God the unique sinner offering Himself as a sin offering. This work was accomplished once for all, and it is eternally effective.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(9)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of Christ&#8217;s work in His death.<h2 class=head2>7. Offering Himself as a Propitiation for Our Sins</h2><p>First John 2:2 says that Christ is a propitiation concerning our sins, and 4:10 says that God sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins. The Greek word for &#8220;propitiation&#8221; in these verses, hilasmos, means &#8220;that which propitiates,&#8221; that is, a propitiatory sacrifice. Hence, 1 John 2:2 and 4:10 indicate that the Lord Jesus is the propitiatory sacrifice for our sins. Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins (Heb. 9:28), not only for our redemption but also for God&#8217;s satisfaction. Through His vicarious death and in Him as our Substitute, God is satisfied and appeased. Hence, Christ is the propitiation between God and us.<p>Hebrews 2:17 reveals that Christ has made propitiation for our sins. Here the Greek word rendered &#8220;to make propitiation&#8221; is hilaskomai, which means to appease, to reconcile one by satisfying the other&#8217;s demands, that is, to propitiate. Hence, in Hebrews 2:17 the Lord Jesus makes propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God&#8217;s righteous demands on us. Through His work on the cross Christ made propitiation for our sins. This means that He appeased God for us. By appeasing God&#8217;s righteousness and all His requirements on us, Christ has settled every problem between us and God.<h2 class=head2>8. As the Lamb of God Taking Away the Sin of the World</h2><p>John 1:29 speaks of Christ as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. This means that Christ as the Lamb of God takes away sin from the human race. The phrase &#8220;of the world&#8221; in this verse actually means from mankind. Through Satan sin entered into man, for Satan injected sin, his poisonous nature, into the human race. But the Lamb of God has come to take away this sin from the world, from mankind.<p>Christ as the Lamb of God is the representation and fulfillment of all the offerings to accomplish God&#8217;s full redemption. Christ is the totality of all the offerings. He is not only the sin offering but also the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the wave offering, the heave offering, the free will offering, and the drink offering. With Christ as all the offerings we have God&#8217;s full salvation and full redemption. Through Christ as the Lamb of God representing all the offerings we may enter into God and participate in the divine life and nature (John 3:14-15; 2 Pet. 1:4). Because of Christ as the Lamb of God, we are well able, even enabled, to enter into God. We have full redemption in Christ, and thereby we are enabled to enter into God to enjoy all He is.<p>During the last three hours the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He bore the load of the sin of mankind. As the Lamb of God He took away the sin of mankind as a whole. A great deal of work was required to remove the sin of the world. The Lord did not simply command the sin to go away. On the contrary, while on the cross He worked to pay our debt, to appease God, and to remove sin. As He was working to take away the sin of the world, He was forsaken by God economically. The Lord as the Lamb of God did a great work in His death to take away the sin of mankind.<h2 class=head2>9. Bearing the Sins of Many</h2><p>On the cross Christ bore our sins. According to Isaiah 53:6, when Christ was on the cross God took all our sins and put them upon this Lamb of God. Hebrews 9:28 says that Christ has been &#8220;once offered to bear the sins of many.&#8221; Christ died once to bear our sins, and He suffered the judgment for us on the cross (Isa. 53:5, 11).<p>First Peter 2:24 tells us that Christ &#8220;carried up our sins in His body onto the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness.&#8221; The tree in this verse denotes the cross made of wood, a Roman instrument of capital punishment for the execution of malefactors, as prophesied in the Old Testament (Deut. 21:23; Gal. 3:13). Sins here, as in Hebrews 9:28, refer to sins we commit in our outward conduct, whereas sin in John 1:29 refers to the sin that is in our nature by birth. Christ died for our sins, carrying up our sins onto the cross, that we might be forgiven by God.<p>Literally, in 1 Peter 2:24 &#8220;having died to sins&#8221; means being away from sins; hence, having died to them. In the death of Christ we have died to sins (Rom. 6:8, 10-11, 18) so that we might live to righteousness. This living to righteousness is in the resurrection of Christ (Eph. 2:6; John 14:19; 2 Tim. 2:11).<p>When Christ carried up our sins onto the cross and died, that death accomplished many things. The death of Christ terminated us, and this termination can keep us away from sin. Through Christ&#8217;s death we can be kept away from sins so that we may live to righteousness. As fallen human beings, we were dead and full of sin. But Christ put our sins upon Himself and carried them up onto the tree, the cross, where He suffered God&#8217;s righteous judgment for all our sins. Christ&#8217;s death on the cross was a bruise, and that bruise, that death, has healed our death. Now we have become alive. On the one hand, Christ&#8217;s bruise that heals us keeps us away from sins through His death; on the other hand, this healing enlivens us so that we may live to righteousness.<p>The subjective aspect of the cross of Christ continues in our experience today by the Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is working within us continually to carry out the subjective aspect of Christ&#8217;s cross in our living. Christ&#8217;s death has drawn a separating line between us and sins. Now through His death we are being kept away from sins. This is the objective cross becoming subjective to us in our experience through the working of the life-giving Spirit within us. When we call on the name of the Lord and have fellowship with Him, the life-giving Spirit operates within us. Spontaneously we experience the subjective working of the cross to make a separation between us and sins so that we automatically live to righteousness.<h2 class=head2>10. Becoming a Curse on Our Behalf and Redeeming Us out of the Curse of the Law</h2><p>In His work on the cross Christ became a curse on our behalf and redeemed us out of the curse of the law. &#8220;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, Cursed is everyone hanging on a tree&#8221; (Gal. 3:13). Christ as our Substitute on the cross not only bore the curse for us but also became a curse for us. The curse of the law issued from the sin of man (Gen. 3:17). When Christ took away our sin on the cross, He redeemed us out of the curse. Because the problem of sin has been solved, the problem of the curse has been solved as well.<p>As descendants of Adam, all sinners are under the curse. In Romans 5 we see that Adam brought us all under the curse. However, the curse was not made official until the law was given. Now the law declares that all the fallen descendants of Adam are under the curse. Whereas the law condemns us and makes the curse official, Christ through His crucifixion has redeemed us out of the curse of the law. On the cross He was even made a curse for us. Therefore, the curse that came in through Adam&#8217;s fall has been dealt with by Christ&#8217;s redemption.<p>The origin of the curse is man&#8217;s sin. God brought in the curse after Adam&#8217;s sin, saying, &#8220;Cursed is the ground for thy sake&#8221; (Gen. 3:17). The sign of the curse is thorns. For this reason, after Adam&#8217;s sin, the earth brought forth thorns. Furthermore, the curse is carried out through the law. This means that the law administers the curse. Therefore, the curse is related to the law of God; it is the demand of the righteous God upon sinners.<p>When Christ bore our sins, He also took our curse. The crown of thorns indicates this (John 19:2, 5). Since thorns are a sign of the curse, Christ&#8217;s wearing a crown of thorns indicates that He took our curse on the cross. Because Christ was cursed in our place, the demand of the law was fulfilled, and He could redeem us from the curse of the law.<p>Not only did Christ redeem us out from the curse; He even became a curse on our behalf. This indicates that He was absolutely abandoned by God. God forsook Christ economically and also considered Him a curse. On the cross Christ accomplished the great work of bringing us out from the curse of the law, working to bear our sins and to remove the curse.<h2 class=head2>11. Suffering the Shame of Death</h2><p>The book of Hebrews reveals that Christ suffered the shame of death (2:9; 12:2; 13:12b). When Christ tasted death on behalf of everything, He suffered and endured shame. To be shamed and insulted is to suffer in such a way as to be tired out. The suffering of insulting shame always wears people out. On the cross Christ suffered the greatest shame-the shame of death. This also was part of His work.<h2 class=head2>12. Being Made Sin for the Believers</h2><p>In His death Christ not only bore our sins but even became sin for us. &#8220;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:21). This indicates that God made Christ sin for us. Christ did not know sin in an experiential way by contact or personal experience (cf. John 8:46; 1 Pet. 2:22; Heb. 4:15; 7:26). In experience, in direct contact, the Lord Jesus had nothing to do with sin, and He did not know sin. Nevertheless, He became sin and took away the sin of the world so that the problem of sin might be solved.<p>Sin came from Satan as the rebel against God (Isa. 14:12-15), entered into man (Rom. 5:12), and made man not only a sinner but sin itself under God&#8217;s judgment. Hence, when Christ became a man in the flesh (John 1:14), He was made sin (not sinful) on our behalf to be judged by God (Rom. 8:3) that we might become God&#8217;s righteousness in Him. During the last three hours He was on the cross, Christ was made sin in the sight of God. It was during that time that God condemned sin in the flesh. As the One who was made sin for us, Christ as our Substitute was judged by God once for all.<h2 class=head2>13. As a Man in the Flesh Causing Sin to Be Condemned in the Flesh by God</h2><p>In His death Christ as a man in the flesh caused sin to be condemned in the flesh by God. Romans 8:3 says, &#8220;God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&#8221; The flesh is of sin, and the Son of God did indeed become flesh (John 1:14; Heb. 2:14; 1 Tim. 3:16). However, He was only in the likeness of the flesh and had no participation in the sin of the flesh. According to Romans 8:3, God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin so that God might condemn sin in the flesh.<p>Concerning sin, God sent His Son in the likeness, in the form, of the flesh of sin. This indicates that sin dwells in a certain element, and this element is man&#8217;s flesh. Our flesh is thus the habitation of sin. Sin dwells in our flesh. Furthermore, sin has actually become one with our flesh, making our flesh virtually the incarnation of sin. Incarnation refers to one thing which was formerly outside another thing entering into that thing and becoming one with it. One day the Lord Jesus Christ, who is God, was incarnated. In this way man became Christ&#8217;s incarnation. In the same principle, sin has become one with our flesh, making it the incarnation of sin.<p>When God the Father sent God the Son concerning sin and to deal with sin, even to abolish it. He sent Him not in the reality of the flesh of sin but in the likeness, in the appearance, of the flesh of sin. This means that God sent Christ in the likeness of the flesh that had become sin&#8217;s incarnation. In the likeness of the flesh of sin, God sent His Son concerning sin and to deal with it.<p>Romans 8:3 clearly reveals that God has condemned sin in the flesh. In whose flesh did God condemn sin? The answer is that God condemned sin in the flesh of Jesus Christ, the One who was sent in the likeness of the flesh of sin. In this flesh God condemned sin. According to John 1:1 and 14, the Word, which is God, became flesh. In this flesh, the incarnation of the eternal Word, God condemned sin through crucifixion. When the Lord Jesus was crucified in the flesh, God condemned sin in the flesh. Therefore, in the flesh of Jesus Christ and through His work in His death, God condemned sin in the flesh.<p>Christ was a man in the flesh, and He died on the cross as a man in the flesh. As such a man in the flesh, He had only the likeness of the flesh of sin, not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin. There was no sin in His flesh. Christ&#8217;s humanity does not have sin, but nevertheless His humanity was in some way related to sin. Therefore, His dying on the cross as a man in the flesh caused sin to be condemned in the flesh by God. In other words, God condemned indwelling sin through Christ&#8217;s work on the cross. Christ accomplished a work in His death through which God condemned sin in the flesh.<h2 class=head2>14. As the Last Adam Causing the Old Man to Be Crucified</h2><p>In His death on the cross Christ was the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45b) causing the old man to be crucified (Rom. 6:6). Adam, the head of all mankind, made himself with his descendants a fallen man in God&#8217;s old creation through his fall. Christ, as the last Adam, as the conclusion of the old man, brought the old man to the cross to be crucified. When He was crucified, our old man was crucified with Him.<p>Although Christ crucified the old man, He did not do this directly. Rather, He crucified the old man by dying as the last Adam. His crucifixion as the last Adam caused our old man to be crucified. Because the Lord Jesus died as a man in the old creation, our old man was dealt with through His death. Romans 6:6 says, &#8220;Our old man has been crucified with Him.&#8221; Similarly, Galatians 2:20 says, &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ.&#8221; Because the marvelous death of Christ was all-inclusive, it included us. We were put into Christ by God, and we were in Him when He was crucified. Hence, we were included in His all-inclusive eternal death. Galatians 6:14 says that through the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ the world has been crucified to us and we to the world. The world has been crucified to us and we to the world not directly, but through Christ who was crucified.<h2 class=head2>15. As the Firstborn of All Creation Terminating the Old Creation</h2><p>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation. Because He is the Firstborn of all creation, in His death on the cross the Lord Jesus terminated the old creation, dying as the Firstborn of all creation. With respect to His humanity, Christ was the first item of God&#8217;s creation. When He died on the cross, He died as this first item of the old creation. Hence, through His death on the cross the entire old creation was terminated.<p>The redemption accomplished by Christ is not only for man but also for creation. Chapter one of Colossians tells us not only that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation but also that through Christ&#8217;s redemption all the created things in heaven and on earth were reconciled to God (v. 20). Christ&#8217;s redemption is for all things. Hebrews 2:9 says clearly that Christ tasted death not only on behalf of every man but also on behalf of everything.<p>If Christ were only a man and not the Firstborn of all creation, the first item of all the creatures, He could not have accomplished redemption for all the creatures. In the same way that it was necessary for Him to be a man to accomplish redemption for man, it was necessary for Him to be a creature to make a redemption for all the creatures. It was necessary for our Redeemer to be the first item of all creation in order for Him to redeem all creation; therefore, He is in the first place as the Firstborn of all creation. In the same principle, He is the last Adam, the head of all mankind, and as such He is qualified to be the Redeemer of mankind.<h2 class=head2>16. Casting Out the Ruler of This World and Judging His World</h2><p>In His work on the cross Christ also cast out the ruler of this world and judged his world. &#8220;Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out&#8221; (John 12:31). This indicates that Christ&#8217;s work in His death included the casting out of Satan, the ruler of this world. Satan thought that he was wise in having the Lord Jesus crucified. Actually, by doing this Satan caused himself to be cast out. The cross was the way used by God to cast out Satan.<p>The New Testament reveals that Satan has formed an evil, satanic system called the world. Through the world, the satanic cosmos, Satan has systematized fallen mankind under his usurping hand. Satan uses the world to keep people from the purpose of God and to distract them from the enjoyment of God. But this evil world system, the kingdom of darkness, was judged through Christ&#8217;s work on the cross.<p>Because the world system is connected to Satan, when he, the ruler of the world, was judged, the world was judged as well. The ruler of this world was cast out when Satan was cast out by Christ&#8217;s work in His death. Simultaneously, the world system related to Satan was judged.<p>When the Lord Jesus was crucified, the entire old creation and the satanic world were crucified with Him. Hence, the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion was the termination of the satanic world. Therefore, in Galatians 6:14 Paul could declare, &#8220;Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.&#8221;<h2 class=head2>17. As the Brass Serpent Destroying the Devil, Who Had the Might of Death</h2><p>When Christ died on the cross, He died as the brass serpent destroying the Devil, who had the might of death. In John 3:14 He said concerning this, &#8220;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&#8221; Here the Lord Jesus applies to Himself the type of the brass serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness (Num. 21:4-9). When the children of Israel sinned against God, they were bitten by serpents. God told Moses to lift up a brass serpent on their behalf for God&#8217;s judgment so that by looking upon that brass serpent all may live. This is a type. Applying this type to Himself, the Lord Jesus indicated that when He was in the flesh, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3), which likeness was the form of the brass serpent. It had the form of the serpent but not the poison. Christ was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He had no participation in the sin of the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15).<p>The brass serpent in Numbers 21 was a representative of the people bitten by the serpents. In the sight of God, those people had become serpents. For God to forgive them, save them, and recover them, they needed to be judged by God. Nevertheless, they themselves were not judged, but they were judged in and through their representative, which was the serpent made of brass. In the sight of God that serpent lifted up on the pole and judged there was the representative of all those people who had become serpents, but the brass serpent possessed only the form of the serpent and not the poisonous nature of the serpent. Likewise, in His death on the cross the Lord Jesus was crucified as a serpent in form.<p>No doubt, the Lord Jesus was crucified as the brass serpent in order to deal with Satan, the Devil, the old serpent. It was through being crucified as the brass serpent that He crushed the head of the old serpent (Gen. 3:15). In this way the Lord Jesus destroyed the Devil, who had the power of death (Heb. 2:14). In His humanity and through His work in His death Christ has destroyed Satan. Therefore, Christ died not only as the Substitute of fallen men, who had been bitten by the serpent, but also to destroy the Devil.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(10)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of Christ&#8217;s work in His death. Then we shall go on to consider His work in His burial.<h2 class=head2>18. Tasting Death on Behalf of Everything</h2><p>Hebrews 2:9 says that the Lord Jesus tasted death on behalf of everything. He tasted death not only for human beings but also for every creature. This indicates that Christ&#8217;s redemption was accomplished not only for people but for everything created by God. Thus God could reconcile all things to Himself by Him. Colossians 1:20 says that God has reconciled all things to Himself through the death of Christ. This is clearly typified by the redemption of Noah&#8217;s ark, in which not only eight persons but all other living things created by God were saved (Gen. 7:13-23). The ark is a type, a picture, of Christ in this respect. In Hebrews 2:9 we have the profound revelation that Christ tasted death not only for man but also for all other things. Due to the sin of Adam, the head of the old creation, everything is under death. In His work on the cross Christ tasted this death, a death on behalf of everything. This is the reason we say that Christ&#8217;s death was an all-inclusive death.<h2 class=head2>19. Nullifying Death</h2><p>In 2 Timothy 1:10 Paul tells us that through His work in His death Christ nullified death. The Greek word translated &#8220;nullified&#8221; also means make of none effect, bring to naught, do away with, abolish, annul, discard. Through His Devil-destroying death, Christ nullified death, making it of none effect. To nullify death does not mean to remove death but to make it of no effect. Death will not be removed until it is cast into the lake of fire after the millennium (Rev. 20:14). Death will be the last enemy destroyed by the Lord (1 Cor. 15:26). Although death has not yet been removed, it is none the less a fact that it has been nullified through Christ&#8217;s death on the cross.<h2 class=head2>20. Causing the Rulers and Authorities to Be Stripped Off, to Be Made a Display of Openly, and to Be Triumphed Over in the Cross by God</h2><p>Colossians 2:15 says, &#8220;Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it.&#8221; Here we see that in His work on the cross Christ caused the rulers and authorities to be stripped off, to be made a display of openly, and to be triumphed over in the cross by God. The rulers and authorities spoken of in this verse are the angelic rulers and authorities. The Greek word for &#8220;stripping off&#8221; can also be rendered &#8220;putting off.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;make a display&#8221; means show or exhibit in the sense of putting to an open shame. God openly shamed the evil angelic rulers and authorities on the cross and triumphed over them in it. The Greek words translated &#8220;in it&#8221; refer to the cross, but they can also be rendered &#8220;in Him,&#8221; referring to Christ.<p>In a very real sense the cross of Christ is the center of the universe. After God created the heavens, the earth, and billions of items in the universe, an archangel rebelled and many angels followed him. This archangel became Satan, and his followers became the evil rulers, powers, and authorities in the heavenlies. Later, the man created by God fell and became sinful. Eventually, Christ, God incarnate, went to the cross to work for the accomplishment of redemption. While Christ was on the cross, many things took place. At that time the cross was the center of the universe. The Savior, sin, Satan, we, and God were all there. While God was judging sin, the evil rulers and authorities were present and were very active, swarming around the crucified Christ, pressing in very closely. If they had not pressed in closely, God could not have stripped them off. The words &#8220;stripping off&#8221; indicate that the rulers and authorities were very close, as close as our garments are to our body. By stripping off the rulers and authorities God made a display of them openly, putting them to shame and triumphing over them.<p>Colossians 2:15 portrays the warfare that took place at the time of Christ&#8217;s crucifixion. In His crucifixion Christ was working to accomplish redemption, and God the Father was working to judge sin. At the same time the rulers and authorities were busy in the attempt to frustrate the work of God and Christ. The reference to triumph in Colossians 2:15 implies fighting; it indicates that a war was raging. While Christ was working to accomplish redemption, the rulers and authorities came to interfere, pressing in close to Christ. But at that very juncture God stripped them off, triumphed over them, and made a display of them openly, putting them to an open shame. Christ&#8217;s work in His death caused all this to take place.<h2 class=head2>21. Giving Himself for the Believers&#8217; Sins That He Might Rescue Them out of the Present Evil Age</h2><p>Galatians 1:4 says that Christ &#8220;gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father.&#8221; Here we see that in His crucifixion Christ gave Himself for our sins. Apart from Christ&#8217;s death on the cross, there is no way for us to be redeemed from our sins.<p>Although Christ was crucified for our sins, the goal of His crucifixion was to rescue us out of the present evil age. An age is a part of the world as the satanic system. An age refers to a section, an aspect, the present or modern appearance, of the system of Satan, which is used by him to usurp and occupy people and keep them away from God and His purpose. The world system of Satan has different ages, different sections. We may regard each decade as a distinct age or section of Satan&#8217;s world system. The present age is the present section of Satan&#8217;s cosmos, his world system. Whereas sins are devilish, the present age is satanic. As the Devil God&#8217;s enemy is involved with sins, and as Satan he is involved with the evil age. God&#8217;s enemy is subtle, lurking behind sins and the evil age. Apart from the crucifixion of Christ, we have no way to deal with sins, behind which the Devil hides, or the evil age, behind which Satan hides. Christ was crucified for our sins so that He might rescue us from this evil age. This indicates that only Christ can save us from the Devil and Satan. Both sins and the evil age have been dealt with by Christ crucified. He gave Himself for us on the cross according to the will of God. He died for our sins so that we might be delivered from the present evil age. Therefore, if we would be delivered from this evil age, our sins must be dealt with. If we, through the preaching of the gospel, help others to have the forgiveness of sins, they will begin to realize that they need to be rescued from the present evil age.<p>Literally, the Greek word translated &#8220;rescue&#8221; in Galatians 1:4 means to pluck out, to draw out, to extricate. The present evil age in this verse, according to the context of the book, refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, which at Paul&#8217;s time was the Jewish religion. This is confirmed by Galatians 6:14 and 15, where circumcision is considered part of the world-the religious world to which the Apostle Paul is crucified. Here Paul emphasizes that the purpose of Christ&#8217;s giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us out, from the Jewish religion, the present evil age. This is to release God&#8217;s chosen people from the custody of the law (Gal. 3:23), to bring them out of the sheepfold (John 10:1, 3), according to the will of God.<p>In Galatians 1:4 Paul points out that in order to rescue us from the present evil religious age, Christ gave Himself for our sins. This indicates that Christ died in order to rescue us from Judaism. In John 10 we see that Christ as the good Shepherd entered into the fold in order to bring His sheep out of the fold and into the pasture. The fold in John 10 signifies the law, or Judaism as a religion of the law, in which God&#8217;s chosen people were kept and guarded in custody until Christ came. Eventually Christ came as the Shepherd to bring the sheep out of the fold to the pasture, where they may feed on His riches. Although Christ came to release the sheep from the fold, the Judaizers crucified Him. Christ died on the cross not only for the sins of His sheep but also to bring them out of the fold.<p>In Galatians 1 we see that Christ gave Himself for our sins for the purpose of rescuing us out of religion, out of the present evil age. The Judaizers crucified Him. But through His death on the cross the Lord Jesus gave Himself for our sins in order to rescue us from the religious fold. The principle is the same both with the believers in Paul&#8217;s time and with us today.<h2 class=head2>22. As Our Peace Abolishing the Law of the Commandments in Ordinances- Breaking Down the Middle Wall of Partition, the Enmity</h2><p>In Ephesians 2:14 and 15 we see that on the cross Christ died as our peace, abolishing the law of commandments in ordinances, breaking down the middle wall of partition, the enmity: &#8220;He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances.&#8221; Here we see that Christ died on the cross to abolish all the ordinances among mankind. Due to man&#8217;s fall, among mankind there are many ordinances, many customs, habits, ways to live, and ways to worship. All these differences among peoples have divided, scattered, and confused mankind. Therefore, among the human race there is no peace. Christ died on the cross to abolish all these ordinances. In particular, He died to take away the partition between the Jews and the Gentiles. Not only was there a partition between Jews and Gentiles; there were also partitions between every nationality and race. Without the removal of these partitions, there would not be a way for us to be one in the Lord Jesus as His Body.<p>All the ordinances were abolished by Christ on the cross. When He was crucified, His death abolished, annulled, the different ordinances of human life and religion. Furthermore, the differences among the races and the differences of social rank have been abolished by the death of Christ.<p>Ephesians 2:14 says, &#8220;He Himself is our peace.&#8221; The word &#8220;our&#8221; refers to both Jewish and Gentile believers. Through the blood of Christ we have been brought near both to God and to God&#8217;s people. Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers, is Himself our peace, our harmony, in that He made both one. Because of the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles. Through Christ&#8217;s redemption, this separation has been removed. Now the two are one in the redeeming Christ, who is the bond of oneness.<p>Ephesians 2:14 speaks of the middle wall of partition. This middle wall of partition is the law of the commandments in ordinances, which was given because of man&#8217;s flesh. The first of these ordinances was circumcision to cut off man&#8217;s flesh. Circumcision became the middle wall of partition because it made the main distinction between the Jews, the circumcision, and the Gentiles, the uncircumcision. Thus, the middle wall of partition, this distinction, became the enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles.<p>In the law of Moses there were two kinds of commandments: moral commandments, such as the commandments concerning stealing and the honoring of parents, and ritual commandments, such as the commandment concerning the keeping of the Sabbath. The commandments regarding circumcision and the eating regulations were ritual commandments, not moral commandments. The moral commandments will never be abolished, not in this age nor in the millennium nor in eternity. The ritual commandments, on the contrary, are not permanent. By the middle wall of partition Paul meant the law of commandments in ordinances, the ritual commandments related to circumcision, the Sabbath, and diet. The law of ritual commandments was a middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles. Actually, any ordinance or ritual is a middle wall of partition.<p>Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ abolished &#8220;in His flesh&#8221; the law of commandments in ordinances. Because mankind became flesh (Gen. 6:3) and was thus kept from God and His purpose, God ordained His chosen people to be circumcised from the flesh. This ordinance was given because of man&#8217;s flesh. It was in the flesh that Christ was crucified. When He was crucified, His flesh, which was typified by the separating veil in the temple, was rent (Heb. 10:20). By breaking down the middle wall of partition on the cross, Christ has made peace.<p>Colossians 2:14 says, &#8220;Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;wiping out&#8221; can also be translated blotting out, obliterating, erasing, or annulling (a decree of law). The Greek word rendered &#8220;handwriting&#8221; denotes a legal document, a bond. Here it refers to the written law. The ordinances, or decrees, refer to the ceremonial law with its rituals, the forms or ways of living and worship. These ordinances God has taken out of the way by nailing them to the cross of Christ. This is to abolish the law of the commandments in ordinances.<h2 class=head2>23. As a Grain of Wheat Falling into Death for the Release of the Divine Life</h2><p>In His work on the cross the Lord Jesus died as a grain of wheat falling into death for the release of the divine life. &#8220;Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit&#8221; (John 12:24). Christ&#8217;s all-inclusive death released the divine life that was within Him. As a grain of wheat He died to release the divine life and to enliven God&#8217;s redeemed ones, to produce many grains that can be blended together in a loaf to be offered to God. This loaf is the church, the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17).<p>The Lord Jesus fell into the ground and died so that His divine element, His divine life, might be released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many believers in resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3), just as a grain of wheat has its life element released by falling into the ground and growing up out of the ground to bear much fruit, that is, to bring forth many grains. The Lord Jesus, as a grain of wheat falling into the ground, lost His soulish life through death so that He might release His divine life in resurrection to the many grains.<p>On the negative side, Christ&#8217;s all-inclusive death has solved the problems of sins, sin, the old man, the old creation, Satan, the world, and the ordinances. On the positive side, Christ&#8217;s death has released the divine life from within Him. He was a grain of wheat, and there was no other way for that grain to increase except to fall into the ground and die. This is the way to have the multiplication of life. Therefore, in His death Christ was sown into the earth as a grain of wheat to produce a multiplication through the release of the divine life.<p>Furthermore, it was by dying to release the divine life that the Lord Jesus was glorified and glorified the Father. In John 12:23 the Lord said, &#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified,&#8221; and in verse 28 He prayed, &#8220;Father, glorify Your name.&#8221; The Lord was glorified through death and resurrection because it was through death and resurrection that His divine element was released and manifested. God the Father was glorified by the Son&#8217;s being glorified. When the Son&#8217;s divine element was released and manifested through His death and resurrection, the Father&#8217;s divine life was released and manifested. Thus, the Father was glorified in the Son&#8217;s glorification through His death and resurrection. The death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus glorified God the Father because Christ&#8217;s death released the divine element from within Him. This element was confined in His flesh, just as the life element of a grain of wheat is confined within its shell. In order for the life element of a grain of wheat to be glorified, the grain must die so that the element within it can be released. It is the same with the divine element within the Lord Jesus.<p>To glorify the name of the Father is to cause the Father&#8217;s element to be manifested. This element, which is the eternal life, was in the incarnated Son. The shell of the Son&#8217;s incarnation, His flesh, had to be broken through death so that the Father&#8217;s element might be released and manifested in resurrection, just as the life element of a grain of wheat is released by its shell being broken and manifested by its blossom. This is the glorification of God the Father in the Son&#8217;s glorification through His dying as a grain of wheat to release the divine life.<h2 class=head2>24. Flowing Out the Water from His Body Signifying the Release of His Divine Life for the Producing of the Church</h2><p>Finally, in His work on the cross the Lord Jesus flowed out water from His body, signifying the release of His divine life for the producing of the church. &#8220;One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water&#8221; (John 19:34). Here we see that two substances came out of the Lord&#8217;s pierced side: blood and water. Blood is for redemption, dealing with sins (John 1:29; Heb. 9:22) for the purchase of the church (Acts 20:28), and water is for imparting life, dealing with death (John 12:24; 3:14-15) for the producing of the church (Eph. 5:26-31). We were sinners fallen away from God, but through the blood of Jesus we have been brought back. Moreover, we were dead. Therefore, the Lord released His divine life to enliven us, to make us alive. In this way the problem of death is solved, and the church as the new creation is produced. On the one hand, the church was bought by the Lord&#8217;s blood; on the other hand, the church was produced by His divine life, which He released and imparted to us.<p>On the negative side, Christ&#8217;s death takes away our sins; on the positive side, it releases the divine life. Hence, His death has two aspects-the redemptive aspect and the life-releasing aspect. The redemptive aspect is for the life-releasing aspect, which is even more wonderful than the redemptive aspect. God&#8217;s purpose is that redemption be followed by the imparting of life, for God&#8217;s intention is to dispense Himself into us as life. Therefore, redemption prepares the way for the release of the divine life so that this life may be dispensed into us for the producing of the church.<p>The water that flowed out of the Lord&#8217;s side signifies the life-releasing aspect of His death. This is typified by the water flowing out of the smitten rock (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4). This aspect of Christ&#8217;s death is the life-releasing, life-propagating, life-multiplying death, the generating and reproducing death. When the Lord Jesus said that He was a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die so that many grains might be produced (John 12:24), He was referring to the life-releasing aspect of His death. The dying of this grain of wheat was not for redemption; it was for releasing the divine life so that it may be imparted into the many grains. On the negative side, Christ&#8217;s death dealt with our sins; on the positive side, it released the divine life. As we believe in Him today, our sins are forgiven through His redemptive death, and eternal life is imparted into us through His life-releasing death.<p>Through His death on the cross Christ&#8217;s divine life was released. Hence, His death was a life-releasing death. Because His divine life has not only been released out of Him but also imparted into us, His death was a life-imparting death. On His side it was the life-releasing death; on our side it is the life-imparting death. Moreover, it is the life-propagating death, for by it life is spread in many directions. Furthermore, it is the life-multiplying death, causing the multiplication of life. It is also the life-producing death, for the one grain has been reproduced in the many grains. We need to be deeply impressed with the wonderful life-releasing aspect of Christ&#8217;s all-inclusive death.<h2 class=head1>F. IN HIS BURIAL</h2><p>Now we need to consider Christ&#8217;s work in His burial. After He was buried, Christ went in His living spirit to the spirits in prison (the rebellious angels) to proclaim God&#8217;s victory, through His incarnation in Christ and Christ&#8217;s death in the flesh, over Satan&#8217;s scheme to derange the divine plan.<p>According to 1 Peter 3:18, Christ was &#8220;put to death in flesh, but made alive in spirit.&#8221; This is not the Holy Spirit but the spirit which is Christ&#8217;s spiritual nature (Mark 2:8; Luke 23:46). The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh which He received through incarnation, not in His spirit. Instead of dying at the cross when His flesh did, Christ&#8217;s spirit was made alive, enlivened with new power of life, so that in this empowered spirit Christ made a proclamation to the fallen angels after His death in the flesh and before His resurrection.<p>We should not interpret &#8220;made alive in spirit&#8221; as referring to Christ&#8217;s resurrection. There is no mention of Christ&#8217;s resurrection in 1 Peter 3:18. Rather, this verse indicates that when Christ was buried in the tomb, in His empowered spirit, He went before His resurrection, to the abyss to proclaim God&#8217;s victory to the rebellious angels.<p>First Peter 3:19 says, &#8220;In which also having gone to the spirits in prison, He proclaimed.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;in which&#8221; refers to the spirit in verse 18, indicating and proving that in this spirit Christ, after dying in His flesh, was still active. In particular, in His enlivened spirit He made a proclamation to the spirits in prison. Throughout the centuries great teachers of different schools have had varying interpretations concerning the spirits in prison. The most acceptable according to the Scriptures is as follows. The spirits here do not refer to the disembodied spirits of dead human beings held in Hades, but to the angels (angels are spirits-Heb. 1:14) who fell through disobedience at Noah&#8217;s time (1 Pet. 3:20 and Life-study of Genesis Message 27, pp. 363-364) and are imprisoned in pits of gloom for the judgment of the great day (2 Pet. 2:4-5; Jude 6). After His death in the flesh, Christ in His living spirit went (probably to the abyss-Rom. 10:7) to these rebellious angels to proclaim, perhaps, God&#8217;s victory through His incarnation in Christ and Christ&#8217;s death in the flesh, over Satan&#8217;s scheme to derange the divine plan.<p>The prison in 1 Peter 3:19 refers to Tartarus, the deep and gloomy pits (2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 6) where the fallen angels are kept. The word &#8220;proclaimed&#8221; does not indicate the preaching of the good news but the proclaiming of the triumphant victory. This proclamation was made to &#8220;those once disobedient&#8221; (1 Pet. 3:20). These are angelic beings, not human beings, and therefore are different from the eight souls also spoken of in verse 20. Thus, the spirits in prison do not refer to the disembodied spirits of dead human beings held in Hades, but to angels who fell through their disobedience at the time of Noah. Those angels left their own place, came down to earth, and used human bodies to commit fornication with the daughters of men, polluting the human race and producing giants (Gen. 6:4). It was to these angels, to these spirits, that Christ made a proclamation of victory.<p>Christ died on the cross for our redemption. But although He was put to death in His body, He was enlivened and empowered in His spirit, even before the resurrection. In this enlivened and empowered spirit He went to proclaim to the rebellious angels God&#8217;s victory over Satan, their leader. Hence, Christ&#8217;s death not only accomplished redemption for us, but also gained the victory over Satan and his followers. After His death and before His resurrection, Christ proclaimed to Satan&#8217;s followers God&#8217;s victory over the Devil through the crucifixion of Christ. This was Christ&#8217;s work in His burial.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(11)</h1><p>We come in this message to Christ&#8217;s work in His resurrection.<h2 class=head1>G. IN HIS RESURRECTION</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Rising from the Dead to Be the Firstfruit of Resurrection Offered to God for His Satisfaction</h2><p>In His resurrection Christ accomplished the work of rising from the dead to be the firstfruit of resurrection offered to God for His satisfaction. Acts 10:41 says, &#8220;He rose from among the dead,&#8221; and Romans 14:9 says, &#8220;Christ died and lived again.&#8221; Regarding the Lord Jesus as a man, the New Testament tells us that God raised Him from the dead (Rom. 8:11). Regarding Him as God, it tells us that He Himself rose from the dead. This indicates His dual status, human and divine. The Lord Jesus is God and also resurrection (John 1:1; 11:25), possessing the indestructible life (Heb. 7:16). Because He is the ever-living One, death was not able to hold Him. He delivered Himself to death, but death could not detain Him. Rather, death was defeated by Him, and He rose up from it.<p>In John 20:17 the Lord Jesus said to Mary, &#8220;Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father.&#8221; In this verse the Lord refers to His ascending to the Father. On the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus ascended to the Father. This was a secret ascension forty days prior to His public ascension before the eyes of His disciples (Acts 1:9-11). On the day of resurrection, early in the morning, He ascended to satisfy the Father. The freshness of His resurrection was first for the Father&#8217;s enjoyment, as the firstfruit of the harvest was, in type, brought first to God.<p>We see the type in Leviticus 23:10 and 11 and Exodus 23:19a. Leviticus 23:10 and 11 say, &#8220;Ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.&#8221; This sheaf of the firstfruits is a type of Christ in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:20, 23). Christ resurrected exactly on the day after the Sabbath, that is, on the first day of the week. The Sabbath is the seventh day, and the morrow after the Sabbath is the first day of the week. The firstfruits of the harvest were offered to God on the day after the Sabbath, on the first day of the following week. On the first day of the week Christ, the firstfruit of resurrection, resurrected from the dead to offer Himself to God. This is not only a type but also a prophecy which was fulfilled in John 20.<p>Exodus 23:19a says, &#8220;The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God.&#8221; According to this verse, the first of the firstfruits was to be brought into the house of God. This typifies Christ as the firstfruit of resurrection brought to God&#8217;s dwelling place for His satisfaction. Therefore, one aspect of Christ&#8217;s work in His resurrection was to rise up to be the firstfruit presented to the Father for His satisfaction.<h2 class=head2>2. Causing His Believers to Be Regenerated by God</h2><p>In His work in His resurrection Christ caused His believers to be regenerated by God. God &#8220;has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead&#8221; (1 Pet. 1:3). Regeneration, like redemption and justification, is an aspect of God&#8217;s full salvation. Redemption and justification solve our problem with God and reconcile us to God. Regeneration enlivens us with God&#8217;s life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God. Hence, regeneration issues and results in a living hope. Such regeneration takes place through the resurrection of Christ from among the dead. When Christ was resurrected, we, His believers, were all included in Him. Thus, we were resurrected with Him (Eph. 2:6). In His resurrection He imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and nature. This is the basic factor of our regeneration.<p>To be regenerated is to receive another life, the divine life, in addition to the human life. We all received the human life from our parents. But because of God&#8217;s choosing, the Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying, and Christ&#8217;s redeeming, God has begotten us, has regenerated us. As a result, we have had a second birth. Through regeneration God the Father imparts the divine life into us. Therefore, the first birth was the birth of our human life, and the second birth, the birth of the divine life. We all have been born of the divine life. This is what it means to be regenerated.<p>Through Christ&#8217;s resurrection we have been regenerated by God unto a living hope. The Greek word translated &#8220;unto&#8221; also means issuing in, resulting in, with a view to. God the Father has regenerated us with a view to a living hope, the hope that every part of our being and everything related to us will be enlivened. Everything related to an unsaved person is dead. But with one who has been regenerated by God with the divine life there is the hope that everything will be enlivened and thus become living.<p>In Adam we all died, but through the instrumentality of Christ&#8217;s resurrection God has regenerated us, has enlivened us. We were born with Christ in His resurrection. Dean Alford says, &#8220;The resurrection of Christ, bringing in life and the gift of the life-giving Spirit, is that which potentiates the new birth into a living hope.&#8221; The resurrection of Christ potentiates our regeneration into a living hope. When we were regenerated, the resurrected Christ entered into us. He is not only the living One-He is also the resurrected One. Now He is the life within us that potentiates the new birth and causes every part of our being to become living.<h2 class=head2>3. Rising on the First Day of the Week to Germinate the New Creation</h2><p>Another aspect of Christ&#8217;s work in His resurrection is His rising on the first day of the week to germinate the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). John 20:1 says, &#8220;On the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene came early to the tomb while it was yet dark, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.&#8221; It is significant that the Lord Jesus was resurrected not on the last day of the week but on the first day of the week. The first day denotes a new beginning. In the Bible the first day of the week is also called the eighth day (John 20:26). After a week of seven days, we have the eighth day, which is the first day of the week. The Lord Jesus died during one week, and He resurrected at the beginning of another week. Therefore, the resurrection of the Lord Jesus was a new start opening the way to a new generation and a new age.<p>In the old creation there were seven days. God created for six days and rested on the seventh. These seven days were the generation of the old creation. By the resurrection of the Lord Jesus another generation was newly started. In other words, by the resurrection of Christ the old creation has passed away and a new creation has begun. The old generation is over, and the new generation has started. Therefore, the first day of the week signifies the beginning of a new creation, a new generation, and a new age.<p>The fact that Christ arose on the first day of the week indicates that the entire universe has a new beginning in Christ&#8217;s resurrection. His resurrection ushered in a new period, a new age. In the sight of God the entire old creation was crucified with Christ and buried with Him. Then on the first day of the week there was a new beginning with Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<p>Whereas the Lord&#8217;s death was the termination of the old creation, His resurrection was the germination of the new creation. For this reason, instead of keeping the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, we meet on the Lord&#8217;s Day, the first day of the week. This means that in resurrection we are in the eighth day, or the first day of the week. Elsewhere, the New Testament calls the first day of the week the Lord&#8217;s day (Rev. 1:10), for it was on this day that the Lord Jesus was resurrected to become the living Lord and to usher in a new beginning in resurrection.<p>When Christ resurrected to germinate a new creation, He left the old creation, signified by the linen cloths and the handkerchief (John 20:5-7), in the tomb. Before the body of Jesus was buried, it was bound in linen (John 19:40). This indicates that He went into the tomb with something of the old creation, signifying that the old creation was brought into the tomb by His burial. All the things which were cast off from the Lord&#8217;s resurrected body and left in His tomb signify the old creation. Christ was crucified with the old creation and buried with it. But He resurrected from within it, leaving it in the tomb and becoming the firstfruit of the new creation in resurrection.<p>The old creation does not have the divine life and nature. But the new creation, which consists of believers born again of God (John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet. 1:4), does have the divine life and nature. Therefore, we are a new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15), not according to the old nature of flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life.<p>When the old creation is germinated with the divine life, it becomes the new creation. We, the believers in Christ, who have been germinated through His resurrection, are now the new creation. The old creation does not have God in it, but the new creation begins by God coming into us in the way of germination. This germination is the impartation of the divine life into the believers. Through this impartation of the divine life we were regenerated. Therefore, germination is the impartation of the divine life into the believers for their regeneration to make them a new creation.<h2 class=head2>4. Producing Many Grains for His Multiplication and Glorification</h2><p>In His resurrection the Lord Jesus produced many grains for His multiplication and glorification. As a grain of wheat (John 12:24) He had a human &#8220;shell,&#8221; by which He was restricted and under which His divine element was covered and concealed. When He died, the divine life was released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many grains in His resurrection. This means that in resurrection He did a work to have Himself multiplied from one grain to many grains. By being multiplied in this way He was glorified. His multiplication was His glorification.<p>Jesus Christ is God incarnate. When He was incarnated, He entered into humanity and put on humanity as a shell. As a result, Christ&#8217;s divine life and nature were confined and concealed within the shell of His humanity. Through incarnation He became a seed that needed to bear fruit. This fruit-bearing was to be Christ&#8217;s glorification. The only way for a grain of wheat to be glorified is for it to fall into the ground and die and then grow up. In this way the life within the seed is released to bring forth much fruit, and this fruit-bearing is glorification. By going through this process of death and resurrection the Lord Jesus terminated the old creation and germinated the new creation in resurrection. In this resurrection He produced many grains. Those who believe in Christ are these many grains. Therefore, the Lord Jesus fell into the ground as a grain of wheat and rose up in resurrection to have Himself released and expressed in the many grains. This is what it means for the Lord Jesus to be glorified.<p>In John 12:23 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.&#8221; Here the Lord was concerned for His glorification. In verse 24 He went on to explain what this glorification is: &#8220;Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; The Lord Jesus was glorified by dying as a grain of wheat and then growing up in resurrection to produce many grains. He fell into the ground and died so that His divine element, His divine life, might be released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many believers in resurrection, just as a grain of wheat has its life element released by falling into the ground and growing up out of the ground to bear much fruit, that is, to bring forth many grains. Therefore, glorification is a matter of dying and rising so that many grains may be brought forth. This indicates that Christ&#8217;s glorification was His multiplication, and His multiplication was His glorification. The Lord Jesus was glorified in the producing of many grains, which are for the building up of His Body. Hence, for Christ to be glorified is for Him to bring forth many grains as His multiplication in resurrection.<p>In John 13:31 and 32 the Lord Jesus spoke again concerning His glorification: &#8220;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.&#8221; Here we see that the Father is glorified in the Son. This means that when the Son is glorified, the Father is glorified as well. In John 12:28 the Lord Jesus prayed, &#8220;Father, glorify Your name.&#8221; To glorify the name of the Father is to cause the Father&#8217;s element to be expressed. The Father&#8217;s element, the divine element, which is eternal life, was in the incarnated Son. It was necessary for the shell of the Son&#8217;s humanity to be broken through death so that the Father&#8217;s element might be released and expressed in resurrection. This is the glorification of God the Father in the Son. The Father is glorified in the Son&#8217;s glorification because in this glorification the Father is expressed.<p>After speaking the words recorded in John 13:31 and 32, the Lord Jesus went on to give the lengthy message recorded in John 14 through 16. Actually, this message began in 13:31, which speaks of the glorification of the Son. Both the Lord&#8217;s message in chapters fourteen through sixteen and His prayer in chapter seventeen are on the subject of glorification. In His message He spoke concerning glorification, and in His prayer He prayed concerning glorification.<p>In John 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, &#8220;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.&#8221; Here we see glorification as the subject of the Lord&#8217;s prayer. He was God incarnate, and His flesh was a tabernacle for God&#8217;s dwelling on earth (John 1:14). His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God&#8217;s shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle. Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory (Matt. 17:1-4). But it was concealed again in His flesh. Before the prayer recorded in John 17, the Lord indicated that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him. The Lord Jesus knew that He would pass through death so that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken to release His divine element, His divine life. He would also resurrect so that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed. Then His divine being, both divinity and humanity, would be glorified. In this way the Father would be glorified in Him.<p>In John 17:5 the Lord Jesus went on to say in His prayer, &#8220;Now, glorify Me with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.&#8221; Before His incarnation Christ as the only begotten Son of God was with the Father in glory and enjoyed this glory with the Father. But when He put on flesh through incarnation, this glory was concealed in His flesh. His humanity was a shell that covered and confined the divine life and nature, along with the divine glory, that were within Him. The divine glory, the expression of the divine life and nature, was therefore confined and concealed within the Lord&#8217;s humanity. Outwardly, He appeared to be a Jew, even a despised Nazarene. That was the appearance of the shell of Christ&#8217;s humanity. But within this shell the divine life, nature, and glory were concealed. Through His death and by His work in His resurrection, Christ released the divine life from within Him to produce many grains for His glorification. This is a crucial aspect of Christ&#8217;s work in His resurrection.<h2 class=head2>5. Bringing Forth the Corporate Child- the Corporate New Man- Including Himself as God&#8217;s Firstborn Son and His Many Brothers as God&#8217;s Many Sons</h2><p>By His work in His resurrection Christ brought forth the corporate child-the corporate new man-including Himself as God&#8217;s firstborn Son and His many brothers as God&#8217;s many sons (John 16:19-22; Rom. 8:29). In John 16:20 and 21 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. When a woman gives birth she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.&#8221; Here the Lord Jesus indicates that the disciples were like a woman travailing in birth, and He was the child to be brought forth in His resurrection (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5; Rom. 1:4). Actually, the man in John 16:21 includes Christ and all believers. According to Acts 13:33, the Lord Jesus was begotten in resurrection to be the Son of God with respect to His humanity. The Lord&#8217;s resurrection, therefore, was a birth. This means that when Christ was resurrected, He was born.<p>We may wonder why it was necessary for Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, to be born in resurrection as the Son of God. In eternity Christ was the only begotten Son of God. Then in His incarnation He was born of Mary, and in resurrection He had another birth. When Christ was born of Mary, He was born as a man, and His humanity had nothing to do with God&#8217;s sonship. Strictly speaking, the human part of Jesus was not the Son of God but the Son of Man. Therefore, it was necessary for the human part of the Lord Jesus to be born into the divine sonship through resurrection. Hence, Christ&#8217;s resurrection was a new birth for Him. He was already the only begotten Son of God before His incarnation. Then through incarnation He was born to be a man. Now in resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God.<p>Furthermore, Christ&#8217;s being the firstborn Son of God implies that He has many brothers and that He is the Firstborn among these brothers (Rom. 8:29). The birth that took place through Christ&#8217;s resurrection involved the birth not only of an individual but of a group, a group that includes the firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God. This indicates that through one birth, one delivery, many sons were brought forth. According to God&#8217;s view, the divine view, all His chosen people were born together with Christ in His resurrection. This resurrection was the birth of a corporate child.<p>We should not think that Christ as the firstborn Son was born in His resurrection and that all His brothers, the many sons of God, have been born gradually during the centuries following His resurrection. No, we were all born to be sons of God in the resurrection of Christ. This is the reason 1 Peter 1:3 says that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Christ. When Christ was resurrected, we were regenerated. All the believers, including the early apostles and those who will be the last to believe in the Lord Jesus, were regenerated together. We all were brought forth by means of a single universal delivery. In Christ&#8217;s resurrection millions of God&#8217;s sons were born. Therefore, the Lord&#8217;s word in John 16:21 concerning the corporate man born in resurrection includes Himself as the firstborn Son and all the believers as the many sons.<p>The corporate man brought forth by Christ&#8217;s work in His resurrection is the new man spoken of in Ephesians 2:15: &#8220;Having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man.&#8221; This new man includes Christ as the Head and all the believers as the Body. The Head is the firstborn Son of God, and the Body is a composition of all the many sons of God, the many brothers of the Lord. This new man, this child, was brought forth through Christ&#8217;s work in resurrection.<h2 class=head2>6. Rebuilding God&#8217;s Temple, Making It a Corporate One</h2><p>Christ in His resurrection rebuilt God&#8217;s temple, making it a corporate one (John 2:19-22; 1 Cor. 3:16-17). In John 2:19 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&#8221; In speaking this word, He was referring to &#8220;the temple of His body&#8221; (v. 21). The physical body of Jesus was destroyed on the cross. When Christ became flesh, He took on a physical body. John 1:14 clearly indicates that the Lord&#8217;s physical body was a tabernacle. According to John 2, His physical body was also the temple. When the Lord Jesus was in the flesh, His body was the tabernacle and temple of God. Both the tabernacle and the temple are God&#8217;s dwelling place. Realizing that the physical body of Jesus was God&#8217;s dwelling place on earth, Satan did his best to destroy this body, and he did destroy it on the cross. In a sense, Satan destroyed Christ&#8217;s physical body. In another sense, the Lord Jesus gave up His body to death.<p>After Satan destroyed Christ&#8217;s physical body on the cross, His body was put into a tomb and rested there. When Christ arose, He Himself raised up His dead and buried body. The body of Jesus that was destroyed on the cross was small and weak; the Body of Christ in resurrection is vast and powerful. After the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, His Body, that is, the temple, was reared up on a much larger scale. The body the enemy destroyed by crucifixion was merely the body of Jesus. What was raised up by the Lord in resurrection was not only His own body but everyone who is joined to Him by faith (1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6).<p>Christ&#8217;s word in John 2:19 was actually a prophecy concerning His death and resurrection. In this prophecy the Lord Jesus indicated that He would rebuild the temple, God&#8217;s house, in resurrection. This rebuilding of the house of God in resurrection was to be an enlargement of God&#8217;s house. This is proved by the fact that not only was Christ Himself resurrected but that all the believers, who constitute His Body, were resurrected with Him. This resurrection was both a rebuilding and a birth. With respect to the house of God it was a rebuilding in resurrection. With respect to the new man it was a birth in resurrection. By this we see that, in one sense, the resurrection of Christ was a birth and, in another sense, it was a rebuilding.<p>In John 14:2 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.&#8221; This word is a fulfillment of the prophecy given by the Lord in 2:19. In chapter two of John the Lord Jesus prophesied that He would rebuild the temple, the house of God, in resurrection and that He would build it in an enlarged way. If we did not have chapter fourteen we would not see where the prophecy given in chapter two is fulfilled. John 14:2 is the fulfillment of 2:19.<p>We need to realize that the rebuilding of the destroyed temple has already been accomplished. In Christ&#8217;s resurrection we all have been resurrected. As we have seen, we were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3). This means that in God&#8217;s view, according to His accomplishment in His economy, the Body of Christ has already been built. The tense of certain verbs in the book of Revelation indicates this. For example, the Apostle John does not say that the New Jerusalem will come; he tells us that he saw the New Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God (Rev. 21:2). Approximately nineteen hundred years ago, John saw the New Jerusalem. This indicates that, according to God&#8217;s way of seeing, the Body of Christ, the enlarged temple, has already been built up through Christ&#8217;s work in His resurrection.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(12)</h1><p>In this message we shall first cover more aspects of Christ&#8217;s work in His resurrection. Then we shall go on to consider His work in His ascension.<h2 class=head2>7. Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>In resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). This was not an easy matter; on the contrary, it was a great work. In order to accomplish the work of becoming the life-giving Spirit, the Lord Jesus had to pass through death and then, in resurrection, do certain wonderful things. Now He is the Spirit who gives life, the Spirit who imparts life to us, the Spirit who dispenses Himself as life into the believers.<p>Christ&#8217;s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit. He was Christ in the flesh, but He has been transfigured into the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit. Resurrection was His actual transfiguration. Before His death and resurrection He was transfigured on the Mount of Transfiguration. However, that transfiguration was temporary. His actual transfiguration was His resurrection, for in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.<p>If we are lacking in revelation, in proper spiritual vision, we may not realize that in resurrection Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit. To deny that Christ is the life-giving Spirit is equal to denying the reality of resurrection. The life-giving Spirit is the life pulse of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. If Christ had merely been resurrected with a body and had not become the life-giving Spirit, His resurrection would not mean nearly as much to us. It would simply be an objective fact unrelated to life. It could then be compared to the resurrection of Lazarus. The resurrection of Lazarus was merely an act of resurrection; it did not produce anything related to life. But Christ&#8217;s resurrection is a matter absolutely related to life, for in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who imparts life.<p>Resurrection was not merely an objective act accomplished by Christ. It is very much related to us subjectively. Through incarnation Christ became a man. Incarnation was much more than an objective fact; it was a process that brought God into humanity. The principle is the same with the process of resurrection. Resurrection was not merely an act in itself; it was a process to bring forth the life-giving Spirit. Through the process of resurrection Christ, who ended the old creation, became the life-giving Spirit, the germinating element of the new creation.<p>Few Christians have seen that Christ in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit. Andrew Murray, however, understood something concerning this and wrote about it in his masterpiece, The Spirit of Christ, in the chapter entitled, &#8220;The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus.&#8221; The Spirit of the glorified Jesus is actually the Lord Jesus Himself in resurrection and in glory. When He entered into resurrection, He became the Spirit who gives life. This life-giving Spirit is the essence to germinate a new creation. The germinating element of the new creation is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit.<p>First Corinthians 15:45 is a great verse because it implies the new creation with the Spirit as the center. This Spirit is nothing less than Christ, the Triune God. Actually, the life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God. Christ passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now in resurrection He is the life essence to germinate the new creation. We have become the new creation germinated by Christ as the life-giving Spirit. The highest definition of resurrection is that it is the process by which Christ, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit.<p>When Christ came through incarnation, He came with the Father and by the Spirit. After coming in incarnation, He took a further step to pass through death and enter into resurrection. This is the process that we call Christ&#8217;s transfiguration from the flesh into the Spirit. By going through this process of transfiguration, the Lord Jesus, who came in incarnation with the Father and by the Spirit, became the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. Therefore, Christ&#8217;s resurrection was His transfiguration-the transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit to enter into His believers. This transfiguration included a number of elements: humanity, human living, Christ&#8217;s all-inclusive death, and His life-imparting resurrection. All these elements have been brought into the all- inclusive life-giving Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>8. Breathing Himself as the Holy Spirit into the Disciples</h2><p>In resurrection Christ came to the disciples and breathed Himself as the Holy Spirit into them. &#8220;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (John 20:22). We may not think that this was a work, but it was a great work accomplished by Christ in His resurrection. The Holy Spirit is the realization of the resurrected Christ, and the Lord breathed this realization into the disciples.<p>Before His death and resurrection, the Lord Jesus could not be in His disciples. He could only be among them. In order to come into them, He needed to do the marvelous work of becoming the life-giving Spirit and of breathing this Spirit into the disciples. This great work was accomplished by Christ in His resurrection.<p>The Gospel of John reveals that Christ is the Word, the eternal God (1:1), who passed through a long process eventually to become the breath, the pneuma, that He might enter into the believers. For the accomplishment of God&#8217;s eternal purpose, He took two steps. First, He took the step of incarnation to become a man in the flesh (1:14), to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption for man (1:29), to declare God to man (1:18), and to manifest the Father to His believers (14:9-11). Second, He took the step of death and resurrection to be transfigured into the Spirit that He might impart Himself into His believers as their life and their everything for the building of His Body, the church, the habitation of God, to express the Triune God for eternity. The Gospel of John clearly reveals that Christ became flesh to be the Lamb of God and that in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Thus, in the evening of the day of His resurrection He came and breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples.<p>The Holy Spirit in John 20:22 is the Spirit expected in 7:39 and promised in 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; and 16:7-8, 13. This indicates that the Lord&#8217;s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. In chapter fourteen the Lord Jesus promised that He would ask the Father to send another Comforter (v. 16). Then in chapter twenty He brought to His disciples this other Comforter, the Spirit of reality. Now the Spirit of reality has come to the disciples to be within them; now the disciples know that the Lord Jesus is in the Father and that the Father is in the Lord; and now they are in the Lord and the Lord is in them. They realize that they are now one with the Triune God. Therefore, all that the Lord Jesus spoke to them in chapters fourteen through sixteen is fulfilled at this very moment. This fulfillment is that the Lord Jesus went by death and resurrection and came to the disciples as the Spirit, coming as another Comforter to be their reality that they might be one with the Triune God.<p>As the falling into the ground to die and the growing out of the ground transforms a grain of wheat into another new and lively form, so the death and resurrection of Christ transfigured Him from the flesh into the Spirit. As the last Adam in the flesh He became the life-giving Spirit through the process of death and resurrection. As He is the embodiment of the Father, so the Spirit is the realization, the reality, of Him. It is as the Spirit that He was breathed into the disciples. It is as the Spirit that He was received into His believers and flowed out of them as rivers of living water (7:38-39). It is as the Spirit that through His death and resurrection He came back to the disciples, entered into them as their Comforter, and began to abide in them (14:16-17). It is as the Spirit that He can live in the disciples and they can live by Him and with Him (14:19). It is as the Spirit that He can abide in the disciples and they can abide in Him (14:20; 15:4-5). It is as the Spirit that He can come with the Father to the one who loves Him and make an abode with him (14:23). It is as the Spirit that He can make all that He is and has to be fully realized by the disciples (16:13-16). It is as the Spirit that He came to meet with His brothers as the church to declare the Father&#8217;s name to them and to praise Him in their midst (Heb. 2:11-12). And it is as the Spirit that He can send His disciples with His commission, with Himself as life and everything to them, in the same way that the Father sent Him (John 20:21).<h2 class=head2>9. Staying with the Disciples and Teaching Them the Things concerning the Kingdom of God</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus breathed Himself into the disciples, He stayed with them economically for forty days. Acts 1:3 says, &#8220;To whom also He presented Himself alive after His suffering by many convincing proofs, through a period of forty days, appearing to them and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God.&#8221; Christ&#8217;s presenting Himself alive was for the purpose of training the disciples to practice and enjoy His invisible presence. In the Gospel of John there is no word or hint indicating that the Lord Jesus left the disciples after breathing Himself into them. Actually, He stayed with them, although they were unconscious of His presence. The Lord&#8217;s further appearing to them was His manifestation. Before His death, the Lord&#8217;s presence was visible in the flesh. After His resurrection, His presence was invisible in the Spirit. His manifestations, or appearings, after His resurrection were to train the disciples to realize, enjoy, and practice His invisible presence, which is more available, prevailing, precious, rich, and real than His visible presence. Christ&#8217;s invisible presence is just the Spirit in His resurrection whom He breathed into the disciples and who would be with them all the time.<p>After the Lord Jesus breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples, He never left them essentially. However, economically He would appear and then disappear. The Lord appeared and disappeared economically in order to train the disciples. Regarding this, we should not speak of His going and coming but of His appearing and disappearing. The disciples had become accustomed to the visible presence of Christ. For three and a half years He had been with them visibly in the flesh. Suddenly His visible presence was taken away. Then the Lord came back to the disciples to breathe Himself into them. From that time onward His presence with them became invisible. It was no longer a physical presence but a spiritual presence. From the time He breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples on the day of His resurrection, the resurrected Christ dwelt in them. His appearing spoken of in Acts 1:3 does not mean that He ever left the disciples. Rather, it means that He made His presence visible to them, training them to realize and enjoy continually His invisible presence.<p>Although Christ&#8217;s spiritual presence is invisible, it is more real and vital than His visible presence. The Lord&#8217;s visible presence involved the elements of space and time. But with His invisible presence there is neither the element of space nor the element of time. His invisible presence is everywhere. Wherever we are the Lord&#8217;s invisible presence is with us. Actually, His invisible presence is not merely with us-it is within us.<p>The Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples for a period of forty days. In the Bible forty days are a period of trial and testing (Deut. 9:9, 18; 1 Kings 19:8). When the Lord Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil, He fasted forty days and forty nights (Matt. 4:1-2). Also, the children of Israel were tested by God in the wilderness for forty years. Forty, therefore, is the number of testing, proving, trying, educating. In Acts 1 the Lord Jesus appeared and disappeared during a period of forty days in order to train His disciples.<p>During these forty days the Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples concerning the kingdom of God. Although we are not told in Acts what the Lord Jesus spoke concerning the kingdom, we may infer what He said by considering other portions of the Word. In the Gospels the Lord Jesus taught the disciples much concerning the kingdom. It is not likely that during the forty days after His resurrection He gave the disciples something new concerning the kingdom. Rather, He may have repeated what He taught them in the Gospels. When the Lord spoke regarding the kingdom in the Gospels, the disciples were not able to understand what He was teaching them. They did not have the necessary spiritual insight, because the Lord was not yet in them. But in John 20 they received Christ as the life-giving Spirit. As a result, in Acts 1 they were very different, for Christ, the life-giving Spirit, was now within them as their life and person. Because they had the life-giving Spirit within them, they were able to understand Christ&#8217;s speaking concerning the kingdom of God.<p>The kingdom of God is not a kingdom visible to human sight; it is a kingdom of the divine life. The kingdom of God is actually the spreading of Christ as life into His believers to form a realm in which God rules in His life. The kingdom of God is the ruling, the reigning, of God with all its blessing and enjoyment. It is the goal of the gospel of God and of Jesus Christ. To enter into this kingdom, people need to repent of their sins and believe in the gospel (Mark 1:15) so that their sins may be forgiven and that they may be regenerated by God to have the divine life, which matches the divine nature of His kingdom (John 3:3, 5).<p>The kingdom of God is actually Christ Himself (Luke 17:21) as the seed of life sown into His believers, God&#8217;s chosen people (Mark 4:3, 26), and developing into a realm which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life. Regeneration is its entrance (John 3:5), and the growth of the divine life within the believers is its development (2 Pet. 1:3-11). The kingdom of God is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live (Rom. 14:17), and it will develop into the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward (Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5) to the overcoming saints in the millennium. Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God and the eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God&#8217;s eternal life for all God&#8217;s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth.<p>In Acts 1:3 the Lord Jesus must have helped the disciples to have such a proper realization concerning the kingdom of God. The disciples must have begun to see that the kingdom of God is the spreading of Christ as life to His believers, that it is the propagation of Christ as life to form a realm in which God rules in His life. The disciples certainly must have understood that they were now part of the propagation, the spreading, of Christ, and thereby were part of the kingdom of God. Christ&#8217;s teaching the things concerning the kingdom of God was an important aspect of His work in His resurrection.<h2 class=head2>10. Preparing and Charging the Disciples to Preach the Gospel and Disciple the Nations for His Propagation That the Church May Be Produced</h2><p>Finally, in His work in His resurrection Christ prepared and charged the disciples to preach the gospel and disciple the nations for His propagation that the church may be produced. Luke 24:44 and 45 say, &#8220;He said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all the things must be fulfilled which have been written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me. Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures.&#8221; The Law of Moses, the Prophets, and Psalms are the three sections of the entire Old Testament, that is, all the Scriptures (v. 27). The Lord&#8217;s word here unveils that the entire Old Testament was a revelation of Him and that He was its center and content. The fact that He opened the mind of the disciples indicates that in order to understand the Scriptures, our mind needs to be opened by the Lord Spirit through His enlightening (Eph. 1:18).<p>Christ&#8217;s meeting with the disciples in Luke 24 was the right time for Him to commission them to preach the forgiveness of sins. After pointing out that it was necessary that Christ should suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day (v. 46), He told them that &#8220;repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things&#8221; (vv. 47-48). Forgiveness of sins could be proclaimed only after Christ&#8217;s vicarious death for the sinners&#8217; sins had been accomplished and had been verified by His resurrection (cf. Rom. 4:25).<p>To proclaim the forgiveness of sins is to proclaim the jubilee. Luke 4 speaks of the release of the captives. To proclaim the forgiveness of sins is to proclaim the release of captives from slavery and bondage. The first aspect of the jubilee is the forgiveness of sins. According to the following books of the New Testament, the forgiveness of sins ushers the forgiven ones into the riches of the Triune God. Therefore, forgiveness of sins brings us into the enjoyment of the Triune God. This is the jubilee.<p>The Gospel of John emphasizes life for fruit-bearing (John 15:5), whereas the Gospel of Luke stresses forgiveness of sins for proclaiming. To bear fruit in life requires essentially the Spirit of life received through the breathing of the Spirit (John 20:22). To proclaim forgiveness of sins requires economically the Spirit of power received through the baptism in the Spirit (Acts 1:5, 8).<p>In Mark 16:15 the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, &#8220;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation.&#8221; This reveals that the redemption of God accomplished by the Lord Jesus through His death and resurrection is not only for man, the leading one in God&#8217;s creation, but for all the creation. Hence, all things, whether on earth or in the heavens, were reconciled to God, and the gospel should be proclaimed to all creation under heaven (Col. 1:20-23). Based upon this, all the creation expects to be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (Rom. 8:19-22).<p>In Mark 16:16 the Lord Jesus went on to say to the disciples, &#8220;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.&#8221; To believe is to receive the Lord Jesus (John 1:12) not only for forgiveness of sins (Acts 10:43) but also for regeneration (1 Pet. 1:21, 23), so that those who believe may become the children of God (John 1:12-13) and the members of Christ (Eph. 5:30) in an organic union with the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). To be baptized is to affirm this by being buried to terminate the old creation through the death of Christ and by being raised up to be the new creation of God through Christ&#8217;s resurrection. To believe and to be so baptized are two parts of one complete step for receiving the full salvation of God. To be baptized without believing is merely an empty ritual; to believe without being baptized is to be saved only inwardly without an outward affirmation of the inward salvation. These two should go together.<p>Mark 16:16 does not say &#8220;who does not believe and is not baptized shall be condemned.&#8221; This indicates that condemnation is related only to not believing; it is not related to not being baptized. Believing itself is sufficient for one to receive salvation from condemnation; yet it needs baptism as an outward affirmation for the completion of one&#8217;s inward salvation.<p>In Matthew 28:18 the resurrected Christ spoke to His disciples saying, &#8220;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.&#8221; In His divinity as the only begotten Son of God the Lord Jesus had authority over all. However, in His humanity as the Son of Man to be the King of the heavenly kingdom, all authority in heaven and on earth was given to Him after His resurrection.<p>In verse 19 the Lord Jesus continued, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Because all authority had been given to Him, the Lord Jesus sent His disciples to go and disciple all the nations. They go with His authority. To disciple the nations is to cause the heathen to become kingdom people for the establishment of His kingdom, which is the church on earth today.<p>Notice that the Lord Jesus did not charge the disciples merely to preach the gospel but to disciple the nations. The difference between preaching the gospel and discipling the nations is that to preach the gospel is simply to bring sinners to salvation, but to disciple the nations is to cause the Gentiles to become kingdom people. The disciples were sent by the Lord not only to bring others to salvation but also to disciple the nations.<p>In verse 19 the Lord speaks of baptizing the nations into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Baptism is to bring repentant people out of their old state into a new one by terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ that they may become kingdom people. After the Lord Jesus accomplished His ministry on earth, passed through the process of death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God. This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water and the invisible aspect by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38, 41; 10:44-48). The visible aspect is the expression, the testimony, of the invisible aspect, whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect. Without the invisible aspect by the Spirit, the visible aspect by water is vain, and without the visible aspect by water, the invisible aspect by the Spirit is abstract and impractical. Both are needed. Not long after the Lord Jesus charged the disciples with this baptism, He baptized them and the entire church in the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13) on the day of Pentecost (Acts 1:5; 2:4) and in the house of Cornelius (Acts 11:15-17). Then, based upon this, the disciples baptized the new converts (Acts 2:38), not only visibly into water but also invisibly into the death of Christ (Rom. 6:3-4), into Christ Himself (Gal. 3:27), into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13). The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered a tomb to terminate the history of the baptized ones. Because the death of Christ is included in Christ, because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and because the Triune God is one with the Body of Christ, to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to do one thing: on the negative side to terminate their old life and on the positive side to germinate them with a new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ. Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord Jesus here is to baptize people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens.<p>In Matthew 28:20 the Lord Jesus concludes, &#8220;Behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.&#8221; Christ is Emmanuel, God with us (Matt. 1:23). Here He promised to be with us in His resurrection with all authority all the days until the consummation of the age, that is, until the end of this age.<h2 class=head1>H. IN HIS ASCENSION</h2><p>In His work in His ascension Christ led captive those taken captive. &#8220;Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive&#8221; (Eph. 4:8). The word &#8220;height&#8221; in the quotation from Psalm 68:18 refers to Mount Zion (Psa. 68:15-16), symbolizing the third heaven where God dwells (1 Kings 8:30). Psalm 68 implies that it was in the ark that God ascended to Mount Zion after the ark had led the way to victory. Verse 1 of Psalm 68 is a quotation of Numbers 10:35. This indicates that the background of Psalm 68 is God&#8217;s move in the tabernacle with the ark as its center. The ark was a clear type of Christ. Wherever the ark went the victory was won. Eventually the ark ascended triumphantly to the top of Mount Zion. This portrays how Christ has won the victory and has ascended triumphantly to the heavens.<p>The word &#8220;those&#8221; in Ephesians 4:8 refers to the redeemed saints who had been taken captive by Satan before they were saved by Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection. In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan&#8217;s captivity and took them to Himself. This indicates that Christ has conquered and overcome Satan, who had captured them by sin and death.<p>The Amplified New Testament renders &#8220;He led a train of vanquished foes&#8221; for &#8220;He led captive those taken captive.&#8221; &#8220;Vanquished foes&#8221; may refer to Satan, to his angels, and to us the sinners, also indicating Christ&#8217;s victory over Satan, sin, and death. In His ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes as captives from a war for a celebration of Christ&#8217;s victory.<p>In Adam we all were captured by Satan. This means that through Adam&#8217;s fall we became Satan&#8217;s captives. Eventually, the Lord Jesus came to undo Satan&#8217;s work, defeating him by His death and capturing Satan&#8217;s captives through His death and resurrection. Then in His ascension He led these captives to the heavens as a train, a procession. This indicates that, as believers in Christ, we are in the heavens, for when Christ ascended to the heavens we were in that train of captives led by Him to the highest place in the universe.<p>This is confirmed by Ephesians 2:6, which says that God &#8220;raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.&#8221; God not only raised us up from the position of death but also seated us in the heavenlies, in the highest place in the universe. The heavenlies are the high position into which we have been saved in Christ. The word &#8220;heavenlies&#8221; refers not only to a place but also to an atmosphere with a certain nature and characteristic. God&#8217;s salvation has brought us into a heavenly place and into a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly characteristic.<p>It was in Christ that God seated us all together, once for all, in the heavenlies. This was accomplished when Christ ascended to the heavens, and it was supplied to us by the Spirit of Christ when we believed in Him. Today we realize and experience this reality in our spirit through faith in the accomplished fact.<p>Through His death and resurrection Christ released us from the usurping hand of Satan. Then He brought us to the heavens where we are now sitting, not as captives but as sons of God and members of Christ. Christ&#8217;s unique work in His ascension has brought us all to the highest place in the universe.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(13)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover a number of aspects of Christ&#8217;s work in His heavenly ministry.<h2 class=head1>I. IN HIS HEAVENLY MINISTRY</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Receiving from God the Believers as Gifts after Bringing Them to the Heavens, and Giving Them to the Church</h2><p>The first thing Christ did in His heavenly ministry was to receive from God the Father the believers as gifts, after bringing them to the heavens, and giving them to the church. Ephesians 4:8 says that the ascended Christ &#8220;gave gifts to men.&#8221; &#8220;Gifts&#8221; here does not refer to abilities or enablements for varied services but to various gifted persons, especially those in verse 11-apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. After conquering and rescuing them from Satan and death through His own death and resurrection, Christ in His ascension made the rescued sinners themselves such gifts with His resurrection life and gave them to His Body for its building up. When the victorious Christ ascended, He led a train of vanquished foes and constituted them into gifts to His Body.<p>Ephesians reveals that Christ is the gift-making and gift-giving Christ. Because Christ is the Head over all things to the church, He is able to make gifts and to present them to the church. Ephesians 1:22 says that Christ is the Head over all things to the church. The word &#8220;to&#8221; is crucial. It implies transmission. Whatever Christ, the Head, attained and obtained is transmitted to the church, His Body. In this transmission the church shares with Christ in all His attainments. Because all that Christ is and has is transmitted to the church, He is able to constitute us as gifts to the Body.<p>Before Christ gave the believers as gifts to the church He first had to receive them from God the Father. In His ascension Christ brought the believers to the heavens in His train of vanquished foes. Then He must have presented the believers to God the Father. Immediately God gave all the believers to Christ as a great gift. Therefore, having received the believers as gifts from the Father, Christ then gave them to the church. On the one hand, Christ received gifts from God the Father; on the other hand, He gave these gifts, which include all the believers, to the church. Hence, the believers are not only materials for the building up of the church; they are also gifts who build up the church. We all are materials for the building and also gifts to do the work of building.<p>Christ ascended to the Father both secretly and publicly. Early in the morning on the day of His resurrection the Lord told Mary that He was ascending to the Father (John 20:17). In this secret ascension He presented Himself to the Father as the firstfruit of resurrection. Forty days later the Lord Jesus ascended publicly. In His public ascension He presented to the Father all the believers as fruits of His resurrection. He led the believers captive in a train of vanquished foes and then presented them to the Father. Therefore, Christ had two ascensions with two presentations to the Father. After the Lord Jesus presented to the Father the believers as the fruits of His resurrection, the Father gave them to the ascended Christ as gifts. Christ received these gifts from the Father and then gave them to His church to build up His Body.<p>Ephesians 4:8 is a quotation from Psalm 68. Psalm 68:18, prophesying of Christ, says, &#8220;Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men.&#8221; This verse speaks of Christ receiving gifts. But Ephesians 4:8 speaks of Christ giving gifts. The prophecy uses the word &#8220;received,&#8221; but the fulfillment uses the word &#8220;gave.&#8221; How are we to understand this? When Paul wrote the book of Ephesians, he was under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and the revealing Spirit is not bound. Psalm 68 was written before Christ&#8217;s ascension, and Ephesians was written afterward. This may be the reason that Psalm 68:18 speaks of receiving and Ephesians 4:8, of giving. Psalm 68 prophesied only concerning the receiving; it did not go on to say anything concerning the giving. But when Paul quoted Psalm 68:18, the giving had been accomplished. Therefore, Paul wrote of this fact, saying not only that Christ received the believers as gifts, as prophesied in Psalm 68, but also that He gave the believers as gifts to the church. Paul took Psalm 68 as the basis for telling us that after His ascension Christ, the Head, gave gifts to the church.<h2 class=head2>2. Sending Forth the Holy Spirit, Promised by the Father, upon the Believers Economically for His Propagation to Produce the Church</h2><p>After receiving the believers as gifts and giving them to the church, Christ, in His heavenly ministry, sent forth the Holy Spirit, promised by the Father, upon the believers economically for His propagation to produce the church. In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.&#8221; The promise here is the promise of Joel 2:28 and 29, fulfilled on the day of Pentecost (Acts 1:4-5, 8; 2:1-4, 16-18), for the outpouring as the power from on high for the believers&#8217; ministry economically. This is different from the Spirit of life, who was breathed into the believers (John 20:22) by the resurrected Christ on the day of His resurrection for His indwelling so that He might be life to them essentially.<p>In order to carry out the work of propagation for the producing of the church, Christ&#8217;s disciples needed to be equipped with the Spirit economically. Essentially, they had what they needed; economically, however, there was a lack. They were to wait in Jerusalem until the ascended Christ poured out upon them the promise of the Father, the promise of the economical Spirit. After His ascension and enthronement, Christ poured out the economical Spirit upon the believers, who had already become members of the Body of Christ essentially. What had been accomplished by Christ in His resurrection was something essential. But the sending forth of the Holy Spirit upon the believers, accomplished by the Lord in His heavenly ministry, was economical.<p>The Spirit in John 20:22 is the Spirit expected in John 7:39 and promised in John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-8, 13. Hence, the Lord&#8217;s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. This fulfillment differs from that in Acts 2:1-4. That was the fulfillment of the Father&#8217;s promise in Luke 24:49. In Acts the Spirit as &#8220;a rushing violent wind&#8221; came as power upon the disciples for their work. In John 20:22 the Spirit as the breath was breathed as life into the disciples for their life. By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the resurrected Christ imparted Himself as life and everything to them essentially.<p>As for the Spirit of life, we need to breathe Him in as the breath. As for the Spirit of power, we need to put Him on as the uniform, typified by the mantle of Elijah (2 Kings 2:9, 13-15). The former as the water of life requires our drinking (John 7:37-39); the latter as the water for baptism requires our being immersed (Acts 1:5). These are the two aspects of the one Spirit for our experience (1 Cor. 12:13). The indwelling of the Spirit of life is essential for our life and living; the outpouring of the Spirit of power is economical for our ministry and work.<p>In receiving the Spirit essentially and economically the believers followed the pattern set up by the Lord Jesus. The Lord was born of the Holy Spirit essentially. This means that the Holy Spirit was the essence of His being. Then when He began His ministry at the age of thirty, the same Holy Spirit who was the essence of His being came upon Him economically. The same Spirit who was the element of Christ&#8217;s being essentially for His living came upon Him economically to empower Him, or anoint Him, for His work to carry out God&#8217;s economy.<p>The Lord&#8217;s believers followed the same pattern. In Christ&#8217;s resurrection we were born of the Holy Spirit as our spiritual essence. Then after Christ&#8217;s ascension the same Spirit was poured out upon us economically that we may work to carry out God&#8217;s economy. Now we have the Spirit within us essentially for our spiritual being and existence, and we also have the same Spirit upon us economically for our work and ministry. The sending forth of the Holy Spirit upon the believers economically was an important aspect of Christ&#8217;s work in His heavenly ministry.<h2 class=head2>3. As the Lord Exercising His Sovereignty over All for the Accomplishment of the Divine Economy</h2><p>In His heavenly ministry Christ is the Lord, exercising His sovereignty over all for the accomplishment of the divine economy (Acts 2:36). In Revelation, Christ, as the Lord in the heavens, is revealed as the Administrator in the divine government in the universe, carrying out God&#8217;s governmental activities over all things on this earth, with the view that all the situations on the earth may serve the purpose for the fulfilling of God&#8217;s plan and His promises that the divine economy might be accomplished.<h2 class=head2>4. As Christ, God&#8217;s Anointed, Carrying Out God&#8217;s Commission to Him  concerning the New Testament Economy</h2><p>In His heavenly ministry Christ, as God&#8217;s Anointed, is doing a work to carry out God&#8217;s commission to Him concerning the New Testament economy (Acts. 2:36). Christ in His ascension has not only been made the Lord of all, but also the Christ of God to work out the spreading of the gospel and the building up of the church that God&#8217;s chosen people may be saved and perfected for the constitution of the New Jerusalem to be God&#8217;s eternal habitation and manifestation, according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy, for God&#8217;s eternal satisfaction.<h2 class=head2>5. As Head over All Things to the Church, Making All Things Work Together for the Producing and Building Up of the Church</h2><p>Christ is Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22). As the Head over all things to the church, He makes all things work together for the producing and building up of the church. In His ascension, Christ was not only made the Lord of all and the Christ of God, but also given to be the Head over all things to the church, that all things may be subjected to and headed up in Him (Eph. 1:10) through the building up of the church which is His Body, the fullness of Him, the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23), for the eternal expression of the Triune God, the Father embodied in the Son, the Son realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Trinity expressed through all of God&#8217;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified saints.<h2 class=head2>6. As Head of the Body, Perfecting His Members by Giving Them Growth in Life for the Building Up of His Body</h2><p>As the Head of the Body, Christ in His heavenly ministry is perfecting His members by giving them growth in life for the building up of His Body (Eph. 4:12, 15-16). This is the finest work Christ is doing in His heavenly ministry. By His sovereignty He brings us together for the accomplishment of the divine economy. Now He is doing a very fine work to perfect us by giving us growth in life. This growth is for the sake of the Body, the church. Through the growth of life we shall arrive at a full-grown man and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ, His expression.<p>Ephesians 4:15 speaks of growing up &#8220;into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&#8221; Here we see that we should grow up into Christ, not grow up into ourselves or into anything apart from Christ. Furthermore, this verse clearly says that we are to grow up into the One who is the Head. This indicates that our growth must be in the Body. In order to grow into the Head, we must surely be in the Body. It is of great significance that Ephesians 4:15 speaks not of growing into the Savior or into the Lord but into the Head. This growth can take place only in the Body.<p>Ephesians 4:15 says that we must grow into the Head in all things. As the members of the Body are perfected through the ministry of Christ, they will grow up into Him in particular matters. We have Christ within us, but in many matters we are still in the self. Hence, we need the growth that will bring us out of ourselves and into Christ. This can take place only through the ministry of Christ.<p>In Ephesians 4:16 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&#8221; Our growth in life is to grow into the Head, Christ, but our function in the Body is to function out from Him. First we grow up into the Head. Then we have something which is out from the Head.<p>Ephesians 4:16 indicates that growth is not for individuals but for the Body. Any growth that is not for the Body is not genuine. The words &#8220;each one part&#8221; refer to every member of the Body. Every member of the Body of Christ has its measure, and this measure works for the growth of the Body. The Body causes the growth of itself through the supplying joints and working parts. Both the joints of the supply and every single part with its measure are needed for the church to build itself up. The growth of the Body is the increase of Christ in the church. This results in the Body building itself up.<p>Ephesians 4:16 tells us that all the Body causes the growth of the Body. This means that the Body grows by the Body itself. The Body makes the growth of the Body. For this reason, Christ, the Head of the Body, gives the growth in life to the members so that they may be perfected for the building up of the Body.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(14)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover several other aspects of Christ&#8217;s work in His heavenly ministry.<h2 class=head2>7. Building the Church</h2><p>In His heavenly ministry Christ is building the church (Matt. 16:18). As the ascended One in the heavens, Christ is directing, managing, the building up of His church on earth. Christ does not build the church by Himself directly, but through His gifted members, the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherd-teachers, as revealed in Ephesians 4:11-12. To have these gifted members, He firstly produced the first group of believers and apostles through His earthly ministry, and through this first group of believers and apostles the gospel was preached and the truths were taught to multiply the number of His believers and gifted members. It is through these multiplied believers and gifted members that the church has been built up under His heavenly ministry. Such a building work is still going on under His heavenly ministry until the completion of this divine work.<h2 class=head2>8. Sanctifying, Cleansing, Nourishing, and Cherishing the Church</h2><p>In His heavenly ministry Christ is also doing the work of sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing the church (Eph. 5:26, 29). To be sanctified is not only to be separated from what is common but also to be saturated with the element of Christ. Hence, one aspect of sanctification is to be separated positionally, to undergo a change of position. Another aspect of sanctification is to become holy dispositionally by having Christ dispensed into us. Christ&#8217;s purpose in giving Himself to the church is to sanctify her, separating her to Himself and saturating her with Himself that she may be His counterpart.<p>Christ&#8217;s work of sanctifying the church is accomplished by cleansing her with the washing of the water in the Word. According to the divine concept, the water in Ephesians 5:26 refers to the flowing life of God typified by flowing water (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4; John 7:38-39; Rev. 21:6; 22:1, 17). The washing of such water is different from the washing of the redeeming blood of Christ. The redeeming blood washes away our sins (1 John 1:7; Rev. 7:14), whereas the water of life washes away the blemishes of the natural life of our old man, such as &#8220;spot or wrinkle or any such things&#8221; (Eph. 5:27). In sanctifying the church, the Lord first washes away our sins with His blood and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life. Spots are something out of the natural life, and wrinkles are signs of oldness. Only the water of life can metabolically wash away such defects. All the spots and wrinkles in the church will be washed away through the inner cleansing of the water in the Word. We all need such an organic, metabolic washing to take away our defects and the marks of our oldness. As the church is washed organically and metabolically in this way, the church is renewed and without blemish. We are now in such a washing process in order that the church may be holy and without blemish.<p>As the Lord Jesus sanctifies and cleanses the church, He also nourishes and cherishes her. To nourish is to feed. For Christ to nourish us means that He supplies us with His riches.<p>This nourishment causes transformation. Since we are what we eat, the more we eat Christ, the more we are constituted of Christ. Then we shall be transformed by the element of Christ that has been dispensed into us. Therefore, through Christ&#8217;s work of nourishing the church we are transformed; we become new persons with a new element and substance.<p>Along with Christ&#8217;s nourishing we have His cherishing. To cherish is to nurture with tender love and foster with tender care. To cherish is also to soften by warming. As a mother cherishes a child by holding the child close to her breast, the Lord Jesus cherishes us by holding us close to Him. In this way we are warmed and softened. The Lord warms us and softens us as we enjoy His tenderness, sweetness, and lovingness. How tender, sweet, and warm the Lord Jesus is! In His work in His heavenly ministry He is the cherishing One.<h2 class=head2>9. As Mediator of the New Covenant, Executing That Covenant, Which Is the New Testament, Enacted and Bequeathed to Us by His Death</h2><p>In His heavenly ministry Christ, as Mediator of the new covenant, is executing that covenant, which is the new testament, enacted and bequeathed to us by His death (Heb. 9:15). In Greek the same word is used for both covenant and testament. A covenant is an agreement with some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people, while a testament is a will with certain accomplished things bequeathed to the inheritors. The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant but a testament with all the things which have been accomplished by the death of Christ bequeathed to us. First God gave the promise that He would make a new covenant (Jer. 31:31-34). Then Christ shed His blood to enact the covenant (Luke 22:20). Because these are accomplished facts promised in this covenant, it is also a testament. This testament, this will, has been confirmed and validated by Christ&#8217;s death, and it is being executed and enforced by Christ in His heavenly ministry. The promise of God&#8217;s covenant is ensured by God&#8217;s faithfulness; God&#8217;s covenant is guaranteed by God&#8217;s righteousness; and the new testament is enforced by the resurrected and ascended Christ in His heavenly ministry.<p>Christ is now in the heavens, living, divine, and capable of executing the new testament. Nothing can frustrate Him. He, the living One, is able to execute the new testament in every detail. As He executes the new testament, He makes every bequest contained in it available and real to us.<p>What Christ is executing today is not merely the new covenant but the new testament, a will that was enacted by His death and bequeathed to us through His resurrection. Now in His heavenly ministry He is executing this will with all its bequests. In ourselves we would never imagine that Christ today, the Mediator of the new covenant, is working to execute this covenant, which has become the new testament. We need to see this crucial aspect of Christ&#8217;s work in His heavenly ministry.<h2 class=head2>10. As the Surety of a Better Covenant, Guaranteeing and Ensuring the Effectiveness of the New Testament</h2><p>As the surety of a better covenant, Christ in His heavenly ministry guarantees and ensures the effectiveness of the new testament. Hebrews 7:22 says, &#8220;Jesus has become the surety of a better covenant.&#8221; The root of the Greek word for &#8220;surety&#8221; means a limb, a member of the body. The meaning is that a member of the body pledges itself to the body. For example, the hand may pledge itself to the arm to do everything for the arm. This pledge is a guarantee. The word surety in Hebrews 7:22 indicates that Christ has pledged Himself to the new covenant and to all of us. He is the bondsman, the guarantee, that He will do everything necessary for the fulfillment of the new covenant. Christ has pledged Himself to the new covenant and to all of us who are under the new covenant. Therefore, He guarantees and ensures the effectiveness of the new testament.<p>The Christ who has pledged Himself to the new covenant and to us and who guarantees and ensures the effectiveness of the new testament is unlimited. He will do everything and He can do everything for us. He is the qualified, capable, and able surety. He is always available and prevailing to fulfill whatever He has guaranteed. Furthermore, His pledging of Himself is all-inclusive. Therefore, the new testament cannot fail, because Christ is the surety. Everything included in the new testament will be fulfilled not by us but by Christ in His work as the surety of a better covenant. Christ is not only the consummator of the new covenant; He is also the surety, the pledge, that everything in it will be fulfilled.<p>Sometimes as we read the Bible we may have doubts concerning certain items that are bequests in the new testament. We may wonder if it is actually possible for us to experience these things. For instance, we may question if the Holy Spirit has actually been poured out economically upon all believers. Because of Christ&#8217;s work in His heavenly ministry as our surety we should not have doubts regarding anything in the new testament. On the one hand, the Bible reveals all the accomplished facts. On the other hand, as our surety Christ is guaranteeing and ensuring everything that is included in the new testament. Therefore, whenever we say &#8220;yes&#8221; to the items in the new testament, Christ will honor our affirmation of faith. This is part of His work in His heavenly ministry.<h2 class=head2>11. As Our Paraclete, Taking Care of Our Affairs on the Ground of His Propitiation for Our Sins</h2><p>As our Paraclete (1 John 2:1), Christ takes care of our affairs on the ground of His propitiation for our sins (v. 2). Often in our daily living we have failures and commit sins. At such times we need Christ as our Paraclete, as our heavenly attorney, to take care of our case on the basis that on the cross He made propitiation for our sins and thus can propitiate our present situation with the righteous God.<p>First John 2:1 says, &#8220;If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.&#8221; &#8220;Advocate&#8221; is a translation of the Greek word parakletos. This word is formed of the preposition para (used here as a prefix) and the word kletos. Put together, these words denote one who is called to another&#8217;s side to aid him, hence, a helper; one who offers legal aid or one who intercedes on behalf of someone else, hence, an advocate, counsel, or intercessor. The word denotes consoling and consolation, hence, a consoler, a comforter. Paraclete is its anglicized form. In His heavenly ministry Christ, as our Advocate, our Paraclete, with the Father, as the One who cares for our case, intercedes on our behalf (Rom. 8:34) and pleads for us if we sin. This interceding and pleading is based on His propitiation.<p>First John 2:1 tells us specifically that Christ is our Advocate with the Father. The Greek word translated &#8220;with&#8221; is pros, with the accusative, a preposition of motion, implying living, acting, in union and communion with. The Lord Jesus as our Paraclete is living in communion with the Father.<p>John&#8217;s use of Father as the divine title here indicates that our case is a family affair, a case between children and the Father. Through regeneration we have been born children of God. After regeneration, in case we sin, it is a matter of children sinning against their Father. Our Advocate undertakes for our sinning to restore our interrupted fellowship with the Father so that we may abide in the enjoyment of the divine fellowship.<p>First John 2:2 goes on to say, &#8220;And He is a propitiation concerning our sins, and not concerning ours only, but also concerning the whole world.&#8221; The Greek word for propitiation here is hilasmos. Our Paraclete, who shed His blood for the cleansing of our sins (1 John 1:7), is our propitiation, a word that indicates appeasing or peacemaking. The Lord Jesus offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins (Heb. 9:28), not only for our redemption but also for God&#8217;s satisfaction. In Him as our Substitute, through His vicarious death, God is satisfied and appeased. Hence, Christ is a propitiation between God and us. With this propitiation as the basis, He does His work as our Paraclete.<h2 class=head2>12. As Our High Priest according to the Order of Melchisedec,  Interceding for Us</h2><p>In His work in His heavenly ministry, Christ is also our High Priest, according to the order of Melchisedec, interceding for us (Heb. 5:10; 7:24-26). The order of Melchisedec is higher than the order of Aaron. The order of Aaron was for the priesthood only in humanity, whereas the order of Melchisedec is for the priesthood both in humanity and divinity. As such a High Priest He ministers to us whatever we need, dispensing the processed Triune God into us as our supply to fulfill God&#8217;s eternal purpose.<p>Christ has been constituted our High Priest according to the power of an indestructible life (Heb. 7:16), which nothing can dissolve. It is an endless life, being the eternal, divine, uncreated life and the resurrection life that has passed through the test of death and Hades (Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18). It is by such a life that Christ ministers today as our High Priest with an unalterable priesthood, a priesthood that, like Him, is forever (Heb. 7:24; 13:8).<p>Hebrews 7:25 says, &#8220;He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, seeing He is always living to intercede for them.&#8221; The word translated &#8220;uttermost&#8221; also means completely, entirely, perfectly, for all time and eternity and to the end. Because Christ lives forever without change, He is able to save us to the uttermost in extent, time, and space.<p>Christ is able to save us completely because He is interceding for us. He is our perpetual, constant, and eternal Intercessor. As our High Priest Christ undertakes our case by interceding for us. He appears before God on our behalf, praying that we may be wholly saved and brought fully into God&#8217;s eternal purpose. Christ intercedes for us constantly, and eventually His intercession will overcome, subdue, and save us. We all shall be completely saved by His intercession. God has appointed Him to take care of us, and He is now caring for us by interceding for us. He is interceding for us now, and He will save us to the uttermost.<p>Hebrews 7:26 goes on to say, &#8220;Such a High Priest befits us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners.&#8221; As such a perfect One, He surely befits us. We, having a fallen and corrupted nature, need the work of such a High Priest to save us all the time.<p>Hebrews 7:26 also says that Christ has &#8220;become higher than the heavens.&#8221; In His ascension Christ &#8220;has passed through the heavens&#8221; (Heb. 4:14), and now He is not only in heaven (Heb. 9:24) but is also higher than the heavens. Because our High Priest is higher than the heavens, He is able, in His heavenly ministry, to rescue us and save us to the uttermost.<h2 class=head2>13. As a Minister of the True Tabernacle, Serving God&#8217;s People with the Bequests of the New Testament</h2><p>Finally, in His heavenly ministry Christ is a Minister of the true, the heavenly tabernacle (Heb. 8:2), serving God&#8217;s people with the bequests, the blessings, of the new testament. As our heavenly Minister with a more excellent ministry, Christ is carrying out the better covenant. He does this by making the facts of the new covenant effective. Every fact in the new covenant is made effective by the heavenly Minister with His more excellent ministry.<p>Christ, the heavenly Minister, is also executing the bequests in the new testament. Whatever is a fact in the covenant is a bequest in the testament. Facts refer to certain things that have been accomplished but which are not yet designated until they are bequeathed. After the accomplished facts have been bequeathed, they immediately become bequests designated for us. Whatever is in a covenant is a fact, but whatever is in a testament is a bequest. What were facts in the covenant have now become legally designated for us as bequests in the testament. There are four facts of the new covenant which have become bequests in the new testament: the propitiation for unrighteousness and forgiveness of sins; the imparting of the law of life; the blessing of having God and of being His people; and the inward ability of knowing the Lord. In His work in His heavenly ministry Christ is now serving us with these bequests.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(15)</h1><p>We come now to another classification of Christ&#8217;s work-His work in the divine administration. <h2 class=head1>J. IN THE DIVINE ADMINISTRATION</h2><h2 class=head2>1. As the Ruler of the Kings of the Earth Ruling the Whole World That the Gospel May Be Spread and the Church May Be Produced</h2><p>In His work in the divine administration Christ is the Ruler of the kings of the earth. As the Ruler of the kings of the earth, Christ rules the whole earth that the gospel may be spread and the church may be produced. Apparently the earth is ruled by kings and presidents. Actually the earth is ruled by Christ, the highest Ruler, who is above all kings and presidents. If we study history in the light of the Bible, we shall realize that history has been altogether under the hand of Christ as the Ruler of the kings. He is ruling sovereignly over the earth with His authority so that the environment may be fit for God&#8217;s chosen people to receive His salvation (Acts 17:26-27; John 17:2). He is managing the world&#8217;s situation for the purpose of producing the church so that He may come back to establish the kingdom of God on earth. Now we need to do our part by being faithful to Him so that He may use us to spread the gospel and build up the church.<h2 class=head2>2. As the High Priest,  Judging and Purifying the Churches and Holding the Messengers of the Churches</h2><p>In the divine administration Christ is also the High Priest, judging and purifying the churches and holding the messengers of the churches. Revelation 1:13 says, &#8220;In the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.&#8221; Here Christ is depicted as the High Priest, as shown by His garment, a priestly robe reaching to the feet, signifying the fullness of His divine attributes and human virtues. Verse 14 says that His eyes are as a &#8220;flame of fire.&#8221; This fire is for divine judgment. Hence, the main significance of the Lord&#8217;s eyes being as a flame of fire is for His judgment. Furthermore, verse 15 says, &#8220;His feet were like shining brass, as having been fired in a furnace.&#8221; Here the feet signify the walk. In typology brass signifies divine judgment (Exo. 27:1-6). Christ&#8217;s feet being like shining brass indicates that His perfect and bright walk qualifies Him to exercise divine judgment. Therefore, in the divine administration Christ is judging the churches and purifying them.<p>Revelation 1:16, 20 and 2:1 indicate that, as the High Priest, Christ is holding the messengers of the churches. These messengers are signified by the seven stars in His right hand. The messengers of the churches are the spiritual ones in the churches bearing the responsibility of the testimony of Jesus. They should be of the heavenly nature and in a heavenly position like stars.<p>Revelation 2:12 says that Christ &#8220;has the sharp two-edged sword,&#8221; and 2:18, that He &#8220;has eyes as a flame of fire, and His feet like shining brass.&#8221; In dealing with the church in Pergamos, the worldly church, Christ refers to Himself as the One who has the sharp two-edged sword. In dealing with the church in Thyatira, the apostate church, He refers to Himself as the One who has eyes as a flame of fire and whose feet are like shining brass. The worldly church requires the dealing of His smiting and killing word, whereas the apostate church needs the judging of His searching eyes and treading feet.<p>Today in the recovery Christ, the High Priest in the divine administration, is not only building up the churches in different localities but also judging and purifying them. He is also holding the responsible ones, the faithful ones, who are bearing the burden of His testimony on earth. We trust in Him and look to Him for His continued purifying and holding so that we all may go on in a pure way.<h2 class=head2>3. As the Lion-Lamb, the Overcoming Redeemer, Opening the Scroll of God&#8217;s Economy</h2><p>In the divine administration Christ, as the Lion-Lamb, the overcoming Redeemer, opens the scroll of God&#8217;s economy (Rev. 5:3-7; 6:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12; 8:1). In Revelation 5:1 the One sitting on the throne has a scroll in His hand sealed with seven seals. These seven seals are the contents of the scroll, and the scroll itself is the new covenant, enacted with the blood of the Lamb. Hence, the new covenant is a scroll covering the redemption of the church, Israel, the world, and the universe.<p>Here we see the secrecy of God&#8217;s administration in the universe. Throughout the centuries, wise men have earnestly tried to learn the secret of the universe. But they failed because they did not have the revelation. Although the new testament was enacted by the death of Christ, it has been a mystery to mankind. In the book of Revelation the resurrected and ascended Christ opens the scroll of God&#8217;s economy.<p>As the One who opens the scroll, Christ is portrayed as the Lion-Lamb, as the overcoming Redeemer. In Revelation 5:5 we have this word: &#8220;Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals.&#8221; Then verse 6 goes on to speak of a &#8220;Lamb standing as having been slain.&#8221; Christ is both the fighting, victorious, and overcoming Lion and the Redeeming Lamb. As the Lion, He is the Fighter against the enemy, Satan; as the Lamb, He is the Redeemer for us. He has fought to redeem us, and He has won the battle over the enemy and accomplished redemption for us.<p>As the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Christ has overcome the enemy of God. He has solved this problem for God and has removed the hindrances to the fulfillment of God&#8217;s purpose. God&#8217;s purpose needs someone to carry it out who can solve all the problems of God. The problems which God had were the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man. As the Lion, Christ has defeated rebellious Satan, and as the Lamb He has taken away the sin of fallen man. Because He has solved these problems for God, He is worthy to open the scroll of God&#8217;s economy and its seven seals.<p>Christ opens the first four seals in Revelation 6:1-8. These seals comprise four horses with their riders in a four-horse race. These riders are not real persons but personified things. The rider of the second horse, the red horse, is war (v. 4); the rider of the third horse, the black horse, is famine (vv. 5-6); and the rider of the fourth horse, the pale horse, is death (v. 8). According to historical facts, the rider of the first horse, the white horse, is the preaching of the gospel. White signifies clean, pure, just, and approvable. The white horse with its rider is a symbol of the preaching of the gospel which is clean, pure, just, and approvable both to men and to God. Immediately after Christ&#8217;s ascension, these four things-the gospel, war, famine, and death-began to run like riders on four horses and will continue until Christ comes back.<p>The opening of the fifth seal (Rev. 6:9) discloses Christian martyrdom from the first century to the time near the end of this age. As the gospel is being preached, there is always the martyrdom of the faithful saints.<p>In Revelation 6:12 Christ, the overcoming Redeemer, opens the sixth seal. This seal, which marks the beginning of supernatural calamities, is God&#8217;s answer to the cry of the martyred saints in the fifth seal. After the opening of the sixth seal, the Lord comes in to shake the earth and the host of the heavens. This great shaking will be a warning on earth to repent and turn to God. This calamity is not the actual wrath of God. Rather, it indicates that God will soon come in to avenge the martyred saints and to vindicate Himself.<p>Whereas the first four seals of the scroll of God&#8217;s economy are simultaneous, the fifth and sixth seals are consecutive. The seventh seal includes everything from after the sixth seal to eternity future. Thus, the seventh seal, consisting of the seven trumpets, is all-inclusive.<p>Revelation 8:1 says that when the Lion-Lamb &#8220;opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour.&#8221; This silence indicates solemnity. At the opening of the seventh seal, all heaven becomes silent because the age is about to be changed. The period before the opening of the seventh seal was the age of God&#8217;s toleration. For the sake of His purpose of preaching the gospel to produce the churches to fulfill His eternal plan, God has been tolerating the sinful situation on earth. But with the opening of the seventh seal the age of toleration is terminated, and another age is brought in-the age of God&#8217;s wrath. The opening of these seven seals is Christ&#8217;s work as the overcoming Redeemer in the divine administration.<h2 class=head2>4. As Another Angel</h2><p>In His work in the divine administration Christ is also another Angel (Rev. 7:2; 8:3; 10:1; 18:1). As another Angel Christ stands on the position of One who has been sent by God. In the Old Testament Christ was called the Angel of the Lord, who was God Himself (Gen. 22:11-12; Exo. 3:2-6; Judg. 6:11-24; Zech. 1:11-12; 2:8-11; 3:1-7). In the book of Revelation He is again called the Angel. Christ is another Angel; He is the unique, special Angel.<h2 class=head3>a. Taking Care of God&#8217;s People, Both the Sons of Israel and the Believers</h2><p>As another Angel Christ takes care of God&#8217;s people, both the sons of Israel and the believers (Rev. 7:2-17). First He cares for the chosen remnant of Israel (7:2-8). Revelation 7:2 and 3 say, &#8220;I saw another Angel ascend from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea, saying, Do not harm the earth nor the sea nor the trees until we have sealed the slaves of our God upon their foreheads.&#8221; Before the first four trumpets the Lord will seal the chosen Israelites from the supernatural calamities that will be carried out by these trumpets. In 7:4-8 we see that He will seal one hundred forty-four thousand out of every tribe of the sons of Israel, sealing twelve thousand out of each of the twelve tribes. These are the Israelites who will keep the commandments of God during the great tribulation (Rev. 12:17; 14:12). We do not know what kind of seal this will be, but it will be a mark recognizable to the angels sent to judge the earth. This is the Lord&#8217;s way of preserving the chosen Israelites while He is executing His judgment upon the earth.<p>In His work as another Angel Christ also takes care of the believers, the redeemed saints of the church. This is seen in Revelation 7:9-17, where we have a vision of the preservation of the redeemed ones throughout all the tribulations. The Lord&#8217;s way to preserve the remnant of Israel is to seal them and leave them on earth. His way to preserve the believers is to take them away by means of rapture. Eventually all the redeemed saints will be raptured from earth to heaven.<h2 class=head3>b. Executing God&#8217;s Judgment upon the Earth, the Sea, the Rivers, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and Men</h2><p>Revelation 8:3-9:21 discloses how Christ as another Angel executes God&#8217;s judgment upon the earth, the sea, the rivers, the sun, the moon, the stars, and men. Revelation 8:3-5 portrays the scene in heaven after the opening of the seventh seal. Christ as another Angel adds incense to the prayers of the saints (vv. 3-4). Then He takes the censer, fills it with the fire of the altar, and casts it to the earth (v. 5). The prayers of the saints here must be for the judgment of the earth which opposes God&#8217;s economy. The answer to these prayers is the execution of God&#8217;s judgment. To cast fire to the earth is to execute God&#8217;s judgment upon the earth.<p>With the sounding of the seven trumpets, Christ as another Angel executes God&#8217;s judgment. With the first trumpet there is judgment on the earth (8:7); with the second, judgment on the sea (vv. 8-9); with the third, judgment on the rivers (vv. 10-11); with the fourth, judgment on the sun, moon, and stars (v. 12); with the fifth, which is the first woe, judgment on men (8:13-9:11); and with the sixth, which is the second woe, further judgment on men (9:12-21).<h2 class=head3>c. Coming to Take Possession of the Sea and the Land</h2><p>In Revelation 10:1 and 2 Christ comes as another Angel to take possession of the sea and the land. Revelation 10:1 says, &#8220;I saw another strong Angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon His head, and His face was as the sun, and His feet as pillars of fire.&#8221; The rainbow indicates that Christ, in His judgment upon the earth, will keep the covenant God made with Noah (Gen. 9:8-17). The pillars indicate steadfastness (Jer. 1:18; Gal. 2:9), and fire signifies the holiness of God (Exo. 19:18; Heb. 12:29), according to which Christ will execute His judgment upon the earth.<p>Revelation 10:2 continues, &#8220;And having in His hand a little opened scroll. And He placed His right foot on the sea and the left on the land.&#8221; The little opened scroll is the scroll in 5:1, the scroll of God&#8217;s economy, which only Christ is worthy to open. In 5:1 it was sealed; here it is opened.<p>For Christ as another Angel to place His feet on the sea and upon the land is to tread upon them, and to tread upon them is to take possession of them (Deut. 11:24; Josh. 1:3; Psa. 8:6). This indicates that Christ is coming to take possession of the earth. Only He is worthy to open the scroll of God&#8217;s economy, and only He is qualified to possess the earth.<h2 class=head3>d. Coming to Declare the Judgment over Babylon the Great</h2><p>Finally, Christ in His work as another Angel will come to declare the judgment over Babylon the Great. Revelation 18:1 and 2 say, &#8220;After these things I saw another Angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was illumined with His glory. And He cried with a strong voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!&#8221; In 10:1 Christ is still clothed with a cloud, whereas here His glory shines over the earth, indicating that His coming back to earth is closer than the coming mentioned in chapter ten. In His coming Christ will eventually shine over the whole earth to destroy Babylon the Great with great authority. The fall of Babylon pronounced in verse 2 is the fall of material Babylon, which will take place at the end of the great tribulation.<h2 class=head2>5. As the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, Defeating and Judging  Antichrist with His False Prophet and All His Followers from the Nations- the Kings, Their Armies, and Their Peoples</h2><p>Finally, in His work in the divine administration Christ, as the King of kings and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:16), will defeat and judge Antichrist with his false prophet and all his followers from the nations-the kings, their armies, and their peoples. Revelation 19:11 says, &#8220;I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.&#8221; Here we see Christ as the One leading His army to fight Antichrist and the kings under him and their armies at Armageddon. Antichrist and the false prophet will be &#8220;cast alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone&#8221; (v. 20). The rest will be killed &#8220;with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse&#8221; (v. 21). After Christ takes away the overcomers and the majority of saints by means of rapture, He will come back to defeat Antichrist with his false prophet and all his followers. Then He will judge the living nations and set up the millennial kingdom.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SEVENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>CHRIST-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(16)</h1><p>In this message, the last on Christ&#8217;s work, we shall cover Christ&#8217;s work at His coming back, in the millennium, after the millennium, and in the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head1>K. AT HIS COMING BACK</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Reaping the Firstfruit</h2><p>The first aspect of Christ&#8217;s work at His coming back is the reaping of the firstfruit (Rev. 14:1-5). Revelation 14:4 speaks of those who are the &#8220;firstfruit to God and to the Lamb,&#8221; those in God&#8217;s crop who mature the earliest and who are reaped for His satisfaction. As the first ones to ripen, they will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruit to God and to the Lamb. According to Revelation 14:14-16, the harvest will be reaped later. This means that the firstfruit will be raptured to the heavens before the harvest, just as the firstfruit of the good land was reaped and brought into the temple of God before the harvest (Lev. 23:10-11; Exo. 23:19). The events recorded in Revelation 14:6-13, all of which will take place during the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), indicate clearly and prove strongly that the first overcomers as the firstfruit will be raptured before the great tribulation, and the harvest, which includes the majority of believers, will be raptured toward the end of the great tribulation.<p>In the New Testament a special Greek word is used for Christ&#8217;s coming-the word parousia, which means presence. Christ&#8217;s coming back will be His presence with His people. This presence will begin with the reaping, the rapture, of the firstfruit and end with His appearing on earth with His saints. Christ&#8217;s parousia will begin while He is still on the throne in the heavens. The first thing the Lord Jesus will do in His coming back will be to bring the firstfruit into His presence, into His parousia. Then during the period of His parousia, there will be supernatural calamities (Rev. 8:7-12), the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21; Rev. 9:1-21; 11:14; 16:1-21), Christ&#8217;s descending to the air (Rev. 14:14), the rapture of the majority of the believers to the air (1 Thes. 4:15-17), the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10), and the marriage of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9).<h2 class=head2>2. Taking Up the Overcomers</h2><p>In addition to reaping the firstfruit, Christ at His coming back will also take up the overcomers (Matt. 24:39-44; Luke 17:34-35; 21:34-36; Rev. 3:10). Like the firstfruit, the overcomers will be taken up by the Lord Jesus before the great tribulation. However, we do not know whether the reaping of the firstfruit and the rapture of the overcomers will be one matter or two separate matters. Concerning this there is no clear indication in the New Testament.<p>Matthew 24:39-44 speaks of the taking up of the overcomers. Concerning two men in the field and two women grinding at the mill, we are told that &#8220;one is taken, and one is left&#8221; (vv. 40-41). This is to be raptured before the great tribulation.<p>Verses 42 and 43 continue, &#8220;Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes. But know this, that if the householder knew in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.&#8221; The householder here refers to the believer, and the house, to the believer&#8217;s conduct and work that he has built up in his Christian life. The Lord will come secretly as a thief, who steals precious things at an unknown time, to those who love Him and take them away as His treasures. Hence, we should watch.<p>Matthew 24:44 concludes, &#8220;Therefore, you also, be ready, for the Son of Man comes in an hour that you think not.&#8221; This refers to Christ&#8217;s secret coming to take up the watchful overcomers.<p>In Luke 17:34 and 35 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;I tell you, in that night there will be two on one couch; the one will be taken, and the other will be left. There will be two grinding at the same place; the one will be taken, but the other will be left.&#8221; In these verses the rapture of the overcoming believers is revealed. It will occur secretly and unexpectedly, at night to some believers who are sleeping, in the daytime to some sisters grinding at home and to some brothers working in the field. They are chosen because they have overcome the stupefying effect of the age. In Luke 17:22-37 the Lord Jesus charges us to overcome the stupefying effect of self-indulgent living in this age so that we may be raptured into the enjoyment of His parousia, His presence.<p>In Luke 21:34-36 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Take heed to yourselves lest at some time your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and anxieties of life, and that day come upon you suddenly as a snare; for it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth. But be watchful, at every time beseeching, that you may prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.&#8221; To &#8220;escape all these things&#8221; is to be taken, raptured, before the great tribulation, which will be a severe trial upon the whole inhabited earth. Standing before the Son of Man corresponds to the standing in Revelation 14:1. This indicates that the raptured overcomers will stand before the Savior on Mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation.<p>Revelation 3:10 says, &#8220;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.&#8221; The word &#8220;trial&#8221; here undoubtedly denotes the great tribulation. The Lord promises the recovered church that He will keep her out of the hour of trial, not only out of the trial. This promise of the Lord, like that in Luke 21:36, indicates that the saints who keep the word of the Lord&#8217;s endurance will be raptured before the great trial. This implies that those who do not keep the word of His endurance will be left in the trial.<h2 class=head2>3. Catching Up the Majority of the Saints in Clouds-Reaping the Harvest</h2><p>After the firstfruit is reaped and the overcomers are taken up, during the tribulation Christ will descend with them to the air. Then He will catch up the majority of the saints in clouds (1 Thes. 4:16-17). Here we have two different times and locations. The firstfruit and the over-comers are taken to the throne in the heavens before the tribulation; the majority of the saints are taken to the air toward the end of the tribulation.<p>The catching up of the majority of the believers in clouds is the reaping of the harvest in Revelation 14:14-16. Verse 14 says, &#8220;I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud One sitting like the Son of Man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.&#8221; The sharp sickle in the Lord&#8217;s hand indicates that He is the One who reaps God&#8217;s field.<p>Verse 15 continues, &#8220;Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Send forth Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.&#8221; The harvest of the earth is God&#8217;s people on earth, the believers in Christ (1 Cor. 3:9). At His first coming the Lord Jesus sowed Himself into His believers (Matt. 13:3-8, 24). All the believers since that time who have received Him as the seed of life have become the crop of God on earth. The first ripe ones will be reaped as the firstfruit to God, whereas the majority will ripen with the help of the sufferings in the great tribulation and will be reaped near the end of the tribulation. The suffering of the great tribulation will be like the parching sun, drying the earthly water from the believers who will be left on earth in the great tribulation that they may ripen.<p>Finally, verse 16 says, &#8220;He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.&#8221; This reaping is the rapture of the majority of the believers who will be left on earth to pass through the greater part of the great tribulation.<h2 class=head2>4. Judging the Raptured Saints</h2><p>After all the saints have been caught up to the air, Christ will set up His judgment seat. He will judge all the believers, assigning them either a reward or some kind of punishment. Second Corinthians 5:10 says, &#8220;We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may be recompensed for the things done through the body, according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad.&#8221; Christ&#8217;s judgment of believers at His coming back will not be concerning their eternal salvation but their dispensational reward. At that time the Lord &#8220;shall both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each one from God&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:5).<p>Romans 14:10 tells us that &#8220;we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.&#8221; This will take place before the millennium, immediately after Christ&#8217;s coming back for the judgment of the resurrected and raptured believers with respect to reward in the millennial kingdom. Therefore, this judgment will take account of how the believers have lived before the Lord and what work they have done for the Lord after they were saved.<h2 class=head2>5. Marrying the Overcoming Saints</h2><p>Next, in His work at His coming back Christ will marry the overcoming saints. This is described in Revelation 19:7-9. Verse 7 says, &#8220;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready.&#8221; The marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. God&#8217;s economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age. Then the bride with the overcoming believers will be ready.<p>The words &#8220;His wife&#8221; in Revelation 19:7 refer to the church (Eph. 5:24-25, 31-32), the bride of Christ (John 3:29). However, according to Revelation 19:8 and 9, the wife, the bride of Christ, here consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium, whereas the bride, the wife, in Revelation 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity. The readiness of the bride depends on the maturity in life of the overcomers. Furthermore, the overcomers are not separate individuals but a corporate bride. For this, building is needed. The overcomers are not only mature in life but also built together as the bride.<p>Revelation 19:8 goes on to say, &#8220;It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.&#8221; &#8220;Righteousnesses&#8221; does not refer to the righteousness we receive for our salvation. The righteousness we receive for salvation is objective so that we may meet the requirement of the righteous God. The righteousnesses of the overcoming saints are subjective so that they may meet the requirements of the overcoming Christ. The fine linen with which the overcomers are clothed is equal to the marriage garment in Matthew 22:11 and 12.<p>Revelation 19:9 concludes, &#8220;Blessed are they who are invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb.&#8221; The marriage dinner of the Lamb is the marriage feast in Matthew 22:2. It will be a reward to the overcoming believers. Only the overcomers, not all the saved ones, will be invited to it. The foolish virgins in Matthew 25:8-13 will miss it. However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity. Hence, to be invited to the marriage feast of Christ, which will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium, is to be blessed. The overcoming believers invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb will also be the bride of the Lamb. Therefore, at His coming back Christ will marry the overcoming saints.<h2 class=head2>6. Slaying Antichrist</h2><p>After Christ marries the overcomers, He will slay Antichrist. &#8220;The lawless one shall be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the appearing of His coming)&#8221; (2 Thes. 2:8). This will be fulfilled in Revelation 19:19 and 20: &#8220;I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army. And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who in his presence had done the signs, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worship his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.&#8221; As the heavenly general with the overcoming saints, the faithful ones, as His army, Christ at His coming back will fight against Antichrist, slay him, and cast him into the lake of fire.<h2 class=head2>7. Gathering and Saving All the Tribes of Israel</h2><p>At His coming back Christ will also gather and save all the tribes of Israel. In Paul&#8217;s words, at that time &#8220;all Israel will be saved, as it is written. The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob&#8221; (Rom. 11:26).<p>Matthew 24:30 and 31 say, &#8220;The sign of the Son of Man shall appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the land shall wail, and they shall see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He shall send His angels with a loud trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from the extremities of the heavens to their extremities.&#8221; The tribes here refer to the tribes of the nation of Israel, and the land, to the holy land. At Christ&#8217;s appearing all the tribes of Israel will repent and wail (Zech. 12:10-14; Rev. 1:7). After the great tribulation, at His coming back to earth, the Lord will gather together the scattered Jews from all parts of the earth to the holy land. This will be the fulfillment not only of His word in Matthew 23:37 but also of God&#8217;s promise in the Old Testament (Deut. 30:3-5; Isa. 43:5-7; 49:9-13, 22-26; 51:11; 56:8; 60:4; 62:10-12; 27:13; Ezek. 34:13; 37:21; 28:25).<h2 class=head2>8. Judging the Gentiles, the Living Peoples</h2><p>Finally, in His work at His coming back Christ will judge the Gentiles, the living peoples. This will be the day of Christ&#8217;s judgment of the inhabited earth (Acts 17:31). This is the day when Christ will judge the living at the throne of His glory (Matt. 25:31-46). After He defeats Antichrist and his army, many of the Gentiles will still be living on earth. The Lord will gather them to Himself and judge them. Matthew 25:31 and 32 say, &#8220;When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He shall sit on His throne of glory; and all the nations shall be gathered before Him, and He shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.&#8221; &#8220;All the nations&#8221; are all the Gentiles who will be left at Christ&#8217;s coming back to earth after He destroys those Gentiles who follow Antichrist at Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16; 19:11-15, 19-21). Those that are regarded as sheep will be transferred into the millennium to be the people under the kingly ruling of Christ and the overcoming believers (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4-6) and under the priestly ministry of the saved Jews (Zech. 8:20-23). Those who are regarded as goats will go with their leader, Antichrist, &#8220;into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels&#8221; (Matt. 25:41).<p>On earth today there are three categories of people: the believers who comprise the church, Israel as God&#8217;s chosen people, and the Gentiles. At His coming back the Lord will deal with all three categories. First, He will take up the overcoming believers and later catch up the majority of the saints. Then He will judge all the believers, selecting those who will make up His bride and His army. Following this, He will marry the overcoming saints and come with His army to destroy Antichrist and his army. Then He will gather and save the scattered Jews. After He sets up His throne in Jerusalem, He will judge all those who remain from the nations. In this way Christ in His work at His coming back will deal with the believers, the Jews, and the Gentiles.<h2 class=head1>L. IN THE MILLENNIUM</h2><p>In His work in the millennium Christ with His overcomers as co-kings will reign over all the nations (Rev. 20:4, 6; 2:27; 19:15c). The millennium will be the last section of God&#8217;s kingdom on this earth in the old creation over the God-created, fallen, and restored nations. They all will be the last stage of human nations on the old earth, and they all will become the kingdom of God&#8217;s Christ (Rev. 11:15), and Christ and His overcomers shall be the kings over them. Such a reigning will be the unique work of Christ in the millennium to show, for one thousand years, to the entire universe His kingship with His divine and heavenly authority for the shame of Satan, the defeated enemy of God, who will then be bound and imprisoned in the abyss, the bottomless pit (Rev. 20:2-3).<h2 class=head1>M. AFTER THE MILLENNIUM</h2><p>After the millennium Christ will do the work of judging all the dead, for He is the Judge of both the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1). This judgment is described in Revelation 20:11-15. Verse 12 says, &#8220;I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by the things which were written in the books, according to their works.&#8221; The &#8220;standing&#8221; here indicates that the dead have been resurrected. This is the resurrection of the unbelievers, the resurrection of judgment (John 5:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:23-24). The books are a record of the works, the deeds, of the unbelievers, according to which they will be judged.<p>Verse 13 continues, &#8220;The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged everyone according to their works.&#8221; Because the dead unbelievers who were drowned in the sea are included among those in Hades, the dead given up by the sea should not be any unbelieving human beings. Rather, they may be the spirits (the demons today-Matt. 8:31-32; 12:43) of the living beings of the preadamic age (see Life-study of Genesis, Message 2). This may indicate that today&#8217;s demons will be judged at the great white throne along with unbelieving human beings.<p>Verse 14 goes on to say, &#8220;Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.&#8221; In the first death the soul and the spirit are separated from the body and perish in the suffering section of Hades (Luke 16:22-24). In the second death the soul and the spirit, after being rejoined to the body in resurrection, are cast with the body into the lake of fire. This means that the unbelievers&#8217; whole being-spirit, soul, and body-will perish in eternal torment in the lake of fire.<p>Revelation 20:15 concludes, &#8220;If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.&#8221; Christ will judge the perishing unbelievers according to the books, which are a record of their works. But they will be cast into the lake of fire according to the book of life. This indicates that they are condemned by the Lord because of their evil deeds, but they perish because of their unbelief, not having their names written in the book of life. Not believing in the Lord Jesus is the unique sin that causes people to perish (John 16:9).<h2 class=head1>N. IN THE NEW JERUSALEM-IN ETERNITY</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s work in judging the dead will mark the end of the old creation. Then the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem will come. In the New Jerusalem-in eternity-Christ will still be working.<h2 class=head2>1. As the Redeeming God, Administrating within the New Jerusalem in the New Heaven and the New Earth</h2><p>As the redeeming God Christ will administrate within the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth. Revelation 22:1 and 3 tell us that the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the New Jerusalem. According to the context of this portion of the Word, the throne of God and of the Lamb is the center of the New Jerusalem. From this throne Christ, the redeeming God, carries out His administration, based on His redemption, in the eternal kingdom in the new heaven and the new earth.<p>Christ&#8217;s work in administrating within the New Jerusalem is for His expression through His administration. All that the redeeming God administrates is for the purpose that He might be expressed. In the New Jerusalem the throne of the redeeming God will be in the center of the city, and His expression will extend to its circumference. Therefore, the redeeming God administrating on the throne is the God both of administration and of expression. His administration serves the purpose of His expression in His eternal manifestation.<h2 class=head2>2. As the Lamp of the Holy City, Shining with God as Light from within the New Jerusalem over the Nations</h2><p>In His work in the New Jerusalem Christ, as the lamp of the holy city, will shine with God as light from within the New Jerusalem over the nations. &#8220;The city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb. And the nations shall walk by its light&#8221; (Rev. 21:23-24a). The Lamb as the lamp will shine with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light. Because such a divine light will illumine the holy city, it will not have need of any other light, whether created by God or made by man (Rev. 22:5). Although the sun and moon will be in the new heaven and new earth, we shall have no need of them in the New Jerusalem, because our dwelling place will be much brighter than either of them. Christ, the lamp, will shine with God as light.<p>The nations will walk by this light. In the millennium the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be intensified sevenfold (Isa. 30:26). I believe that in the new heaven and the new earth the light of the sun will be even brighter than this. Nevertheless, Revelation 21:24a says that the nations will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem. Christ will shine with God as light, and this shining will be brighter than that of either the moon or the sun. Actually, the nations will not need to walk in the sunlight, for they will walk in the light of Christ&#8217;s shining.<h2 class=head2>3. As the Tree of Life, Nourishing the Sons of God-the Saints as the Components of the New Jerusalem- and Healing the Nations as the Peoples of God on the New Earth</h2><p>Finally, in His work in the New Jerusalem Christ, as the tree of life, will nourish the sons of God-the saints as the components of the New Jerusalem-and heal the nations as the peoples of God on the new earth (Rev. 22:2; 21:7). For eternity in the new heaven and the new earth, all God&#8217;s redeemed will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their eternal portion. Eternally, Christ will carry on the work of nourishing the sons of God (Rev. 21:7).<p>In Revelation 22:2 the tree of life growing on the two sides of the river signifies that the tree of life is a vine, spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life for God&#8217;s people to receive and enjoy. Christ as the tree of life, as the life supply, will be available along the flow of the Spirit as the water of life. Where the Spirit flows, there the life supply of Christ will be found. The fruits of the tree of life will be the food of God&#8217;s redeemed for eternity.<p>The last part of Revelation 22:2 says, &#8220;The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&#8221; Whereas the sons of God, who are the components of the New Jerusalem, are born of God with His life and nature, the nations are the peoples in Revelation 21:3. After the millennial kingdom, those of the nations who are not deceived by the Devil to rebel against the Lord will be transferred to the new earth as the nations living around the New Jerusalem. They, as the created unregenerated man, will be maintained to live forever in their created state by the healing of the leaves of the tree of life. These leaves symbolize the deeds of Christ.<p>In the new heaven and the new earth the regenerated believers will eat the fruit of the tree of life, receiving Christ as their life and life supply inwardly so that they may enjoy the divine life for eternity. But the restored nations will be healed by the leaves of the tree of life, taking the deeds of Christ as their guide and regulation outwardly so that they may live the human life forever. When the nations look at the way the Lord Jesus does things and behaves Himself, His deeds will become a source of healing to them, and this healing will maintain their human life forever.</body></html>
