   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE TWO THE GROWTH IN LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Col 2:19; 1 Cor 3:6-7, 9; 1 Pet 2:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this series of messages we shall consider the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Colossians 2:19, 1 Corinthians 3:6-7 and 9, and 1 Peter 2:2 are the best verses in the New Testament related to the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 4:13-16 speaks of the growth of the Body rather than the growth in life of the members individually.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>GROWING WITH THE GROWTH OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 3:6-7 says, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow; so that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One who makes to grow, God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 9 says, "For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's farm, God's building."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Growth in these verses is not the growth in knowledge because here Paul speaks of a farm.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Planting and watering are not related to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To plant is not to instruct but to nourish by supplying the plant with fertile soil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, to water is not to teach but to supply the plant with nutrients in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Colossians 2:19 says, "Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, by means of the joints and bands being supplied and knit together, grows with the growth of God."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These verses show us that to grow is to grow with something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a young boy does not eat or drink, he will have nothing with which to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One cannot grow with nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, without something with which to grow, one will die.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Dietitians tell us that we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we eat beef, we will be constituted with the meat of the cow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we eat fish, we will be constituted with fish.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God created man in His own image according to His own likeness Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then He breathed His breath into man, and after getting into man, that breath became man's spirit Gen 2:7; Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are the two particular characteristics of the created man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Outwardly man has God's image, and inwardly man has God's breath as his own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Strictly speaking, however, God's breath alone is not His life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's life is God Himself, the divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the time of his creation, man did not have God's life, God Himself, within him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He had only God's image as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This image may be compared to a photograph.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My photograph may bear my image, but it does not have me in it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The life within the created man was only man's life, and after the fall this life became death itself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This created man was made as a vessel Rom 9:21-23 with the ability to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To eat is to receive, digest, assimilate, and retain something organic.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anything that is not organic is not good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Something must be organic for us to eat it, and as we have seen, whatever we eat eventually becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we must be careful about our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be careful about eating is the first charge that God gave to man Gen 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Genesis 2 God did not give Adam commandments concerning his conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The commandments concerning faithfulness, lying, stealing, and obedience to parents were given after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before the fall, right after God's creation of man, God gave only one charge.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Genesis 2:16-17a says, "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The tree of life was good for food, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was also good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even today there are two trees among us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One tree is God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we eat this tree, we become life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The other tree is the source of death, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we eat him, we receive the source of death, that is, we receive him as death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Romans 8:6 says, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we eat life, we will receive life and will become life, but if we eat death, we will not only die but will become death.</S>
