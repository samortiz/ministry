   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPENDIX SEVEN PRAYER A DIVINE NECESSITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The following is an excerpt from an article by Evan Roberts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It originally appeared in The Overcomer, Vol. 4, published by The "Overcomer" Office, Leicester, England, February 1912.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The paragraphs below reflect the order in Watchman Nee's publication.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If God can do things without prayer in the church, why does He not carry them out in His own time instead of delays and hindrances?...And why does God lay a complaint against the church that she does not pray?...Why did Christ say, "Pray ye the Lord of the Harvest to send forth labourers?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why did He not send them apart from prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>...There is value in the expression of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is the meaning of "Ye have not because ye ask not"?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Is it God's unwillingness i.e., you shall not "get" if you do not ask?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Or is it that God sees the need, and He cannot meet the need, until the prayer is made?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The cycle of prayer moves in this wise: 1 God wants a thing done; 2 He moves the believer to pray that that thing might be done; 3 God does it in answer to that prayer....There is a thought abroad in the church: "Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God works so slowly."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He does not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>HE WORKS ACCORDING TO THE PRAYERS OF THE CHURCH, and according as there is co-operation with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Did God work very slowly in Egypt in delivering the bound nation?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He worked for a prolonged season in getting the instrument ready in the wilderness forty years....God's work is rapidly done when the instruments see to it that the divine conditions are fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There must be conformity to the laws of God before God can work; and according to the absolute conformity to God's will and laws there is a fulness of operation.</S>
