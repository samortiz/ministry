   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING THE UNLIMITED ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because Christ is all, the revelation in the Bible concerning Him is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians chapter three reveals that even the dimensions of the universe the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth are Christ v. 18 . No one can tell how wide the universe is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The breadth of the universe is immeasurable and boundless.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The length and height of the universe are also boundless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, due to scientific advancements, man is able to go to the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the human perception, the distance from the earth to the moon is quite far.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, from the perspective of the whole universe, that distance is quite insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe are immeasurable, and all of these dimensions are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians chapter three says that when Christ makes His home in our entire being, we will know what are the breadth, length, height, and depth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not think that our mentality can ever thoroughly apprehend Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In his old age Paul wrote in Philippians 3 that he wanted to "know" Christ v. 10a . Paul knew Christ much more than we do, yet at that time he still wanted to know more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our Lord is all, and He is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE SON BEING THE FATHER, AND THE SON ALSO BEING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because of man's limited mentality, there have been many debates and different interpretations concerning the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the last twenty years, in speaking concerning the experience of life, I often have spoken of the Lord Jesus being the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and I have met opposition because of what I have said.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Someone once attacked me, saying, "How can you say that the Lord Jesus is the Son and also the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can you say that He is the Son and also the Spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I met this opposer ten years ago, I asked him, "If the Father is not the Son, and if the Son is not the Spirit, how can you say that God is triune?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do you have one God or three Gods?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To my surprise he answered, "I have three Gods."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Immediately I warned him, saying, "You must by no means teach this kind of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To say that there are three Gods is heresy."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This incident shows us that if a person has not seen that Christ is all, he will oppose this concept and say that Christ is only the Son and not the Father or the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If this were the case, then Christ would not be all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today, however, we see that in this universe there is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and that the Lord Jesus is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Isa 9:6; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this universe there is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this universe there is the Creator and there are the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our Lord Jesus is not only the Creator but also a creature Col 1:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Concerning this matter, another one also opposed me, saying, "To say that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation is to make Christ a creature, and this is heresy!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is the Creator but not a creature!"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I refuted his argument by showing him that Christ became a man with bones, flesh, and blood, so He was surely a man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Was man created or not?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yes, man was created.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is God the Creator, yet He became a man, a created one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you do not confess that the Lord is a creature, this means that you do not confess that He is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you confess that the Lord Jesus is a man, then since man is a creature, you must confess that He is both a creature and the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is both man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our Christ is all.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When you breathe, you should say, "O Lord, You are my real air."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you go down some stairs, you should say, "O Lord, You are my stairs."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When you see a door, you should say, "O Lord Jesus, You are my door."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you see a window, you should say, "O Lord Jesus, You are my window for fresh air."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Scriptures clearly say that the Lord Jesus is all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only is He all, but He is also "Lord of all" Acts 10:36b .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All comprises all persons, matters, and things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is the Lord of all persons, matters, and things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>CHRIST FILLING ALL</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, Ephesians 1:22b-23 says that the church is "the fullness of the One who fills all in all."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must realize that the fullness here is not Christ but the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must not apply the fullness here to Christ but to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The fullness is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today in Taiwan there is so much rich produce different kinds of grains, fruits, and vegetables, plus chickens, ducks, and other kinds of meat.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These are the riches, not the fullness, of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we take in all these riches as our nourishment, eventually all of us will look healthy and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we may say that we are the fullness of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Similarly, Christ is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we enjoy and assimilate His riches so that they become us, we become the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are not the riches of Christ but the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The riches of Christ are all that Christ is, and when all these riches become us, we become His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Let us come back to the matter of Christ being all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do you see that Christ is all?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Is Christ the reality of the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Is Christ the reality of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The emergence of the dry land from the death waters on the third day in Genesis 1 is a type of Christ who resurrected from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christ is typified not only by the light and the expanse but also by the land, which was raised out of the death waters on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the same chapter you see that the plants, animals, and mankind all came out of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This signifies that life comes out of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Furthermore, the land of Canaan promised by God to His chosen people is a type of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The land of Canaan is surrounded by water the Mediterranean Sea, the Dead Sea, and the Jordan River.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This land, which is two to three thousand feet above sea level, is a type of Christ as the resurrected, transcendent One and as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, we may say that Christ is the real land.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If people had such an enlarged view of Christ as all, then they would not argue, saying that Christ is the Son but not the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They would not say that Christ is the Creator but not a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Bible says that Christ is the Lamb and the Lion.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Is a lion the Creator or a creature?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is true that the Bible says that Christ is the Creator, in whom all things were created Col 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, Christ also became a created one.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He became the Lamb, the Lion, and a vine.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Are these items created things or the Creator?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we had a complete view and saw that Christ is all, then we would not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Christ is indeed all!</S>
