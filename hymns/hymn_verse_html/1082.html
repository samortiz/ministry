<b>1</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>The living of Christ when He sojourned on earth,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>The sixteenth Psalm shows us, was wholly of worth.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>His attitudes, choices, and interests all tell</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>The man who in God's tabernacle may dwell.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>2</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>"Preserve me, O God, for in Thee I confide" -</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>In God He took refuge whate'er did betide.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>"O Thou art my Lord, I've no good beyond Thee" -</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>He spoke in Himself unto God constantly.</span><br>

<b>3</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>"As for all the saints who are dwelling on earth,"</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>To Him they're the people of excellent worth.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Of them He has said He has all His delight -</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>In proving this all the four Gospels unite.</span><br>

<b>4</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>"The Lord is my portion, the Lord is my cup" -</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>For everything He to the Father looked up.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>"The Lord I will bless who my counsel doth give" -</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Himself He denied and by God's word did live.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>5</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>His heart thus was glad and His spirit rejoiced,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>And e'en in His death praise to God could be voiced;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>His soul God would never abandon to hell,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>But in resurrection His body would dwell.</span><br>
</div>
<div style='padding-left:1px; padding-top:8px;'>
<b>6</b> <span style='white-space:nowrap'>God raised Him, and He with God's glory was crowned;</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Then fulness of joy in God's presence He found.</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>E'en now at the Father's right hand is His seat,</span><br>
<span style='white-space:nowrap'>Where flowing forever are pleasures complete.</span><br>
