<H1 CLASS=TITLE>REMEMBERING CHRISTMAS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 28</H2><P>December is right in front of us, and many people will again celebrate Christmas. According to the opinions of many believers, it is a good thing to have a day each year to remember the Savior's birth. I dare not treat the opinions of God's children lightly. However, apart from man's opinion, God's Word, the Bible, is still the only standard and the highest standard. Our concern lies not with what man speaks, but with what God has spoken. This is what we care about. "Thus saith the Lord" is the supreme judge over all things.</P><P>Does the Bible have a command to remember the birth of Christ? If God's children are willing to ask this question, they will receive the shining of God's light. What a pity that so many have forgotten the necessity of asking this question. According to the Bible, during the last supper, the Lord only asked us to remember His death. He did not command us to celebrate Christmas, nor did He command us to celebrate Easter! These things are poison from Roman Catholicism. Only one who believes in the Bible will know that the things God did not command and the things God did command have the same significance.</P><P>Many say, "God never put a stop to the celebration of Christmas." But did God ever command us to observe Christmas? It is sad when Christians search the Scriptures to give a basis for their sin and an occasion to the flesh. They say, "The Bible does not prohibit this, so why can we not do it?" Oh, how I wish that God's children would not speak in this way. May God give us more strength to enable us to say, "How do we dare do what God has not commanded?"</P>
