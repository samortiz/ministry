<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOURTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROPHECIES OF ENCOURAGEMENT</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(6)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Zech. 14:8-11, 16-21</H1><P>The center of the prophecies in chapters twelve through fourteen is Christ as the rejected Messiah coming back to be enthroned. In the two foregoing messages we considered the prophecy concerning Israel's destiny in the great war of Armageddon and in their household salvation. In this message we will first consider the prophecy of encouragement concerning Israel's destiny in the millennium and then make a comparison of two main categories of things in the books of Daniel and Zechariah. Following this, I would like to give a word concerning our need to be brought into the realm of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In the Millennium</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Living Waters Going Forth from Jerusalem</H2><P>In the millennium there will be no thirst. Living waters will go forth from Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea, the Dead Sea, and half of them toward the western sea, the Mediterranean Sea (14:8). This is similar to the record in the book of Ezekiel concerning the living water flowing out of the temple of God (Ezek. 47:1-2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jehovah as Christ Being King<br>over All the Earth</H2><P>In the millennium Jehovah as Christ will be King over all the earth, and He will be the one God and His name the one name (Zech. 14:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Jerusalem Being Raised Up<br>and Dwelling in Her Place</H2><P>Jerusalem will be raised up and will dwell in her place (v. 10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. People Dwelling in Jerusalem,<br>and There Being No More Curse</H2><P>People will dwell in Jerusalem, and there will be no more curse, for Jerusalem will dwell securely (v. 11). Instead of curse, there will be blessing with security.</P>
