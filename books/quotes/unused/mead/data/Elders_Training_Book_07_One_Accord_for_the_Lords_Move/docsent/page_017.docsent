   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT TO PRACTICE WHAT IS BEYOND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SCRIPTURE S TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To say that there are two lines in the Lord s recovery is to go beyond the teaching of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the teaching of God s New Testament economy, there are not two lines.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you stress speaking in tongues above the central line of God s New Testament economy, you are off.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To stress speaking in tongues is not according to the teaching of the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament, Paul, through whom the word was completed, did his best to restrict the speaking in tongues in 1 Corinthians 14 and never promoted it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the entire New Testament there are no verses encouraging the promoting of speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you are promoting speaking in tongues, you go beyond the teaching of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then you will cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must be restricted, limited, within the very realm of the unique teaching of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Otherwise, whatever we do will cause some division.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Restricting the speaking in tongues, as the Apostle Paul did, is different from opposing or stopping the speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We did follow the Apostle Paul to restrict the speaking in tongues, but we never opposed or stopped the proper and genuine speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we did, we were beyond the teaching of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our preaching of the gospel of the Lord Jesus must be restricted within four things the one accord, prayer, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To bring in any gimmick besides these four items is something beyond the teaching of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Temporarily what you do may seem very good and profitable, but for the long run it will produce troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Baptism by immersion is scriptural, but to make this doctrinal point a basis upon which you build your church is beyond the teaching of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The practice of the Baptist churches went beyond this teaching and produced a great denomination with many small divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Baptists themselves are divided into different groups such as the Southern Baptists and the American Baptists.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Presbytery is also according to the Bible, but to make this the ground upon which you build the church is far beyond the teaching of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For a church to set up schools or seminaries is also beyond this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For the church to train the believers, however, is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My point is that we should not bring any practice into the church life in a solid and definite way which is not in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is something beyond the teaching of God s New Testament economy, which will sooner or later cause trouble and bring in divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To emphasize any spiritual gift is beyond the teaching of the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Gifts are in the Bible but we should not make them the emphasis of our teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The saints who say there are two lines in the recovery do not know how risky it is to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul said that they did not do anything that was beyond what was written in the Bible 1 Cor 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Corinthians were puffed up on behalf of one worker against the other.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They said among other things that they were of Paul, which meant that they were proud and puffed up on behalf of Paul against Peter and Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not according to the Scripture s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anything that goes beyond the teachings of the New Testament would damage and jeopardize a person s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The apostle s leading must always be according and limited to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>TEACH WHAT THE APOSTLE TEACHES</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul tells Timothy that he has to learn how to cut straight the word of the truth, how to teach the word properly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To cut straight the word means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He also told Timothy in 2:2 to commit to faithful men the things he had heard from Paul so that these faithful ones would be competent to teach others what Paul had been teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a charge to spread the apostle s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>BE IMITATORS OF THE APOSTLE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>WHO IS THE IMITATOR OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1 Corinthians 11:1 Paul said, Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If anyone does not follow Christ according to the teaching of the New Testament economy, no one among us should follow him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A leading apostle should be one who has an adequate knowledge of the teaching of God s New Testament economy and who follows Christ accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I was young in Christianity, I was taught to follow Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to realize, however, who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Jesus is the Triune God who was incarnated to be a man, lived a human life on this earth, and died on the cross with seven statuses to accomplish an all-inclusive death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was resurrected to be the firstborn of God and the life-giving Spirit to release the divine life to impart Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is now the ascended One in the heavens carrying out His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be an imitator of Christ is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To imitate Christ is not to use our human effort to be humble, nice, and gentle as He was.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a mistaken following of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whoever knows, teaches, and follows Christ in His incarnation, in His human living, in His death, in His resurrection, in His ascension, and in His heavenly ministry, is the one we need to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If I follow this One, then you should follow me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If I am not teaching and following such a One, forget about me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It does not depend upon who I am; it only depends upon what I teach and whom I follow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the churches should be identical, and those who can render the leading to all the churches are the ones who have the adequate knowledge of the teaching of God s New Testament economy and who would pass on these teachings to the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We follow the one who is teaching and following this all-inclusive, incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ who is still ministering in the heavenlies for the carrying out of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to follow such persons and we have to take their leading.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their leading is the proper leading for all the churches.</S>
