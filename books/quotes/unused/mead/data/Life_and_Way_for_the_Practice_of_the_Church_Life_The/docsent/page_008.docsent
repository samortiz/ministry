   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SATAN'S INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By going through the whole Bible in this way we can see what is in God's plan, God's economy, God's arrangement, God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the very thing which the enemy of God hates so much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Throughout all the generations, the enemy has done and is still doing his best to frustrate, to damage, to spoil, and even to disrupt this very matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What Satan, the enemy of God, has always been doing is of two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, if possible, he would hinder, frustrate, and prevent people from coming to the Lord Jesus to receive Him as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Next, if he could not do this, he will allow people to believe in Christ, but he will try to frustrate them from being built up together with others as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The old enemy Satan considers the second matter more serious than the first.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He knows God's intention in the whole universe is to have a house, a Body, a corporate container.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as he can frustrate God from having His house, Satan is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regardless of how much material and how many precious things there are, as long as the house is not there, it is all right with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Look into the history of Christianity and the situation today; then you will realize what the enemy's intention is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The goal, the intention, of Satan is to spoil, to frustrate, and to hinder the building which God desires to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>GOD'S INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have the full assurance that in these last days the Lord is doing something to recover the church life, the building of His Body, the building of His house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The present age is the age of the church, and God's aim, God's goal, is to have a church, to have a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many read the Gospel of John and realize that it says that Christ came that we may have life 3:16; 10:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But they do not know that this life is for the forming of the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 3:29 mentions the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John the Baptist recommended the Lord not only as the Lamb of God 1:29 but also as the Bridegroom who has the bride 3:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ came as the Lamb in order that He might obtain a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We often say that Christ loved us and died on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Galatians 2:20 does tell us that Christ, the Son of God, "loved me and gave Himself up for me."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But do you know that there is also Ephesians 5:25, which says that Christ "loved the church and gave Himself up for her"?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ gave Himself up not just for you but for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ loves you for the purpose of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His intention is to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to spend more time to learn about the twelve aspects of the church which we have pointed out.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Learn to know the church as the universal new man with Christ as the appearance, form, and expression without and with Christ as the life within.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then learn to know the church as the wife, the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Learn to know the church as the wonderful house, the wonderful tabernacle, the wonderful temple, the wonderful city, and the army fighting for the kingdom and interest of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, you have to learn to know the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the corporate vessel, and the corporate lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, you have to know the magnificent city, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you desire to know Christ, you have to know these twelve items.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Otherwise, you cannot know Christ in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE PEARL OF GREAT VALUE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this chapter my burden is to share with you about the church in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do you know that the church in the eyes of the Lord is a pearl?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we have pointed out in the beginning of this chapter, the Lord likened the church to a pearl Matt 13:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A pearl is something transformed in the death waters; it is not something created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that the church is not something natural; it was not there in God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church is something transformed in the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The transformation of the church is something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Most of us know how a pearl is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Originally, a pearl was just a little rock or a grain of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day an oyster is wounded by this little rock and it secretes its life-juice around the little rock.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This secretion transforms the little rock into a wonderful pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is also the story of how the church is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ came to the world which was filled with death, and He was wounded by the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He secreted His life-juice around the sinners to make them into a pearl of great value, which is the church.</S>
