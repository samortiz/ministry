   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Its Contents</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The contents of the tree of knowledge are all things apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even the Bible inspired by God and the law given by God may be utilized in letters by Satan as the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even the experience of Christ that you had today can become the tree of knowledge tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have already illustrated the experience of giving a message on Genesis 3:15 in complete dependence upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That message was very living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose, however, I am invited to speak in another city, and I think to myself, "I gave such a good message on Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I think I'll repeat the same message."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I do this, that message will become the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Two months ago that message was the tree of life; now, once it is repeated in the way of knowledge, it becomes the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may have a similar experience after offering up a living prayer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One night you may be offering up a living prayer in dependence upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because that prayer was excellent and living, you decide to repeat the same prayer, word for word, in the next prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To your surprise, the prayer that once was the tree of life becomes the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, even a living prayer can become the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us take an example from our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Parents often instruct their children by saying, "Don't you see that John is such a good boy?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why don't you act the way he does?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If John's behavior comes from a dependence upon the Lord, it is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If another child imitates John, his imitation is the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to apply this to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we act in a certain way according to life and then repeat that action according to the knowledge derived from our first experience, that repetition becomes the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even the one Bible can be two trees to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you depend on the Lord and exercise your spirit as you touch the Word, the Bible is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, if you exercise your mind and investigate the Bible as a book of letters, it will be the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can make the Bible in letters the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus told the Jews, "You search the Scriptures..you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" John 5:39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To merely search the Scriptures is to come to the tree of knowledge; to contact the Lord through the Word is to come to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Never make the Bible the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Always keep it as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The determining factor is whether or not you are dependent upon the Lord as you come to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are independent of Him, whatever you may get is the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you are dependent upon Him, everything you receive is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should never think that the two trees mentioned in Genesis 2 are ancient history.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Genesis 2 is not an antiquated record; it is a living, up-to-date, divine revelation of two principles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>c Its Nature and Result</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The nature and result of the tree of life are both life because it is a tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the nature and result of the tree of knowledge of good and evil are both death because knowledge, good, and evil are all of death and bring in death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Anything that is not life is of death and results in death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, the tree of knowledge of good and evil is the tree of death; yet it is not called the tree of death, but the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Death is not only behind evil; it is also behind knowledge and good.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The title of the tree of knowledge of good and evil is subtle because Satan always likes to conceal himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Satan has the power of death Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since the tree of knowledge of good and evil is actually the tree of death, it signifies Satan.</S>
