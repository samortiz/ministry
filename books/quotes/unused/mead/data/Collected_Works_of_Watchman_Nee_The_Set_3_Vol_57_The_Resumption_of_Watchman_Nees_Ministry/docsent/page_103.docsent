   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE EXERCISE OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AUTHORITY IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE BODY-CONSCIOUSNESS Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 28, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai THE EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY IN THE BODY Being Restricted in Our Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A man learns restriction first through his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is very difficult for a man to control his tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A tongue that is under control only dares to speak words of the instructed Isa 50:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first thing we have to see is that a person who is rebellious in his speaking is one who has given himself away.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not Speaking Reviling Words</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I was in London, I met a couple who would not submit to the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The husband was a good man, and the wife was also a good sister.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The only trouble was that they were too talkative.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They testified that whenever they spoke contradicting words, their spirit became a contradicting spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to see that our spirit comes out as soon as our words come out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Both 2 Peter and Jude speak of the matter of reviling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Reviling is done through our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are not careful and we revile the brothers ahead of us, the oneness of the church will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Withstanding Reviling Words</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who take in reviling words bear the same responsibility as those who speak reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is one thing for a person to dump trash on others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is another thing for a person to receive trash from others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One of the reasons the church is divided and damaged is that there are reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order for the church to maintain the oneness, the brothers and sisters have to withstand reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Example of Michael</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Michael was an archangel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the beginning he was under Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although Satan fell, Michael did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him even when contending over the body of Moses, which was probably left on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Michael could not revile Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He could only say, "The Lord rebuke you'' Jude 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He had to invoke a higher authority to rebuke Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From this we see the importance of our words.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Reviling Words Damaging the Body</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some people's tongues are "waxed''; they are very cunning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of person does not know or understand the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They unconsciously damage the Body with their words.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is bad enough for a man to have a wound.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if one rubs sand on the wound, the hurt will be greater.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The same is true when one speaks reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a man's tongue is not under control, all other kinds of control are useless James 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man's tongue is the most cunning of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A double-tongued person will soon find that he has no one he can perfect; he will turn away every possible person he can perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are an inquisitive person and one with an itching ear, you want others to talk to you and to entertain you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But those who have learned the lessons should rebuke you to your face.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One need not go on speaking when he is in front of an inquisitive person; his words should stop right there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Need to Know the Body</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The consciousness of sin comes from knowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same way, the consciousness of reviling words comes from the knowledge of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Reviling words are opposed to the testimony of the Body.</S>
