<h2 class="head2">Man's Strong Spot</h2><p>When a man opens his mouth, his spirit is exposed; others will know whether or not he has a right spirit. When the spirit is exposed, the inner condition of a man is also exposed. In listening to someone, the first thing we have to find is his strong spot. We have to ask, "What kind of impression do I have of this man? What part of him is the strongest?" If our spirit is open and pliable before the Lord, it will be sensitive and will detect any conspicuous spots. Once a man opens his mouth, his spirit is exposed. In fact, his whole person is exposed. Those who are strong in their mind will touch others with their mind. Those who are subjective and stubborn will expose their stubbornness as soon as they open their mouth; they immediately will give others this impression. James 3:17 speaks of those who are peaceable and forbearing. It is easy to ask such ones to do something. But others will not yield even when others plead with them for hours. It is hard to ask a subjective and strong-willed person for anything. Then there are those who are very strong in their emotion. Others can sense this as well. A person who is strong in his emotion is easily influenced by others. When he speaks about love, he is not necessarily speaking about what is truly love. If our spirit is pure and meek, we will easily touch others' conspicuous spots. These conspicuous spots are actually the trouble spots; they are the areas that need to be dealt with. We must not only touch others' spirit with our spirit, but we must touch the conspicuous spots with our spirit. We have to know the kind of people with whom we are dealing.</p><h2 class="head2">A Closed Spirit</h2><p>Generally speaking, when we speak to a brother, we can touch his spirit. But sometimes a man's spirit will not come out. We may speak to him for a long time, but we cannot sense his spirit. His real person is hidden, and we do not know what is happening within him. His real person is so deeply hidden that we cannot tell his true condition. Such a one has great problems. God's children should be very approachable. We should live according to the principle of "amen." When a person does something or says something, our inner being should be able to respond with an "amen." This is right. But some people are always hidden behind or within their outer man; they cannot produce an "amen" in others. They are very secretive. No one knows them, and they have fellowship with no one. This is a dangerous position to be in. These ones are so individualistic that others cannot touch their genuine person. As a result they are cut off from the fellowship of the Body. Christians should be deep, but at the same time, they have to be genuine in their expression. They have to allow others to touch their spirit. Those who do not allow others to touch their spirit are cut off from the fellowship. They have not learned the proper lessons of the Body and know nothing about fellowship. Some people have been Christians for eight or ten years, yet others cannot touch their spirit at all. Their spirit is a closed spirit. We have to test whether a man's spirit can be touched by others. If it cannot be touched, something is wrong with that person. In the world, a person can be as subtle as possible. Christians, however, should not be this way; their spirit should be open and free to fellowship with others.</p><h2 class="head2">An Abnormal Person</h2><p>When a person speaks, we should listen carefully. The words may tell us whether the speaker has a strong spirit, a conspicuous mind, or a subjective disposition. Although some are particularly strong in some areas, on the whole they still may be proper persons. Some are particularly strong in their emotion. This is not uncommon. However, there are those who are not only exceptionally strong in their mind and emotion but different to the point of being abnormal. When we contact such ones, we cannot deal with them according to ordinary means. They are distorted, peculiar, and extreme in their mentality. Their psychology is different from that of ordinary men. They are warped. Such ones are not few in number. Among a hundred persons, one always can find a few who are altogether abnormal. Their thoughts and behavior are completely different from ordinary men, and their will is always at odds with others. Such ones become a problem to others. They cannot be tackled in the usual way. They must be dealt with severely by special means. The very constitution of their being is warped. If we employ ordinary means and try to exhort them twenty times, they will come back and disappoint us twenty times. They are set in their character already. Our eyes should be opened to such odd personalities.</p>
