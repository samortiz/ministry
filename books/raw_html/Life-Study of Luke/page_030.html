<h1 class="series"> LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE PREPARATION OF THE MAN-SAVIOR<br />IN HIS HUMANITY WITH HIS DIVINITY</h1><h1 class="title">(8)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 3:21-22; 4:1-13</h1><h2 class="head1">SOME OF THOSE INVOLVED<br />IN THE PREPARATION OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</h2><h2 class="head2">The Archangel Gabriel</h2><p>In the first three and a half chapters of the Gospel of Luke we see that two angels and a number of human beings were involved in the preparation of the Man-Savior. In 1:30-35 we have the prophecy of the archangel Gabriel, who came to Mary and told her that God intended that she conceive the Man-Savior. In that prophecy Gabriel spoke of four matters concerning the coming Man-Savior. First, Gabriel said that the Man-Savior would be called Jesus (1:31), which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah. Second, Gabriel indicated that the coming Man-Savior would be called Son of the Most High (v. 32), a title that refers to His deity. Third, Gabriel said, &ldquo;The Lord God will give to Him the throne of David His father&rdquo; (v. 32). Here we see that in His humanity the coming Savior was to be a descendant of David. Fourth, the archangel Gabriel refers to the coming Savior as &ldquo;the holy thing&rdquo; which is to be born and who will be called Son of God (v. 35). Therefore, according to Gabriel&rsquo;s word, the Man-Savior is Jesus, the Son of the Most High, a descendant of David, and the holy thing.</p><h2 class="head2">Elizabeth</h2><p>In 1:42 and 43 we have part of Elizabeth&rsquo;s blessing, a blessing by the Holy Spirit. In these verses Elizabeth says, &ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And how can this be, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?&rdquo; Here Elizabeth speaks of the Man-Savior as the fruit of Mary&rsquo;s womb and as the Lord. The &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; refers to His humanity, and &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; refers to His deity.</p><h2 class="head2">Zachariah</h2><p>In the prophecy of Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist, we have three matters concerning the Man-Savior. In 1:69 Zachariah speaks of Him as a &ldquo;horn of salvation for us in the house of David.&rdquo; Then in 1:78 he speaks of Him as &ldquo;the rising sun from on high&rdquo; that shall visit us. In verse 76 Zachariah also refers to the Man-Savior as the Lord. The horn of salvation refers to the Lord&rsquo;s humanity; the rising sun from on high denotes His divinity. Zachariah knew that his son, John, would prepare the way for this One, who is the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Another Angel</h2><p>In 2:11 we have the angel&rsquo;s announcement at the birth of the Man-Savior: &ldquo;A Savior was born to you today in David&rsquo;s city, who is Christ the Lord.&rdquo; In the angel&rsquo;s announcement the Man-Savior is mentioned as being the Savior, Christ, and the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Simeon</h2><p>More aspects of the Man-Savior are revealed in Simeon&rsquo;s adoration of Him. In 2:25, 30-32 and 34 we see that the Man-Savior is revealed as the consolation of Israel, God&rsquo;s salvation to all peoples, a light for the Gentiles, the glory of Israel, a test to Israel, and a sign spoken against.</p><h2 class="head2">Anna</h2><p>Finally, we have Anna&rsquo;s adoration. In her adoration there is mention of the Man-Savior as the redemption of God&rsquo;s people (2:38).</p>
