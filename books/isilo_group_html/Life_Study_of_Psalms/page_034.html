Asking Jehovah to Arise in His Anger<br>against the Overflowing Wrath of His Enemies</H2><P>David asked Jehovah to arise in His anger against the overflowing wrath of his enemies, and asked Jehovah to judge him according to his righteousness and integrity (Psa. 7:6-8). It is hard to imagine that such a godly man as David would pray such a prayer. He asked God to judge him according to his righteousness and integrity. Where was his integrity? He had committed fornication and murder, issuing in the rebellion of his son. As we consider Psalms 3&#151;7 in this light, we can see how blind we have been in our appreciation of the Psalms.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>15. Asking God to Establish the Righteous Man</H2><P>David asked God to establish the righteous man and believed that his shield was with God, who, as a righteous Judge, saves the upright in heart (Psa. 7:9-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>16. Believing That the Evil Man<br>Travails in Iniquity and Digs a Pit</H2><P>David believed that the evil man travails in iniquity and digs a pit, hollowing it out and falling into the hole, his mischief returning upon his own head (Psa. 7:14-16). I say again, suppose that a brother prayed this way in a prayer meeting. The saints might ask him to stop.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>17. Giving Thanks to Jehovah<br>according to His Righteousness<br>and Singing Praise to the Name<br>of Jehovah the Most High</H2><P>David gave thanks to Jehovah according to His righteousness and sang praise to the name of Jehovah the Most High (Psa. 7:17). This is one of the few good points in Psalms 3&#151;7. Thank the Lord that these psalms have a good ending.</P><P>However, we can see that there is nothing in Psalms 3&#151;7 concerning God's economy, God's kingdom, and God's interest. There is nothing concerning Christ. There is no real interceding spirit, that is, no intercession for others in the spirit. Also, there is very little life supply to the readers. Instead, these psalms encourage, strengthen, and confirm the readers in asking God to take care of them and their interest. Many readers of the Psalms, who read without the proper discernment of the human concept and the divine concept, have been encouraged to take care of their benefit and their interest.</P><P>After considering Psalms 3&#151;7 in the light of God's New Testament economy, we can see that these psalms should not be taken as models for our prayer. In them we see David's sufferings, his desire to be avenged of his adversaries, and his self-righteousness. We do not see any repentance, confession of his fault, or self-condemnation. Psalm 8, however, reveals Christ's incarnation, His death and resurrection, His ascension, and His kingdom. Psalms 3&#151;7 reveal David's concepts concerning a godly life, whereas Psalm 8 is his inspired praise of the excellency of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
