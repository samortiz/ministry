   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Joseph Being a Type of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Joseph's biography indicates that he had no defects.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the record, he was altogether perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible Joseph is the perfect one in the Old Testament, and Jesus is the perfect One in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The four biographies of Jesus in the New Testament reveal that He was perfect, without defect.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The record of Joseph in the Old Testament reveals that he also was perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some may say that in order to be a type of Christ, Joseph had to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But was not David a type of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Certainly he was.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But David, a type of Christ, committed gross sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Solomon also was a type of Christ, but he too was sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With the exception of Joseph, all the personal types of Christ in the Old Testament had some shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a type of Christ, Joseph signifies the reigning aspect of a matured saint, the mature Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Certainly the reigning aspect of such a person must be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>None of us, of course, is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, in our reigning aspect we are perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we are reigning in the spirit, we are perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, you may say, "I am not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, I am like Judah."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the aspect of you which is like Judah is not your reigning aspect, but your fallen aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes, according to your fallen aspect you are like Judah in chapter thirty-eight.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both chapters thirty-seven and thirty-nine are chapters of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Chapter thirty-eight, on the contrary, is a chapter of perversion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the reigning aspect is in chapter thirty-seven and the fallen aspect in chapter thirty-eight.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps yesterday you were reigning for God, but today you may have committed sin, even a gross sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This reveals the fact that we have various aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this message we shall deal only with the reigning aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that we all shall see that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph are one person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Joseph is not a separate aspect of a complete spiritual person as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, as we have seen, Joseph is an aspect of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible does not say that God is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, and the God of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This would make God quaternary instead of triune.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are only three.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when we come in Jacob to the stage of maturity, we see that with the mature life there is the reigning aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Neither Abraham nor Isaac reigned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But Joseph reigned representatively for Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, Jacob reigned through Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1:26, when God created man, He said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion..."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the last few chapters of Genesis we see an Israel expressing God's image and exercising His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The exercise of God's dominion over all things is manifested in Joseph's life, whereas God's image is expressed in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Joseph is not separate from Jacob, but is an aspect of the life that expresses God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The two aspects of expressing God's image and exercising God's dominion must be found in one person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, what is found in Joseph's life may be called the reigning aspect of the matured Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without this light, you will not be able to understand this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sorry to say, most Christians do not have this light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our goal must be to express God with His image and to represent Him with His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this, we are chosen and fallen as Jacob; we are called, we are justified, and we live by faith as Abraham; we inherit the riches of Christ and enjoy them as Isaac; and finally we struggle, we suffer, we are dealt with, and we reach maturity as Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all have the "Jacobean" struggling nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we were told not to struggle, we would struggle just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Struggling, however, is not necessarily wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If one has been a Christian for years but has never struggled, it means that he is not one who is seeking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It also means that he is not interested in gaining the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But once we realize something about the birthright, we shall struggle to be holy and spiritual, and our "Jacobean" struggling nature will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you struggle, be prepared to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Along with the suffering, you will be under God's dealing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may be smart, but God has a Laban who is smarter than you are.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Be prepared to suffer and to be dealt with by the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually you will reach maturity, and the reigning aspect of the matured Israel will be seen in your life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the reigning aspect represented by Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Again I say, Joseph is not a complete person, but simply an aspect of a matured saint who has passed through the experiences represented by the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After passing through all these experiences, the matured saint has an aspect that is constituted solely of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because this aspect of him is the constitution of Christ, it is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Joseph represents this constituted aspect of a matured saint.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In each of us there is a part that is constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even if you have just been regenerated, a part of you, your regenerated spirit, has been constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the beginning of Christ's constitution in you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The process of being constituted of Christ will continue until it reaches its climax when the reigning aspect comes forth in you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When you are fully matured, you will have this top portion, this top aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the constitution of Christ, an aspect of the mature life constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No doubt, Joseph is the perfect type of Christ because he portrays the constituted aspect of a mature saint.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the aspect of you which is constituted of Christ is not perfect, then surely no part of you could be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In us who are fallen, saved, called, redeemed, and regenerated there is nothing perfect except the constituting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hallelujah, we have Christ's constitution within us!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I repeat, Joseph represents the constitution of Christ in Jacob's mature life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This aspect, Christ constituted in the matured saints, is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, it perfectly typifies Christ.</S>
