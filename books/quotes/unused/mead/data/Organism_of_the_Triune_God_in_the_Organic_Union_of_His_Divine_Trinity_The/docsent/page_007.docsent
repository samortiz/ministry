   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The organic union which is of the divine Trinity is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Outside of Christ there is no organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we were saved, we believed into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we entered into Christ, we became identified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever we eat something, what we eat becomes identified with us, and we become identified with it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I eat some chicken, the chicken gets inside of me and it becomes me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I become identified with the chicken that I eat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Dietitians tell us that we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We become what we eat, and what we eat becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the Greek language, to believe in the Lord is actually to believe into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we believed into the Lord Jesus, we became identified with Him, and in this sense we became Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Christ s death, He identified the redeemed ones with Himself Rom 6:8a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to this truth, to say that we are one with Jesus is not as accurate as saying that we became Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The all-inclusive death of Christ includes us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We died with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to Romans 6:6, our old man has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ terminated us when He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be crucified means to be terminated, to be ended.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we believed into the Lord Jesus, we became identified with Him and we were terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our history was ended.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To believe into the Lord Jesus is not only to be included in Him but also to be ended in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our believing into Him was a kind of suicide for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I believed into the Lord Jesus, I was terminated, and my past history came to an end. The formula for our organic union was that we believed into Christ and were included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this including we were terminated, and this was a preparation for us to enjoy the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The organic union of the divine Trinity is firstly in the death of Christ and then in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the third day after His death, Christ was raised from among the dead 1 Cor 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were also included in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In His death we were terminated, and in His resurrection we were enlivened Eph 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For Jesus to be crucified and enlivened took about three days.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For us who believed into Him, to be crucified and enlivened was instantaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the very second that we called O Lord Jesus, we were crucified and enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By calling O Lord Jesus, our former history ended because our old history was terminated and buried in the tomb, and a new history began.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our old life was ended, and we were living a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the sixties, some hippies were saved among us and we saw a great change take place in them because of their organic union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Calling O Lord Jesus terminated their former history, the history of a hippie, and began another history, the history of a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As persons who had believed into Christ, they were persons in Christ, identified with Christ, which means that they became Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is what happens when the organic union transpires within a person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although this organic union is invisible, it is a wonderful reality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we were identified with Christ in His resurrection, we were both enlivened and raised up Eph 2:5-6a .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This organic union is not only in Christ s death and resurrection but also in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In His ascension He seated us together with Him in the heavenlies Eph 2:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to have the realization that we are now in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are in the heavenlies because we are in Christ, who is in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is our aircraft.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If I am in the aircraft and the aircraft is in the air, then I am in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ephesians 2 tells us that we have been saved by grace v. 8 . Many Christians think that this merely means that we were not saved by our work but by His redemption, His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Actually, to be saved by grace is to be saved by His death, by His resurrection, and by His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many Christians are expecting to go to heaven, but they do not realize that they were in the heavenlies already.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the very moment we believed into the Lord Jesus and called upon His name, we were in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is because we became identified with Him by believing into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are still persons living and moving on this earth, but many times we have the deep sensation that we are in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At those times the earthly things cannot touch us because we are transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are far above all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The other members of our family may be bothered by certain things, but we are soaring above them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are transcendent because we are people in the heavenlies in the organic union in Christ through His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
