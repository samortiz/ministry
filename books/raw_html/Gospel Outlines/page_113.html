<h1 class="title">HE THAT COMETH SHALL NOT BE CAST OUT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 6:37</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>One great big word&mdash;COME
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He often uttered this word: come. Come and find rest. Come and have life. The Lord is always calling us to come.</li>
	<li>To come is to draw nigh to the Lord, to call on Him, and to believe in the Lord.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The need of coming
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because of sin there is a need of coming. The sinners need to come to have their sins forgiven.</li>
	<li>Because of burden there is a need of coming. You should point out the many burdens of this life.</li>
	<li>Because of perdition there is a need of coming.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to come
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Come with your sins. Do not wait until you improve yourself. Do not wait until you get rid of all your sins. Do not wait until your conscience does not bother you anymore.</li>
	<li>Come with your burden.</li>
	<li>Come as you are. Do not wait until you improve yourself. It would be good to sing the hymn &ldquo;Just As I Am.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Come according to the word of the Lord. The Lord is calling us to come. So when we come, we do not have to be afraid that we are coming without an invitation. The Lord says, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; You reply, &ldquo;Amen, I come.&rdquo;</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s promise<br />
<span class="normal"><em>Emphasize this strongly.</em></span>
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In this universe there is at least one promise made by the Lord for us, as sinners: &ldquo;Him that comes to Me I will by no means cast out.&rdquo; This is not only a definite word, but also a promise. It is neither guessing, nor postulating. It is firm and cannot be changed. Whatever can be changed is not a promise.</li>
	<li>Even a gentleman will fulfill what he has promised. How much more shall this faithful Lord fulfill His own promise.</li>
	<li>In this sentence there are three words: &ldquo;by no means.&rdquo; These words mean that it does not matter what your condition is. When someone is coming to the Lord, he often hesitates because of his poor condition. The Lord said, &ldquo;Him that comes to me I will by no means cast out.&rdquo; He did not say, &ldquo;Him that comes to me must be in good condition so that I will not forsake him.&rdquo; Once when Dr. Torrey was preaching the gospel, one among the audience asked him, &ldquo;Will the Lord not even forsake one like me?&rdquo; Dr. Torrey used this verse to help him get saved. <em>You should emphasize the words &ldquo;by no means.&rdquo;</em> Men must believe &ldquo;by no means&rdquo; firmly and never doubt, then they will be saved.</li>
