<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. INDWELLING THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The all-inclusive Spirit is indwelling the believers (Rom. 8:11). The Spirit not only dwells within us but also indwells us. To indwell is to make home, or reside (cf. Eph. 3:17). Today the Spirit is within us, and He is functioning to indwell us.</P><P>All of the functions of the all-inclusive Spirit are very mysterious and abstract. In each believer all these functions are acting day by day. The world does not see this, but we believers can realize the functions of the Spirit. This is because these functions are actions. The Spirit is moving within us every day, even every moment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. LEADING THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>This indwelling Spirit is the leading Spirit. He leads the believers (Rom. 8:14; Gal. 5:18). Romans 8:14 says that as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. We are the sons of God because we have a particular Guide, who leads us always in a particular way. Whatever the Spirit tells us in His leading of us is true. We have to listen to Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. WITNESSING</H2><P>The Spirit also functions in witnessing, or testifying. First, He witnesses concerning Christ (John 15:26; 1 John 5:6). While the gospel preaching is going on, the Spirit is always working within the listeners in the way of witnessing. This is why many unbelievers wonder why certain preachers are so convincing. Actually, it is not they who are convincing. While they are speaking, another One, a witnessing person, the witnessing Spirit, is working in the listeners. Actually, the witnessing Spirit within the listeners speaks more than the speaker who is witnessing concerning Christ. Otherwise, how could people such as the conservative Chinese ever believe in Jesus? Logically speaking, this is impossible. But whenever a witness of Christ is speaking about Christ, another Witness, the Spirit, works to witness concerning Christ within the listeners.</P><P>Also, the Spirit witnesses with the spirit of the believers that they are children of God (Rom. 8:16). How do we know we are children of God? We know because there is an inner witnessing, and that witnessing is the witnessing Spirit with our spirit. The two spirits work together. Some who become fallen or defeated in their Christian life may go to a sinful place. But when they go, there is a checking within them which says, "Should a child of God be here?" The witnessing Spirit with our spirit is witnessing all the time, but many Christians are not used to listening to this inward witness. When we go shopping, there is always an inward checking, an inward witnessing, telling us that certain things are not what children of God should buy. In everything we do, we have the witnessing Spirit functioning within us.</P>
