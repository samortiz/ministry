<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THREE TYPES OF ANTICHRIST</H2><P>Antiochus Epiphanes was a type of Antichrist. The first type of Antichrist was Nimrod in Genesis; the second was Antiochus Epiphanes in Daniel; and the third was Titus, the prince of Rome who destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Thus, if we want a full picture of Antichrist, we need to study not only the book of Revelation but also these three types of Antichrist. With Nimrod, Antiochus Epiphanes, and Titus we have the picture, and in the book of Revelation we have the definition. When we put together the picture and the definition, we have a full view concerning Antichrist.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONTROLLING VISION<br>KEEPING GOD'S PEOPLE FROM THE WORLD</H2><P>I hope that we will all see the controlling vision in the second chapter of Daniel and that, in light of this vision, we will have a clear view regarding human government. In the eyes of human beings, there are different kinds of governments, some good and others bad. But in the eyes of God, every human government is a beast. Babylon, Persia, Greece, the Roman Empire&#151;all are beasts. I can testify that this view has preserved me from the world for more than sixty years. We all need such a view, such a vision. If, as God's people, we see this controlling vision, we will be kept from the world and prepared for Christ's coming as the smiting stone which will crush the aggregate of human government and become a great mountain&#151;the eternal kingdom of God&#151;filling the whole earth.</P>
