   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRINCIPLES OF MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How should we meet?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first principle in the Bible concerning meetings is that all meetings are conducted in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matthew 18:20 says, "Gathered into My name," which can also be translated as, "Gathered under My name."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What does it mean to be gathered under the Lord's name?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It means to be under the Lord's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord is the center, and everyone is drawn to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not go to a meeting to visit certain brothers or sisters, nor do we go because we are attracted by certain brothers or sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We go to the meeting to be gathered together with other saints under the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not meet to listen to someone's preaching but to meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you meet to listen to someone's preaching, I am afraid you are coming under that person's name, not under the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes, men's names are used to attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to draw men under that person's name.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the Lord says that we have to meet under His name.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should come under the Lord's name because the Lord is not with us in a physical sense Luke 24:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever the Lord is not physically present, there is the need of His name.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord is physically present, there is less of a need for His name.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The name is present because the person Himself is not present.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As far as His physical body is concerned, the Lord is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet He has left us with a name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord has promised that if we meet under His name, He will be in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that His Spirit will be in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the Lord is sitting in heaven, His name is still in our midst, and His Spirit is also in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit is the One who upholds the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Holy Spirit is the guardian of Christ's name; He protects and guards the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Wherever there is the name of the Lord, there is the Holy Spirit, and there the Lord's name is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who want to meet must meet under the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second principle of meeting is that its goal should be for the building up of others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul told us that the basic principle of meeting is to build up others, not ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything in the meeting should be for the purpose of building up others, not ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Tongue speaking builds up the speaker, but the interpretation of tongues builds up others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other words, every move that builds up just one person is in the principle of tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The principle of the interpretation of tongues is to dispense into others what we ourselves have been built up with, that others may also be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why there should not be any tongue-speaking in the meeting if no one can interpret the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one should speak anything that builds up himself and not others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, we must consider others when we meet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not how much we say, but whether or not what we say builds up others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether or not sisters can ask questions in the meeting is determined by the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Asking questions in the meeting is not just for one's own benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is a matter of whether or not the meeting would be dragged down by such questions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do you want to help the meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The clearest indication of whether or not a man's individuality has been dealt with is seen in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some only think of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They have a message in their heart which they want to preach, and they must speak it when they come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They have a hymn in their heart which they like to sing, and they will do anything to find an opportunity to sing it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They do not care whether the message will help the meeting or whether the hymn will enliven the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This kind of person brings nothing but damage to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some brothers have been Christians for years, yet they still do not know how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They care little for heaven or earth, the Lord or the Holy Spirit; they only care about themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They seem to think that as long as they are present, even alone, they can have a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In their eyes, none of the brothers and sisters exist; they are the only ones who are present.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is truly arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When they speak in the meeting, they want to speak until they are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the end they are the only ones who are happy; the other brothers and sisters are all unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They feel that they have a "burden" which must be released.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But as soon as they open their mouths, others are forced to pick up this "burden" and take it home with them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some like long prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When they pray, others become tired.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When someone breaks the principles of the meeting, the whole church suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must not offend the Holy Spirit in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once we offend the Holy Spirit, all the blessing is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the meeting, if we take care of the needs of others and try to build up others, the Holy Spirit will be honored.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He will do the building up work, and we will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, if we do not build up others but talk loosely and offend the Holy Spirit, our meeting will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we meet, we should not think of getting something out of the meeting for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All the activities should be for the benefit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you think your speaking will benefit others, you should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you think your silence will benefit others, remain silent.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Always try to take care of others; this is the basic principle of meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This does not mean that everyone should be silent in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many times speaking damages others, but silence also damages others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you do not care for others, the meeting will suffer whether you speak or remain quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Your speaking must be for the benefit of the meeting, and your silence must also be for the benefit of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Always seek the building up of others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Those who should speak should not remain silent.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the meeting, please remember, "Let all things be done for building up" 1 Cor 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Everyone should come to the meeting with a goal in mind he is there for others, not just for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should never do anything that will stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If our silence will stumble others, we should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If our speaking will stumble others, we should be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We need to learn to speak for the purpose of building up others, and we need to learn to be silent also for the purpose of building up others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whatever we do, it is for the purpose of building up others, not ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we are not for ourselves, we will end up being built up ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But when we think only of ourselves, we will not receive any building up.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If you are not sure whether your speaking will build up others, the best thing to do is to check with more experienced brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You should ask them, "Do you think I should speak more or less in the meeting?"</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You have to learn to be a humble person from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Do not think that you are "somebody."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Do not think that you can sing and preach well and that you are great.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Please do not make any judgment about yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The best thing to do is to ask the experienced brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Check with them to see whether your speaking builds up others.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Speak more if they encourage you to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Speak less if they remind you to speak less.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Our meeting will be high if everyone humbles himself to learn from others.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When this happens, others will sense that God is in our midst when they come in. This is the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I hope we will pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we do, our meeting will glorify God.</S>
