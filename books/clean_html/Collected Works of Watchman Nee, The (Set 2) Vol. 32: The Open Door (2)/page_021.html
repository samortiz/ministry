<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>We have received Issue Nos. 1&mdash;6 of The Open Door. Through this publication, which is filled with God's love, we have learned with much rejoicing about the meetings, the work, and the situations of the brothers and sisters in all these places! The assembly in Penang now has about forty members with over thirty breaking bread together. In January Brother Faithful Luk came and conducted an evangelistic revival meeting. We witnessed an abundant blessing from the Lord. On April 1 Brother Watchman Nee passed through on his way to Europe, and through him we again received the Lord's grace. He stayed for a few days and spoke to us about the truth. All the children of the Lord received much edification. Thank and praise the Lord! After reading the book Rethinking Our Work (The Normal Christian Church Life), we all wish to obey God's will in one accord and to act according to the principle of the Bible. May the Lord grant us grace, and may you pray much for us. Enclosed please find X dollars to be used for the apostolic work in the pioneering endeavor in remote regions. Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Chang Ke-shu, May 4</p><h2 class="head2">Surabaya, Indonesia</h2><p>Sister Ruth:</p><p>I received your letter dated April 21 through Singapore and learned of all the news from it. In times of difficulty, brothers and sisters are more precious to us than before. "A friend loveth at all times,/and a brother is born for adversity." May the Lord's grace be with you in your traveling. My wife and I arrived in Surabaya on May 3. It is very difficult to get permission from the Dutch government to work. I intend to go to Singapore at the end of June and perhaps to Hong Kong at the end of July. Four of my children are in Hong Kong, one is in Singapore, and the youngest is with me. Presently, I do not know where I will be staying. My Singapore address is: Leland Wang, 13 Jerrois Road, Singapore, S.S. My address in Hong Kong is: 6 Kwong King Terrace, Bonham Road, Hong Kong. My parents are now in Hong Kong. Brother Wilson Wang's family arrived in Singapore on May 13. If Sister Miao can come to Singapore, I would be delighted to meet her. Please inform me ahead of time. Greetings to Sister Yun and Sister Peace Wang. Peace to you.</p><p>Brother Leland Wang, May 17</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS&mdash;<br />(WHEREABOUTS OF DIFFERENT SAINTS)</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>Thank the Lord that we can still publish this issue in Hankow! If the readers cannot send their letter to Hankow, they can send it to either Mrs. Yuan How-tsai in Chungking or Brother Ho Nai-yee in Hong Kong. They have been charged by this magazine to serve the brothers and sisters in the Lord. We hope that we can continue our work in Hankow. Should this become impossible, we will tell you where we will be when we have settled down.</p><p>There are more pages in this issue than before. Some of the letters are from faraway places and are very sincere. Some tell of moves and changes as a result of the political turmoil. Some are comforting reports, while others are disturbing reports. I intended to start a column on supplication and thanksgiving, but there are too many pages already, and I had to give up. I hope that the readers will read through the whole magazine so that they will know what to make supplication for and what to give thanks for.</p><p>The addresses of the co-workers are recorded in the column "Footsteps of the Co-workers."</p><p>If you have any question regarding Bible exposition, please send it to the editor of The Christian. This magazine does not deal with that kind of subject. "Questions and Answers," as seen in Issue No. 2, has to do with the church meetings and is different in nature. We wish to remind the readers that the emphasis of this magazine is on the work of the gospel and the practice of the church.</p><p>Wire transfers to Tsingtao have now been cleared. Mail to Shu County and Chou County is still not clear. We have received letters from northern Kiangsu; they are in much difficulty. Presently, we are doing all we can.</p><p>Fukien and Kwangtung are in much turmoil. Many have difficulty taking refuge in Hong Kong. The Lord has to open up the way for the brothers and sisters who are moving inland from Hankow to Szechuan and Hunan. In the past the Lord prevented these refugee brothers and sisters from becoming homeless through the love of many. In the future He will also lead them through His miracles. Our God is also our Father. He is the One who is both the beginning and the end! As I am writing this, I cannot help but have mixed feelings of comfort and apprehension, and my tears freely follow my pen!</p><p>Ruth Lee, at a village in Wan County<br />July 2, 1938</p><p>Correction by Chang Tze-jieh: In Issue No. 7 I wrote about the man who was sick for eighteen years who started to walk. He is not completely healed yet and is still lying on his bed. I make this clarification so that words will not become exaggerated.</p>
