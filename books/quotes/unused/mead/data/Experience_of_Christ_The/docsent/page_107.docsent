   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING THE POWER OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we would know how to die, we must also see that we have a powerful life within us and that this life is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second Corinthians 13:3 says, "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is not weak in us; He is powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the powerful One.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This powerful One is actually the power of resurrection spoken of in Philippians 3:10.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ Himself is the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you take away Christ, resurrection has no power.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hallelujah, today this power of life is in us!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Philippians 3:10 and 11, we firstly have the power of resurrection, secondly the conformity to Christ's death, and thirdly the attaining unto the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the sequence is resurrection, death, resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our experience, which comes first, death or resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have already pointed out that death is the threshold of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, death must be first.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in these verses resurrection comes before death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 6 says that we are baptized into Christ's death and indicates that the power of resurrection follows death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Philippians 3 death is implied by the fact that Paul counted all things loss.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul's counting all things loss was actually his experience of remaining in the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because he remained in death, the power of Christ's resurrection could rise up in him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the way to know the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way to know the life power in a grain of wheat is to put that grain into the soil and keep it there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Likewise, in order to know Christ as the power of resurrection life within us, we need to remain in Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we remain in His death, the power of life will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the power of life rises up, it will bring us into deeper death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This deeper death is the conformity to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The day we were baptized we were merely put into Christ's death; we were not yet conformed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, when sisters bake a cake, they put the dough into a mold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But after the dough is put into the mold, it is pressed and processed until it conforms to the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, to put the dough into the mold is one thing, and to conform it to the mold is another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we were baptized, we were put into the death of Christ, but we were not molded to the form of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we are willing to remain in His death, the power of resurrection will rise up within us and bring us deeper and deeper into death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not being baptized into His death, but being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to say, "Lord, how I thank You for Your wonderful death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To stay here is not a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How sweet and pleasant it is to remain in Your death!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When someone gives me a difficult time, I would like to remain in this death and sing hymns of praise unto You."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we remain in Christ's death in such a way, we shall have resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more resurrection we have, the more death we shall experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, the out-resurrection, the outstanding resurrection, will be ours.</S>
