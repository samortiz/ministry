   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Helping Them to Write Down Their Names</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the meeting, help them write down their names if there is the need for them to leave their names.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Help them write if they do not know how to write.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If some ask why they should leave their names, say, "We want your name so that we can come and visit you."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Write out their addresses clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Mark down the area, the street, and the street numbers of their homes so that others can find them when they want to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>F. Leading Them to Pray</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have helped them up to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But your job is not completed yet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You still have to lead them to pray with you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you cannot make it by yourself, ask other brothers or sisters to help you pray with them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Never be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Work on them until you feel at peace to send them home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>G. Bringing Saints Along to Visit Them</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>until They Are Saved</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After your friends have gone home, you have to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first time you visit, you should bring one or two brothers or sisters along with you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is part of your job.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the church arranges for visitation, you have to accompany the brothers and sisters to your friends' house and talk to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not enough for certain people to hear the gospel once.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have to invite them a second and third time until they are finally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May the Lord help us take the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should consider the gospel meeting a very important meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this meeting every brother and sister has something to do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone is living; no one is lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everyone is active.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once such an atmosphere is raised up, the church will have a great turn, and the gospel meeting will become a working meeting for the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the number of people in a local church is small and the format of the meeting simple, one does not have to follow all the details given above.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in principle, every brother and sister should have great regard for the gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everyone is responsible, and everyone should actively advance the gospel and bring people to salvation in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1 Corinthians 10 and 11 the Bible speaks of two things concerning the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Paul speaks of the bread in 11:24, he refers to the Lord's physical body, saying, "And having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ's body was given up for us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through this our sins were forgiven, and we obtained life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The basic thought in this verse is to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Corinthians 10:17 provides another view, saying, "Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The bread in chapter eleven denotes the Lord's physical body, while the bread in chapter ten denotes us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, chapter eleven emphasizes our remembrance of the Lord, while chapter ten emphasizes our fellowship among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we see two significant aspects of the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One is upward towards heaven; we remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Another is centered on the bread on the table, which signifies us, the children of God, having fellowship with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Each one of us has a part in this bread.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are all part of this one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have received the Lord and so have I. This entitles us to the same fellowship in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, the breaking of bread signifies our coming to the Lord to fellowship with Him, as well as our coming together in fellowship with the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every bread-breaking meeting should have two sections, because there are two parts to our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the first part of our salvation, we discovered that we were sinners, destined for judgment and death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the Lord had mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He came to this earth and died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord saved us and shed His blood to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our sins were forgiven once we accepted the Lord Jesus' blood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the first part of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But salvation does not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After we are saved, the Lord Jesus becomes ours and we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He brings us before God and makes His Father our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Holy Spirit within also teaches us to cry, "Abba, Father!"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rom 8:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the second part of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In other words, the first section of salvation has to do with the Lord, and the second section has to do with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the first section we are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the second section we are accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we are saved, we become related to the Lord; this is the first part of the story.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the second part we become related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We approach the Lord from the position of being a sinner, and through Him we come to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First we meet the Lord, and then we meet the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is why the Bible says, "Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also" 1 John 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Salvation has to do with the Son; it is something to do with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Salvation also has to do with the Father; this is something that has to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No one can come to the Father except through the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>First we have to come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>First we must come to the cross to receive forgiveness, to have the righteous One take the place of the unrighteous, before we can be brought by the Lord to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, we do not come to the Father to receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Rather, we come to the Son to obtain salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we come to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>First we are forgiven, then we are accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must see this clearly.</S>
