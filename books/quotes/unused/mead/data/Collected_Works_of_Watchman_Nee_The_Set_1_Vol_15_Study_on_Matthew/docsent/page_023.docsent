   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 14: "Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The way is constricted because it is the way of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is so narrow that it takes only God's will, and it is so constricted that it takes only God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nothing of the flesh, the world, or today's glory can be brought in. "Few are those who find it." This shows that truth is usually among a small number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That the narrow gate and the constricted way need to be found shows that there are many people who do not even know that they exist.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word for way here in Matthew 7:14 is also used in Acts 9:2, "any who were of the Way," and 19:9, "speaking evil of the Way."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The same word is also found in Acts 19:23 and 24:22.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Acts we see that people were exhorted to believe in this Way and to walk on this Way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verses 15-20: What kind of people are called "false prophets"?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are those who have received a special kind of inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, those who wrote the Bible were called prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 2 Peter 1:21 we are told that a prophet is one who receives inspiration and speaks forth the words of another person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A false prophet is also inspired, but not by the Holy Spirit, and he also speaks forth the words of another person, but not the words of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Prophets are directly related to teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sheep are very timid, so the false prophets appear to be the same outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Wolves" may refer to evil spirits, because the outward sheepskins were stolen by them, and even the inward things are not their own.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The "fruits" here refer to teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fruits of the prophets are teachings, not conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether or not he is a false prophet is determined by what he teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Figs and grapes were the best fruits among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No teachings of God can be heard from the mouth of the false prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 19: "Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These surely are people who will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verses 21-23 are of one section, verses 24-27 are of another section, and verses 28-29 are of a third section.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 21: "Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here the Lord told us positively that he who says "Lord, Lord" will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but not every one who says "Lord, Lord" will enter in. "Not every one." These words are crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 10:9 says, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord...you will be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that the first condition for entering into the kingdom of the heavens is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, not every one who is saved will enter into the kingdom of the heavens; not every Christian will participate in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a second condition; that is, those who do the will of God will enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The general conditions for entering into the kingdom of the heavens are, first, being saved and, second, doing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 21 gives the general conditions for entering into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 22 illustrates a particular case of exclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 23 gives the specific consequence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 23: The Greek word for knew is the same as the word for acknowledge in Romans 7:15.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There, in Romans 7:15, I do not acknowledge means "I do not consider it right."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here, I never knew you may be translated "I never approved of you"; that is, "I never considered what you were doing as right."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those referred to in verses 21-23 are Christians, for the following reasons: 1 In their context these verses refer to Christians because the teachings on the mountain are spoken basically to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2 The teachings on the mountain, from the beginning to the end, never speak concerning the way of salvation, for they were spoken to those who were already saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>3 In this section, verses 21-23, what is dealt with is not the question of faith but the question of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We know that salvation is of faith and not of works.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, here it is not concerned with the perishing of the unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>4 Which day is "that day"?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is the day of judgment at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only the saved ones can be there for this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not the judgment at the great white throne.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>5 They are people who have confessed the Lord as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>6 In their work they are able to prophesy, to cast out demons, and to do works of power in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"That day" is a special term used in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The "man's day" mentioned in 1 Corinthians 4:3 refers to today, the present age in which man judges.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"That day" is the day of the Lord Isa 2:11-12; Zech 12:9-14; 13:2; 14:1-9; 2 Tim 1:12, 18; 4:8 , referring specifically to the day of judgment at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only the saved ones will be judged there.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Matthew 7:22, the word "many" shows that a great number of people will not be able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"Lord, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the second time of such calling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"In Your name...we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These few things are the highest gifts in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To prophesy is to be a prophet, to cast out demons is to bring in God's kingdom, and to do works of power is to exercise the powers of the age to come.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These workers mentioned especially these few things as if to show that they were quite qualified to enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to the original language, the first part of verse 23 may be rendered, "And then I will confess to them."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Matthew 10:32-33 the word "confess" definitely refers to the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A saved one who does not confess in the Lord but rather denies Him today will not get the glory in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What the Lord meant in verse 23 is that "I never confessed that I knew you."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Knew here should be more properly translated "approved of."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The reason that the Lord does not approve of them is that they are "workers of lawlessness."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Greek word for lawlessness means "overstepping."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The workers of lawlessness are those who do not abide by the rules for entering into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"Depart from Me" indicates that they have no part in the glory, which is different from the glory mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 1:9.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The general requirement for entering into the kingdom of the heavens is to be saved and do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Holy Spirit who dwells in man has a personality; He exercises control over man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, the Holy Spirit who falls upon man is without personality; He is subject to man the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets 1 Cor 14:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Holy Spirit dwells only in the saved ones, but the Holy Spirit may fall upon an unsaved one, for example, Balaam and Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In casting out demons, prophesying, and doing works of power, one may still be doing lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In these things, there is still the danger of not doing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The iniquity in Numbers 18:1 is an iniquity of violating the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need to pray that we may be delivered from this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The three things prophesying, casting out demons, and doing works of power will be restored at the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Verses 24-27: In this section the Lord used parables to confirm what has been said before.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In verse 24 the problem is not whether you have heard it, but whether you will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The words have been heard, but doing them is up to the individual.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In a broad sense, "these words" include all the teachings given on the mountain; in a narrower sense, they refer to the words in the preceding text concerning doing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The "rock" here does not refer to the Lord; it refers to the doing of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A "foolish" man is not an evil man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Even the foolish ones mentioned in Matthew 25:2 are not the unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Here, it speaks altogether concerning the matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What is beaten by the wind and the rain is the work, the conduct, of the person and not the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Thus, we can see that he is a saved one.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Here it does not say that the one who builds his house upon the rock is a good man; it says that he is a prudent man.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is similar to the case of the prudent virgins mentioned in Matthew 25:2.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>One "who hears these words of Mine and does them" is one who does according to the words of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is not that the foolish one does nothing, since he also goes to build something.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Rather, he does not do according to the word of God but according to his own idea.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>One shortcoming of today's believers is that they imitate people.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What is the difference between the prudent and the foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Both spent time and effort and both built.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, the foolish man wasted his effort by building on the sand.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The prudent man fixes his eyes on the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The rain, the river, and the wind refer to great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The rain descends from above, the wind blows from four sides, and the rivers beat upon the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>According to the Bible, "rain" signifies the work of the evil spirits, "wind" signifies teachings of heresy Eph 4:14 , and "water" signifies the power of the evil spirits.</S>
