<P>After we have read the book of Ephesians, we will see the relationship between "the first love" and "the first works": "But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love" (4:15-16). These are the "first works" that parallel the "first love." The "first works" are not what man praises or sees. They are works in secret, like the works done by the "joints." The works considered precious by the Lord are not those that are outwardly great or important, but those that actually build up the Body of Christ "in love." This is the truly effective work. Without the intention of love there is no work of love. Because there is the love of the Lord Jesus, all the works become works for the building up of the church, and there will be the fitting and the knitting in harmony, and no dissension of opinions will be brought in. Although the church has now left its first love and has not done its first works, we can still be joined to the Head and can grow into Him in all things, from whom we will receive the supply and the strength. All those who have received the power of love from the Head can do the "first works." At present, we see the desolation of the church. Both the first love and the first works are all gone. This is the time for us to bow down before God, to humble ourselves and to confess our sins. The Lord calls us to repentance. The door of grace is still wide open. We should come quickly. Thank the Lord. He has shown us that many saints are willing to leave all organizations and are willing not only to hold fast to the first love but to revive the first works. How sad a thing it is that the church, including the saints, have left the first love and must now repent! Of course, the sadder thing is that some would not even repent after their fall. How did the church fall to such an extent? Paul saw the danger among the Ephesians from the very beginning. Hence, he had the prayer in Ephesians 3:14-19. It is easy for a Christian to love the Lord in an instant. In the real church most people have the experience of the first love, but how many are there that continue daily to be burning? I am afraid that many who loved the Lord a few years ago have now gradually become cold. Why is this the case? Paul's prayer gives the reason for this fall: "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love" (v. 17). Anything that does not have a foundation will not last forever. If our love is like the tree that has roots or the house on the ground, this love will be the "first love" all the time. What is this root and ground? It is Christ making "His home in your hearts." This is the source for the love to be rooted and grounded. Our greatest danger is to have much spiritual knowledge without the experience of Christ living in our hearts. Paul prayed for the Ephesians this way because they did not have this experience. They had received God's love (1:5-8), but this love had not been rooted and grounded in their hearts. Hence, Paul prayed for them. Is Christ really making home in our hearts? We should not answer this question rashly. We must not conjecture or assume that we have it already. This question should drive us to pray in the closet. How can Christ make home in our heart? The Bible is not silent concerning this. "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith" (3:17). When we receive the Lord Jesus Christ with a definite faith and allow Him to make home in our heart, our love will be rooted and grounded, and we will "be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth" (v. 18). When the Lord of love makes home in us, we will realize the measure of love. "And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ" (v. 19). The passing of time only manifests the unchanging love of the Lord. Christ's making home in our heart is not a temporary thing. Therefore, when we have this, we will not leave the love. I believe we have tasted and touched the Lord's love, but does not our heart hope for a more stable and steady spiritual condition? Is not a life of abiding in the Lord's house a wonderful one? May Christ become our satisfaction and our protection.</P><P>Thank and praise the Lord. This kind of blessing is not only reserved for those Christians who have reached the far end or the finishing line of their journey. Rather, it was there from the beginning. This love is the "first" love. These works are the "first" works. A young believer can just as easily obtain this grace. Other than Christ making home in our hearts, there is no other thing that can satisfy our hearts. "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever" (John 4:13-14). The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of this age are all of this world. Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, but the fact that it will make man thirst again makes more drinkers come back. The world binds people with its vexations, but God is to be blessed because when we drink by faith of the water that the Lord gives, He fully satisfies us.</P><P>How good it would be if we have never left the Lord's love! If we have, we must remember where we "have fallen from and repent and do the first works." If we see that the Lord loves us deeply, we will surely humble ourselves in ashes and confess our failures. But there is something to rejoice for: He is gracious. Surely we feel remorseful when we consider our failures; our testimony for Him is weak and shaky. However, in Him we can still rejoice because in Him there is no failure. If we trust in His love, come near to Him, and confess our sins in a penitent way, He will not turn us back empty-handed but will grant us His strength and blessing. A vain reminiscence of our failure will not give us the strength to do the first works, but if we call on the Lord who delivers us, our victory will be assured. Humility is what we should have. However, it is the Lord who can revive us.</P><P>After this, there were the Lord's warnings. Because the church had left its first love and was no longer doing its first works, the Lord had to say: "But if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place." How severe this is! If the Lord's own words of encouragement and rebuke cannot cause you to repent, nothing will change your failure and degradation anymore! Other than judgment, there will not be any further way left for love.</P>
