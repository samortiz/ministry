<h1 class="title">THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH<br />
IN PHILIPPIANS AND COLOSSIANS</h1>
<p>In this chapter we shall consider the crucial points in the books of Philippians and Colossians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PHILIPPIANS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Bountiful Supply<br />
of the Spirit of Jesus Christ<br />
for Living and Magnifying Christ</h2>
<p>The first crucial point in this book is found in 1:19-21. The Spirit here is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, compounded with the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection. According to verses 20 and 21, this bountiful supply is for the believers to live Christ and to magnify Christ. The living and magnifying of Christ is our daily salvation. We need to be saved daily by experiencing Christ to live Him and to magnify Him by the all-inclusive, bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Letting the Mind of Christ Be in Us</h2>
<p>Chapter two of Philippians contains several crucial points. The first is found in verse 5 which says, &ldquo;Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This verse is similar to Colossians 3:16 which says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; Something that can dwell in you must be living. The word there is personified; it is the word as a person. We must let this Person dwell in us. For the mind which was in Christ Jesus to be in us means that this mind is something living. To translate this phrase as &ldquo;take the mind of Christ,&rdquo; or &ldquo;possess the mind of Christ&rdquo; would be to lose the proper significance of this verse. The mind of Christ actually is just Christ Himself. However, Paul did not say, &ldquo;Let Christ be in you.&rdquo; Rather, he said to let this mind, this particular mind which was in Christ Jesus, be in you.</p>
<p>We must not forget that the subject of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ. This book firstly tells us in chapter one that we need the all-inclusive bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Furthermore, this bountiful supply is for us to live Christ and to magnify Christ. The means for us to live Christ is the bountiful supply of the Spirit. Following this, chapter two gives us another point concerning our experience of Christ. The second means for us to experience Christ is to let the living mind which was in Christ Jesus be in us. There is in the universe a living Mind, a mind which Paul calls &ldquo;this mind.&rdquo; This living Mind is waiting for you to open up yourself and let Him in. It is not simply that you take Christ as a pattern to imitate Him. The point here is that the Christ whom we experience is very practical and available. His mind especially is so living and active. Just as our minds are so active, the mind of Christ is even more active.</p>
<p>In Paul&rsquo;s writings he sometimes refers to Christ&rsquo;s meekness and Christ&rsquo;s forbearance (2 Cor. 10:1). However, meekness and forbearance are not personified. But here His mind is likened to a person. You cannot say that the meekness or the forbearance of Christ dwell in you. Paul does not use this expression. Rather he says to let this mind which is in Christ Jesus be in you. This means practically speaking the Person of Christ is manifested in His mind. We must take the practical Christ. He is living, and His mind is living and waiting for us to open to Him. We must open ourselves to let such a mind be in us.</p>
<p>Once we let the living mind of Christ be in us, this mind will transform us. Ephesians 4:23 says that we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind, and Romans 12:2 says, &ldquo;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; The renewed mind, the mind with the spirit, is the mind indwelt by the mind of Christ. This mind which was in Christ is a transforming mind, a renewing mind. To have the mind of Christ in us is for our transformation. We do not merely follow Christ&rsquo;s steps outwardly, but we let Christ&rsquo;s living mind be in us inwardly to transform us. By this we will live a life that is a mingled life, a life of divinity mingled with humanity.</p>
<p>This portion of Philippians 2 shows us a mingled life. Christ is revealed here to be both God and man. The life lived by this God-man is a mingled life. It is not an exchanged life but two lives in one union. He was God yet He did not live in the form of God. Rather He took the form of a slave and was found in fashion as a man. Such a one was God living in humanity with the form of a slave in the fashion of a man. Christ did not simply spend one year in the fashion of a man. For thirty-three and a half years He was found in the fashion of a man. His living was His work. In Philippians 3:9 Paul desired to &ldquo;be found in Him.&rdquo; In chapter two Christ was found in the fashion of a man, and in chapter three Paul desired to be found in Him. This refers to his living.</p>
<p>When we have the living mind of Christ, this mind will transform us. Our transformed form will simply be His image. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed into the same image. Whatever Christ lived will be lived out by us. Christ was humble, and spontaneously we will be the same, because He will be the mind acting and living in us to transform us. Spontaneously we will live a life which is a grafted life, two lives mingled together as He had. When He was being found in the fashion of a man, He lived a life which was the divine life and the human life. The life of God and the life of man became the mingled life of the God-man. Now we repeat His history by living a mingled life of two natures, both human and divine. His life was both divine and human, and our life is human and divine. In principle, our life is the same as His.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 06: The Crucial Points of Truth in Paul's Epistles &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
