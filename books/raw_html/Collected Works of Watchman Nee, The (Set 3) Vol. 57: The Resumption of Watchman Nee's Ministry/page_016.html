<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE WAY OF THE CHURCH</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 11, 1948, Lord's Day afternoon<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">The Tabernacle and the Temple<br />Typifying Two Aspects of the Church</h2><p>Concerning the question of the desolation of the church, we must first consider the way of the church on earth. The way of the church on earth can be seen from the history of the tabernacle in the Old Testament. The tabernacle in the Old Testament was set up by God. The purpose of the tabernacle was for God to dwell with His people Israel (Exo. 25:8). There are many basic differences between the temple and the tabernacle. In the beginning God dwelt in the tabernacle. After the temple was finished, God began to dwell in the temple (1 Kings 9:3). Both the tabernacle and the temple typify God's dwelling among men. The two appear to be repetitions in type. Actually, they are not repetitions. In the past many people have written books concerning the tabernacle as a type. But few books have been written concerning the temple as a type. Actually, both are types of the church. Yet there are some basic differences between the two.</p><h2 class="head2">The Tabernacle in the Wilderness<br />Being Temporary and Movable,<br />whereas the Temple in the Holy Land<br />Being Eternal and Stable</h2><p>The tabernacle was built in the wilderness under the direction of Moses and Aaron. The temple was prepared by David and completed by Solomon in Jerusalem. The tabernacle did not have a floor. It had a cover and curtains. When a person entered the tabernacle, his feet touched the sand on the ground, reminding him that the tabernacle was something transitory and movable. This is why it was called the tabernacle, or "the tent of meeting.''</p><p>The temple had many similarities to the tabernacle. In the tabernacle, there were gold, silver, brass, and iron. In the temple there were the wood and the stones. The stones were a crucial material. In the New Testament the Lord called Peter, Cephas (John 1:42). The word Cephas means a stone. In the tabernacle there was no stone. Stones are immovable; they signify stability and solidarity. The tabernacle was designed for the wilderness; it was transitory in nature. The temple was designed for the kingdom; it was eternal in nature. David represents the Lord, and Solomon represents the Holy Spirit. The meaning of Solomon is the One who brings in peace. God sent the Holy Spirit of peace to build up the temple. David is a type of the incarnated Christ, and Solomon is a type of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Tabernacle Typifying God's Church on Earth,<br />whereas the Temple Typifying the Church<br />as Christ's Unique Body</h2><p>In the Bible there are always two aspects to God's habitation. On the one hand, it is transitory and wandering, typified by the tabernacle. The tabernacle moved as the people traveled along. Sometimes it was in Elim. At other times it was in Kadesh-barnea. Sometimes it was in the land of supply. At other times it was in the land of bitter water. However, the tabernacle itself did not change with a change of location. Wherever the Israelites pitched their tents, there was the tabernacle. Hence, the tabernacle typifies God's church on earth, or His church in the localities. In Shanghai there is the church, because in Shanghai there are God's people. Whenever God's people come together, there is the church. When they are separated, there is no church. This is the aspect of the church as typified by the tabernacle.</p><p>The temple was different from the tabernacle. The temple was established on the threshingfloor of Ornan (2 Chron. 3:1) and built with stones. It was built for the kingdom. It was the center of the life of the people of Israel. The temple was unique, eternal, and solid, and it could not be divided. Even when the nation was divided politically, the temple could not be divided. There could be only one temple.</p><p>From this we see that, on the one hand, the church appears in different localities. Yet the spiritual reality of the church is still one Body. It is unique and eternal. These are the two pictures of the church.</p>
