BY LOVING THE LORD AND<br />
KEEPING HIS COMMANDMENTS</h2>
<p>How can we have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation? The Lord says, &ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him&rdquo; (John 14:21). A person who has the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation loves the Lord and keeps His commandments. Such a person is loved by the Father and the Son. Not only so, the Son also manifests Himself to him. Whether you have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation depends on whether you love the Lord and keep His commandments. This is a practical and serious test.</p>
<p>We have received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, and the Lord is in us. We are people in the Lord. However, it may be difficult for us to take a further step and have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation. The problem is whether we love the Lord and keep His commandments. Some people are saved but do not love the Lord or keep His commandments. Others are saved and love the Lord, but they have only a partial love for the Lord. A person who has a partial love for the Lord keeps the Lord&rsquo;s commandment when it suits him. When the Lord&rsquo;s commandment is disagreeable to him, he will not keep it. At such a time, he does not let the Lord win; rather, he defeats the Lord. Any dispute between us and the Lord in which we defeat the Lord instead of letting Him defeat us, proves that we do not love Him enough. Some may ask when and in what matters they have defeated the Lord. The Lord has been defeated by us in many things. Going to the movies is an example. We may have a strong desire to go see a movie, but the Lord gives an inward command, saying, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; This is the Lord&rsquo;s speaking to us in love. Even though we know that we should obey Him, we disobey and go to the movie. This is the way that we defeat the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord speaks to us because we love Him. If we did not love Him, He would not bother to speak to us. Our love for a person is an encouragement for him to speak to us. If someone does not want a person to speak to him, he should not love him. If he ignores a person and does not bother with him, the person will not come to him, much less speak to him. Conversely, whomever he loves will come to him. This also applies to all of us. Those whom we do not love or whom we dislike will not bother to speak to us. But the more we love someone, the more he will come to be near us and speak with us.</p>
<p>Similarly, as a result of even a little love toward the Lord Jesus, He will come to bother you. He will say, &ldquo;Did you not say that you love Me? Did you not say that you would consecrate yourself to Me?&rdquo; Because you have consecrated yourself to the Lord, you love Him. Therefore, now when you want to go to a movie, the Lord will say, &ldquo;Do not go.&rdquo; This is the Lord&rsquo;s commandment. He who has the Lord&rsquo;s commandments and keeps them loves the Lord. However, after you receive the Lord&rsquo;s commandment, you may argue with Him. The Lord says, &ldquo;Do not go,&rdquo; but you say, &ldquo;I want to go.&rdquo; The Lord says, &ldquo;Do not go,&rdquo; but you say, &ldquo;I will go only this once.&rdquo; The Lord says, &ldquo;You must not go,&rdquo; but you insist, &ldquo;I will go this time but not again.&rdquo; The Lord says, &ldquo;No, not even this time.&rdquo; This is the argument that you have with the Lord. I believe that you all have had this kind of experience. It may not have been concerning movies, but we have many such arguments with the Lord, and it seems that we always defeat the Lord. We all have had the experience of defeating the Lord. The Lord Jesus is so great and we are so small, yet we often defeat Him and overthrow His throne in us. The Lord is daily being defeated by many people whom He has saved. We should consider how many times we have defeated the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Many times, when the Lord asks us to do something, we argue with Him. This argument is a battle between the Lord and us. The Lord gives us a commandment, but we receive it grudgingly, or we say that we would rather do something else. If the Lord says no, we argue with Him, and we defeat Him again. Although it seems as if we have only defeated the Lord, we actually have disobeyed His commandment. Many of us have had this experience.</p>
<p>Every time we defeat the Lord and disobey His commandment, we lose His presence within us, and we no longer have His face, because He hides Himself from us. However, there are also times when He gives a commandment, and we say, &ldquo;O Lord, because I love You, I will let myself be defeated. I will receive Your commandment, listen to Your commandment, and obey Your commandment. I will go along with what You say.&rdquo; Whenever we respond in this way, we experience sweetness, joy, and light. We sense that the Lord is with us, and we see His face, His manifestation.</p>
<p>There was a young child who was saved and properly shepherded. He often prayed, &ldquo;O Lord, I belong to You, and I am in You. I give myself to You. Lord, I love You. I am willing to live to You.&rdquo; This is a good prayer. One morning, his mother gave him ten dollars. He was very happy and said, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord. You love me so much that You have caused my mother to love me and give me ten dollars. Lord, I thank You and praise You.&rdquo; Immediately after he gave thanks, the Lord Jesus said to him, &ldquo;I want you to give the ten dollars to the child from a poor family who sat next to you in children&rsquo;s meeting.&rdquo; This made the child sad, and he could not pray anymore. The ten dollars became a problem. The Lord wanted him to give the ten dollars away, but he treasured the money and wanted to keep it. After that the child lost the Lord&rsquo;s presence. This does not mean that the Lord was not with him; it means that he could not sense the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The Lord&rsquo;s presence was hidden from him. He could not see the Lord&rsquo;s face, so he no longer had any joy.</p>
<p>When his mother noticed that something was wrong, she asked why he was unhappy. However, the child was not willing to talk about it; he said that everything was okay. It seemed as if the problem was the ten dollars, but the real problem was his love for the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord might have asked, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than the ten dollars?&rdquo; This would have bothered the child. The Lord said, &ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me...If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word&rdquo; (John 14:21, 23). Christians may appear to have no problem, but there is a problem concerning their love for the Lord. This child had a problem because he regarded the ten dollars more than the Lord&rsquo;s word, the Lord&rsquo;s commandment. It seemed as if he would rather have the ten dollars than the Lord.</p>
<p>Because the child did not want to let go of the Lord, he wished that the Lord had not given him this commandment. He hoped in his heart that the Lord would change this commandment, but the Lord insisted on his giving the ten dollars away. Therefore, the child struggled for a period of time. While he did not obey the Lord, he had no light, and he did not have the presence of the Lord. Therefore, he was unhappy. This is the story of a Christian. We have had this kind of experience often. Even a person who has followed the Lord for many years often argues with the Lord. In the midst of his argument, he often realizes that the Lord has withdrawn and is hiding His face. His argument with the Lord is the result of his partial love for the Lord. Genuine love is unconditional. If our love for the Lord is genuine, we will keep His word. Whatever He says, we will do. Whatever He wants, we will give. Whatever He requires of us, we will accept. If we genuinely love the Lord, we will keep His commandments, and we will have His manifestation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
