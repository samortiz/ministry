   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Explaining things clearly and making the assignments is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to arrange for drills and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Others should not only understand what to do, but they must also be given the opportunity to practice and make trial runs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A worker must not only be capable of working by himself but must also be able to direct others to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The work of "prayer and the ministry of the word" is not for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even Stephen had to remain a server of tables.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, every one of us has to practice doing things in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is particularly true for doing things which are difficult, unfamiliar, and new; there is the need to have practice sessions ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>DEALING WITH THOSE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>WHO HAVE COMMITTED MISTAKES</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may ask, "What should we do with those who have committed mistakes?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are two kinds of people who make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first are the lazy ones; those who are lazy often make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second are the proud ones; those who are proud also make mistakes easily.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A lazy person is uncaring and unconcerned, while a proud person thinks that he can do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who are proud should be given some form of punishment when they make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They can be told that they will no longer be assigned such a responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everyone else will have an assignment in the service; they alone will be left out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They must humble themselves before they will be given another assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a lazy person commits a mistake, he should be exhorted; he must not be allowed to give up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more he wants to give up, the more we have to force him to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to perfect him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If he makes a mistake again, we have to go to him again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to force him to take up responsibilities; he cannot remain an uncaring and irresponsible person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The prouder a person is, the less he should be assigned responsibility, but the lazier a person is, the more he should be assigned work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a sign of laziness to refuse to work by using preaching as an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>More than half of the reason for neglect among the co-workers is laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The above seven guidelines are principles of managing affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are methods of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we follow these principles and carry them out properly, we will be of great use to the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is always room for more learning in the church.</S>
