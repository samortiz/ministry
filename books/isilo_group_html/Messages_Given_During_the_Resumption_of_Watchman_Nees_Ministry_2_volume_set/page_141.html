But it is not enough simply to listen to his words. When a person opens his mouth, whether the speaking is three or five sentences, or three or five minutes, you can find out right away where this person is. If a person does not open his mouth, you will not touch his spirit. A man can say nice words, rash words, or evil words. No matter what he says, his spirit does not change. Today, no one can know another person's spirit, except through his words.</P><P>Once a person opens his mouth, he gives away his spirit. The disciples said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" Immediately the Lord said, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" (Luke 9:54-55). The minute the disciples opened their mouths, the Lord pointed out the condition of their spirit. We must never only listen to others' words. Instead, we must know others' spirit through their words. The receiving of a person for the Lord's table is not simply a matter of asking questions, but a matter of the condition of a person's spirit.</P><P>If a person requests to be received at the Lord's table, and you feel that his spirit is not right, you should deal with the matter. Whoever has such feelings has the responsibility to deal with the matter. All dealings are directed toward the persons concerned only. If a person should not be received, we only need to tell this one alone; there is no need to pass this word around to another person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY&#151;<br>THE TREASURE IN THE EARTHEN VESSEL</H2><P>Question: What is the difference between the minister in 2 Corinthians 3 and that in the other places?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: The minister mentioned in this chapter is different from the ministers we speak of in these days. The minister here is of the New Testament ministry. There is a difference between the nature of the New Testament ministry and the Old Testament ministry. The focus of the New Testament ministry is the beholding of the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face as recorded in 3:18.</P><P>Second Corinthians 4 tells us the result of having this ministry, and it goes on to tell us our relationship with the Lord. This relationship is described in 4:7, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels." This is a very crucial verse in the New Testament. The reason we have this ministry is that we have the treasure in the earthen vessel. Outwardly we may be an earthen vessel, but inwardly we have the treasure. We are not only giving the treasure to others, but we are giving the treasure that is hidden in the earthen vessels to others. The problem is that today men only want to improve their earthen vessels; they do not want to show the treasure that is hidden in the earthen vessels. Some people hold on to themselves too much. As a result, the treasure is not able to be shown forth. The principle of the spiritual life is that the treasure is hidden in the earthen vessel. It is not a mending of the earthen vessel, nor any artificial way of improving the natural man. We are not trying to cause the earthen vessel to cease to be an earthen vessel any longer. It does not mean that when a person no longer tries to say anything, hear anything, see anything, and do anything, he becomes spiritual. An earthen vessel is still an earthen vessel. The earthen vessel will never be worth much. If the Lord arranges for you to be a student, simply be a student. If the Lord arranges for you to be a housewife, simply be a housewife. To be a student or a housewife will not cover up the treasure within you. The ministry of the New Testament is a matter of how much treasure the Lord has given you. It is not a matter of how much you have washed the earthen vessel.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_140.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_142.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 141</div><br></body></html>
