	 <h2 class="head2">Small Groups Being<br />
in the Nature of Home Nurturing,<br />
Whereas Joint Meetings Being<br />
in the Nature of School Education</h2>
<p>In order for a country to be powerful and prosperous, the most essential component is the need for strong family units. A family unit will produce and nurture strong, healthy descendants who will be strong citizens of a country. Without sufficiently strong families, there will be weak citizens of a weak country. This principle is the same for the church; if a family is not strong, it will be difficult for the saints to be strong.</p>
<p>In order for a country to be powerful and prosperous, another essential component is the need for a matching system of education. Homes are for nurturing, and schools are for educating. Both of these components are necessary. Therefore, after studying our situation, we realize that there is still a need for joint meetings in the church life, which are in the nature of school education, and for small group meetings, which are in the nature of home nurturing. When the citizens of a nation have proper nurturing in the homes plus a good education at school, its young people will grow spontaneously to become strong citizens who will make the nation powerful and prosperous. The church also has a need for proper nurturing in the &ldquo;family&rdquo; units of the small groups and, at the same time, for gathering together in joint meetings from once a week to at least once a month. During these times, there should be some education in the truth, which is in the nature of a school.</p>
<p>From now on we should stress both sides because everything needs two sides in order to go forward with balance. For example, a person with only one leg has difficulty walking, and a person with one eye has difficulty seeing. In order for a church to go on in a good way, there must be home nurturing and school education. In other words, we must have small group meetings for home nurturing, and we must also have joint meetings to educate in the truth. In the past we relied only on joint meetings and neglected the nurturing in the homes; consequently, many people did not remain. In other words, without the &ldquo;family&rdquo; units in the homes, our newborn children were not nurtured and could not grow. We must recover the small groups and build them up as the base of our increase and spread.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Small Groups Being the Genuine Base<br />
for the Church&rsquo;s Increase and Spread</h2>
<p>Forming small groups has another advantage of not needing additional large facilities. If the Lord blesses us in our pursuit of our vow to bring one person to the Lord in the coming year, we will double in number. Furthermore, if we continue to recover the saints who have not been meeting for some time, the number in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting in the church in Taipei will surpass ten thousand. If we are dependent upon big meetings, where could these people meet? We would not be able to keep up with the need even if we immediately began to build new meeting halls. However, if our homes are the base, whether or not we have a meeting hall will not be a problem. Even without a meeting hall, people can meet in homes and receive care. But if there are no homes, many people will have no place to go.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot rely solely on the big meetings; instead, we must rely on the small groups. If there are five thousand saints meeting in the church in Taipei, there needs to be at least five hundred small groups; if the number of people meeting increases to ten thousand, then we need to form one thousand small groups. In principle, the number of homes and the formation of small groups should increase proportionately to the increase in the number of people. In this way, with or without meeting halls, we can still have the church life and take care of people. As long as we have homes as our base and set them up well, all our basic problems can be addressed. Even if we have no &ldquo;schools&rdquo; for higher education, we can provide a general education, even if it is at a high school level. Therefore, our first responsibility is to recover the small groups and to make them more effective than before.</p>
<p>I hope that all of us would be impressed deeply and receive this fellowship. This is not for others but for us so that all our homes can be opened &ldquo;from house to house.&rdquo; This is the means and the base for the increase and spread of the church. Once this way is established, even denominational groups in Christianity will adopt this way. Today Christianity is not flourishing because they rely on big meetings and on one preacher or pastor. Although this is better than nothing, it is not the proper way. The proper way involves small groups. Once small groups are established, there will be the increase.</p>
