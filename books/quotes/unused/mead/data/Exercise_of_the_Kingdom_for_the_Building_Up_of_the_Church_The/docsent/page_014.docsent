   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH OUR TASTE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some saints in the Lord s recovery, however, have tried to have their choice regarding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After staying in a certain place for a period of time, they became unhappy with the church there, especially with the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, they moved to another locality and stayed there for another period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Being unhappy there, they moved to still another place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In each locality the situation was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This illustrates the fact that no church can satisfy you according to your taste.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, what you need to do is to willingly bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not make any selection, for all the churches are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you cannot be happy in one place, you will not be happy in any other place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not try to deal with the church, but deal with your taste.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>NO PREFERENCES</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many are able to get along with the church, but not with some of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If this is your situation, you are finished with the building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you make a selection among the churches, you are a wide open gate for Satan to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, you must use the second key the taking up of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to say, Lord, Your will is that there be one church in the universe and one church in every city.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Lord, Your will is also that I be one with all my brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As long as anyone is a believer, I must accept him without choice or preference.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>My likes or dislikes do not mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the unique way for us to be built together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, our preferences and tastes will constantly fluctuate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today I may feel positively toward you, but tomorrow I may feel negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both in the church life and in married life there should be no fluctuation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What can keep us stable and steadfast is the bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the second practical key for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the previous message we saw that the first key is denying the self.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now we see that the second key is taking up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Denying the self is negative, whereas taking up the cross is positive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The only way to fulfill God s will is to take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not blame the brothers and sisters, and do not even blame yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, simply take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not give any ground to your choice or preference.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Your destiny is God s will, God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to take the one church and all the brothers and sisters as God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, deep within us we may have certain preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may like some and dislike others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because we are natural and human, we all have our preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if we exercise our preference, there will not be any building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A TESTIMONY OF THE GENUINE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the demons and evil angels are observing us and examining our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, our testimony is not merely before men, but before the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What a shame it is if we talk about the building, but do not actually have the building because of our natural preferences!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to pray, Lord, help us and grant us the sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We want to bear the cross so that no evil angel may be able to say a negative word about our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are here as the testimony of the building, and we want there to be no ground for the demons and evil angels to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man may not know what is taking place, but all the demons and evil angels understand what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They know what is in our heart and whether or not we are willing to take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are willing to bear the cross, then we are a real testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A battle is raging today not simply before men, but before all the evil powers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, we must have no preferences, no choices except the will of God; and we must take up the cross, that is, take up the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we have seen the vision of the one church and of all the saints as the members of the one Body, then we shall have no choice and no personal taste.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not care for our taste, feeling, or consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Rather, we should care only for God s will that we would have the genuine oneness, the oneness that can stand the investigation of all the demons and the principalities and powers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We want to have the testimony before the evil powers that we are a people with the genuine oneness because we are all willing to take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are not suffering like criminals, but we are happy cross-bearers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I believe that at this end time throughout the entire earth there will be a people bearing such a testimony.</S>
