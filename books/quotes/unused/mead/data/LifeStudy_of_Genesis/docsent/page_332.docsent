   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Drifted into the Wicked City</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Lot's group had left God's witness and testimony, they drifted into the wicked city of Sodom 13:12-13; 19:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you leave the church life, you will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Like a piece of driftwood that cannot control its direction but is carried along by the current, you will drift with the tide of this age and float downward until you find yourself in a wicked city.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 Rescued Yet Still Having Self-preference</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After Lot was rescued from the destruction of Sodom, he still had his self-preference 19:20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He begged the rescuing angels to allow him to go to a little city named Zoar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God was merciful, and the angels granted Lot his request.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you trace the history of many dissenting groups, you will see that it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At first, they were in a big city, and God gave them no blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then, after God intervened, they moved to a Zoar, a little city far away from God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They firstly left God's testimony and drifted into a God-condemned situation, and then, still having their own choice, went to a little place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>4 Isolated Farther Off from God's Witness and Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually Lot went to dwell in a cave 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Like Lot, some free groups, after leaving a large city and going to a small one, have gone to live in a cave.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have isolated themselves from the rest of God's people, refusing to have fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They may say, "Why do you say that you are the church and that we are not?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If they are the church, they should not dwell in a cave but come out to fellowship with God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But they only care for their little group in that cave.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What they have is the cave life, not the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>b The Father the Leader 1 Being Drunk with Worldly Wine</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>by the Desire of Securing Seed</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we come to the father, the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the cave, Lot became drunk with wine 19:32-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As I have pointed out previously, it was very strange that these escapees had wine with them in the cave.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They were so addicted to wine that they must have brought it with them when they fled Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wine was the drug that befuddled them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they were in the cave, Lot's daughters did not have proper fellowship with him, saying, "Father, our mother has become a pillar of salt, and we don't have husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How can we have seed?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must do something about it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May we all pray together?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If they had done this, there would have been no incest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But they did not fellowship in the spirit, nor pray to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The older daughter, the one who was more experienced with the drugs of Sodom and who had been more befuddled by them, proposed to the other that they make their father drunk with wine and lie with him that they might have seed by him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you examine today's situation, you will find that the leader of nearly every free group has been drugged and befuddled with some wine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A proper leader must be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lot should have said to the daughter who came to him with wine, "What are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Throw that away."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But Lot was not a sober person; he drank, and he even drank without self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He became drunk to such an extent that his daughters laid with him and he had no awareness of it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Most of the leaders of the free groups, being drunk with some wine, say, do, and decide things in a befuddled way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because of the befuddled condition of so many leaders, most of the members of their groups have been drugged.</S>
