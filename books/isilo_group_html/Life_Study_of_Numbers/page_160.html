A Woman Vowing a Vow<br>to Jehovah and Binding Herself by a Pledge<br>While in Her Youth within Her Father's House</H2><P>Numbers 30:3-5 speaks of a woman vowing a vow to Jehovah and binding herself by a pledge while in her youth within her father's house. In such a case, the final decision was to be made by her father. Here the woman signifies a believer, and the father signifies God the Father. In the sight of God, all believers are females. The final decision concerning any vow we make to God will be decided by the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Vow of a Married Woman<br>Being Decided by Her Husband</H2><P>In verses 6 through 8 we see that the vow of a married woman was to be decided by her husband. The husband here signifies Christ the Lord. As believers, we all have God as our Father and Christ as our Lord. As females who are in the house of our Father and who have Christ as our Husband, we do not have the right to make the final decision concerning our vows. The final decision should be made either by God the Father or by Christ the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Vow of a Widow or of a Divorced Woman</H2><P>The vow of a widow or of a divorced woman was to stand against her, and she was required to fulfill it (v. 9). But if her vow or oath was made in her husband's house, her husband was to be the deciding one (vv. 10-15). This indicates that in relation to God the Father and Christ the Lord, the believers have lost their human rights. Neither before God the Father nor before Christ the Lord do we have any rights.</P><P>Numbers 30:3-15 reveals how strict God is in the matter of authority. A young woman living in her father's house had to submit to her father. A married woman had to submit to her husband. However, a widow or a divorced woman was on her own. I do not want to be like a widow or a divorced woman. I prefer to have a father&#151;God the Father&#151;and a husband&#151;Christ the Lord. How good it is to have God as our Father and Christ as our Husband! Because I have God as my Father and Christ as my Husband, I can be at peace. The worldly people, on the contrary, behave like widows and divorced women. Instead of having God as their Father and Christ as their Lord, they stand by themselves, bearing their responsibility. We are different from the worldly people. We are females with the Father and the Lord. We should bring everything to and let the final decisions be made by our Father and our Husband.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_159.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_161.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Numbers &nbsp; pg 160</div><br></body></html>
