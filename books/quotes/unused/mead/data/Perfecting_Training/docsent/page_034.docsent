   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FLEXIBLE TO LIVE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s purpose is to have man live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s redemption and transformation have this same goal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since 1963 I have given many messages on transformation, but I did not point out strongly that transformation is just to make us flexible to live God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Transformation is not just to change us, but to make us flexible to live God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, we may get a lot of transformation, yet we still may not like to live God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What then is our peculiarity?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is just to live ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to our dictionary, peculiarity may imply some strange trait.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That is the human interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From the spiritual point of view you may be a very common and very general person with nothing particular and nothing strange, yet you are a strong person to live yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You just like to live yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You have to realize that the most common person, the most general person, lives himself the most.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some peculiar person may not live himself that much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some who are very peculiar are also very flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But some who are very general and very common are altogether definite with no flexibility.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many peculiar people are very flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet some very common and very general people are not flexible because they like to keep their way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So the human way to define peculiarity is different from the spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The spiritual way to define peculiarity is just to live yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The common ones from the spiritual point of view are the most peculiar because they don t live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They only live themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It doesn t mean that they are selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, they condemn their selfishness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But probably they have never condemned themselves for living themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may have condemned yourself that you didn t live Christ, but probably you have never condemned yourself that you live yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We don t live Christ because we live ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unconsciously, subconsciously, unintentionally, even habitually we live ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You don t need to intend to live yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To live yourself is a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as you have life, you live yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to see a vision that regardless of what kind of good Christian you may be, you don t live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all must believe that we don t live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although I have tried and tried, still I don t live Christ that much.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you would receive such a vision that you don t live Christ that much, you would condemn yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, you need to hear an even sharper word, that is, you live yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Your peculiarity is not a peculiar trait; it is just to live yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In a sense I don t need to ask you to condemn your living of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as you know that to live yourself is your peculiarity, it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then you have to practice all the day to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>PRACTICING TO LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we need to consider a few doctrinal points: who is Christ? and what is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Doctrinally we know that He is the life-giving Spirit and that He is now in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You are clear that your peculiarity is just to live yourself, so you would reject this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You would practice to live Christ realizing that He is the life-giving Spirit right now in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But, what shall you do practically?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once again I tell you that you have to pray all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By prayer I don t mean prayer in your regular way; I mean prayer in your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At anytime and anywhere you must always pray from your spirit saying, Lord, live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Lord, live out of me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This brings us to the very crucial point you must practice to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not a doctrinal matter; this must be a daily, hourly, moment-by-moment practice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Don t say something without praying, Lord, You say it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I m going to say something to this man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Lord, You say it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You be my life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Pray every moment in anything, in everything, and everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Again and again I have confessed that I didn t live the Lord so much because this practice has not been fully and absolutely built up in my life as a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But you must believe that some day this will be built up in you as a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then you will live Christ habitually.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This needs some practice.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If I were to play the piano I would use my fingers in a wild way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To learn to play the piano is to practice using the fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is to touch every key, not in a wild way, but in a trained way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We live ourselves in a wild way, but now we must have a change of habit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Instead of living ourselves, we must practice living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Don t say anything before praying; don t go any place before praying.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now you understand why Paul told us to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>And now you also understand how we could pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you simply pray according to the way you have all these years, it would be hard to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You cannot kneel or stand there unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Nor can you concentrate yourselves to pray all the day.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But you can pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Before doing anything you can pray, Lord, You live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Pray in this way all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then you will build up a habit always not to live yourself but to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Because we were fallen, we were trained according to some ethical points and also by some religious teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After we were saved, we desired to be sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We desired to be overcoming and victorious over sin.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Although these matters are apparently in the Bible, actually the Bible doesn t want us to live a sinless life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Bible wants us to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When you really live Christ, you are away from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you are really living Christ, there is no need for someone to tell you not to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When you live Christ, you are away from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If you don t live Christ, although you might overcome the world, you are still in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>No one can be separated from the world if he doesn t live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Lord wants us to live Him all the day long in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Even when you are going to rebuke or discipline your children, you have to do it by living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Before you discipline you have to pray, Lord, live Yourself through me.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you would take this word and put it into your daily practice, I believe we could stop the Perfecting Training.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>You must realize you have to pray unceasingly.</S>
