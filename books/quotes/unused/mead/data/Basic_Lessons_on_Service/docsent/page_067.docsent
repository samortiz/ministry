   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>My point in sharing this is that the hall in Chefoo was greatly used and blessed by the Lord because of the practical service poured out by so many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every bit of that meeting hall was cleaned and prepared with much love and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While the saints in Chefoo were cleaning the hall, they were praying.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As someone cleaned a chair, he would pray, "Lord, I pray that whoever sits on this chair will be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They prayed definitely in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In my whole life, I never saw a church life like the one in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There were no great giants among us, but there was the service and functioning of all the small members.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even our children were looking for opportunities to serve the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While the gospel meetings were going on, some small rooms in the meeting hall were full of saints who were praying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They prayed until the meeting was over.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was a church fully in service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was brought up and built up by every member functioning spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to let the saints know that the service of the church is the function of all the members with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This grace will reach people, nourish people, and even save people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>V. GRACE BEING GOD EMBODIED</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>IN CHRIST AS OUR ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Grace is God embodied in Christ as our enjoyment John 1:17b; 1 Cor 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every member has to experience Christ as this grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In whatever we do to serve in a practical way, grace is with us, and this grace will go out to reach others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means we minister grace to others in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>TO SERVE IN THE CHURCH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>TO MINISTER CHRIST AS GRACE TO OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regardless of what we do to serve practically, if we really do it in spirit, surely grace is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then by our doing we will minister Christ as grace to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, we need to experience the grace of Christ in our own circumstances 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we minister grace to others through our service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here we should stress that in order for us to experience Christ as grace, God always gives us certain kinds of circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sufferings and trials are often ordained by the Lord for us that we may experience Christ as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So when Paul asked the Lord three times to remove his thorn in the flesh, the Lord would not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said that His grace was sufficient for Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Under certain God-ordained circumstances, we experience grace and accumulate grace to have a storage of grace in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then when we serve, we have something as grace to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE GOAL OF OUR SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The goal of our service is not to accomplish things, even with something such as vacuuming the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our goal is to infuse others with Christ as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can infuse one another with grace while we are serving together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There should be no gossip, murmuring, criticism, or vain talk.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our talk should be our fellowship with grace to infuse one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to have grace to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, our goal is not to keep a clean hall, but to minister Christ as grace to others.</S>
