	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">JOINTS, SINEWS, AND<br />
THE OPERATION OF EACH ONE PART</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:16; Col. 2:19</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE JOINTS AND SINEWS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:16 says, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; The words <em>out from whom</em> mean out from Christ the Head. <em>Through every joint of the rich supply</em> indicates that the joints are a means of supply; <em>being joined together and being knit together</em> refers to the function of the sinews. Although this verse does not mention sinews, Colossians 2:19 uses the word <em>sinews</em>. Ephesians 4 shows that the function of the sinews is to join and knit the Body together. The joints are for supplying, and the sinews are for joining and knitting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EACH ONE PART</h2>
<p>In addition to the joints and sinews, the Body also has many parts. <em>Each one part</em> refers to the members of the Body. Every part has its own function and its own measure. The measure of a shoulder is large, and the measure of a little finger is small. Nevertheless, despite the difference in measure, each part has a function. The function of a part depends on the measure of that part.</p>
<p>Every believer is a member of the Body of Christ. Some believers are joints, and their life and work are for supplying. Other believers are sinews, and they cause all the members to be connected together through joining and knitting. Hence, in the Body of Christ there are joints for supplying, and there are sinews for joining and knitting. Furthermore, there are also many parts, and each of these parts should exercise their function. If any one part does not exercise its function, there will be a problem with that part, and this will cause the entire Body to suffer loss.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENTIRE BODY FUNCTIONING<br />
BEING THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>The Bible says that the church is the Body of Christ. Everyone who believes in Christ is a member of the Body. Even though the members differ in measure and function, they must operate in the Body. When we speak, our entire body coordinates, even though our mouth is the part that everyone sees moving. When we make a certain facial expression, many parts of our body, including our ears, our nose, and even our hands, need to act in coordination. If our hands are bound, the tone of our voice will be different, and our facial expression will not be natural. Our entire being will be bound. Hence, we should not think that our hands are unrelated to our speaking or that our eyes and nose are unrelated to our speaking. Whenever we speak, all the members of our body are in coordination and are related to one another. In the same way, the moving and functioning of the entire Body is the new way.</p>
<p>We changed the system because in the old way the hands and feet of the Body were bound. Even the shoulders were bound. Some saints may say that we were not bound, but rather that we were very free in the church life. However, even if we were in the church life for more than ten years, we did not lead anyone to salvation, nor did we take care of anyone. This shows that we were bound. Some saints led people to salvation, because of the old way the new ones did not receive proper care and &ldquo;died prematurely.&rdquo; The most we were able to do was to maintain a meeting life. In the meetings we listened to messages. Even though we murmured that one brother&rsquo;s messages were eloquent and another brother&rsquo;s messages were not, we were unable to speak the truth. This is our true situation.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters can pray with their companions, but they stop praying when another person joins them. Even though they enjoy praying together, they are quiet when they are in the meetings of the church. Many new believers are also like this. They pray in their home meetings, but they are unable to pray in the big meetings. They fear the large meetings; hence, they do not pray. This shows that in the old way of meeting, people were bound. Even the young brothers and sisters, who are lively and full of vitality when they meet together, do not know how to function when they are in a big meeting.</p>
<p>This fellowship is not to point out our shortcomings; rather, we are examining our true condition. When we stand before the Lord, we want to receive a reward, not suffer punishment.</p>
<p>We have been meeting in Taipei for more than thirty years, but our numbers have gradually decreased. If the system is not completely changed over in the next two or three years, and if our numbers continue to decrease, then in another ten years we will be finished. Hence, we must wake up. If we do not love the Lord, we should give ourselves to love the world, but if we love the Lord, we must give ourselves for this.</p>
