   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>M. SINCERITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Corinthians 1:12 Paul speaks not only of the simplicity of God but also of the sincerity of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sincerity follows simplicity and comes out of simplicity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A sincere person is always simple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do not trust those who are complicated, because they are too clever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, I can trust those who are simple, for I know that, being simple, they are sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we have simplicity, singleness, we shall also have sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because Paul conducted himself in the simplicity of God, he was truly sincere, living in the divine attribute of sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>N. GOODNESS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Luke 18:18 a "certain ruler" questioned the Lord Jesus, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one is good except One God" v. 19 . This verse reveals that God, and only God, is good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Goodness is another attribute of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What does the word "good" mean in regard to God?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Greek it is agathos, describing "that which, being good in its character or constitution, is beneficial in its effect" Vine .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus it denotes something being essentially, absolutely, and consummately beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God, being good, is essentially, absolutely, and consummately beneficial to man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His goodness, in this sense, is a beautiful item of His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>O. MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 9:16 says, "So then, it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Mercy is the most far reaching of God's attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mercy goes further than grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's love does not reach as far as His grace, and His grace does not reach as far as His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If I am in a good condition and my standing matches yours, and you give me a gift, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if I am in a pitiful condition and my standing is far removed from yours, and you give me something, that is mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I come to you as your dear friend, and you give me a gift, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if I am a poor, unclean beggar, unable to do anything for myself, and you give me a gift, that is mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This illustrates the fact that God's mercy is more far reaching than His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Grace extends only to a situation that corresponds to it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But mercy goes much further, reaching into a situation that is poor and unworthy of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to our natural condition, we were far removed from God, totally unworthy of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We were eligible only to receive His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's mercy does not depend on man's good condition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, God's mercy is shown in man's pitiful condition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It reaches beyond His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is God's mercy that has reached us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>None of us was in a condition that corresponded to His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We were so poor and pitiful that there was the need for God's mercy to extend to our fallen condition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's mercy has brought us into His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How we need to realize this and worship God for His mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even now, after being saved and having shared in the riches of God's life, we still, in some ways, are in a condition that needs God's mercy to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the reason Hebrews 4:16 says that first we need to obtain mercy, and then we can find grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Oh, how much we need God's mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should treasure His mercy as much as we appreciate His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is always God's mercy that qualifies us to participate in His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Romans 9:16 Paul says that "it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our concept is that the one who wills will gain what he wills to obtain and that the one who runs will gain what he runs after.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If this were the case, then God's selection would be according to our effort and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But it is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the contrary, God's selection is of God who shows mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not need to will or to run, for God has mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we know God's mercy, we shall not put our trust in our effort.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Neither shall we be disappointed by our failures.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The hope for our wretched condition is in God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Romans 11:32 says, "For God has shut up all in disobedience that He might show mercy to all."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Man's disobedience affords God's mercy an opportunity, and God's mercy brings man salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How marvelous is God's mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's mercy and His grace are both the expression of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we are in a pitiful condition, His mercy reaches us and brings us into a state where He is able to favor us with His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Luke 15:20-24 says that when the father saw the prodigal son returning, he had compassion on him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the deeper mercy, an expression of the father's affectionate love.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then the father clothed his son with the best robe and fed him with the fatted calf.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is grace, which also manifests the father's love.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God's mercy reaches further than His grace, bridging the gap between us and God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Often, because of our pitiful condition, we need to receive mercy before we can find grace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We come to the throne of grace Heb 4:16 like beggars, in somewhat the same condition as was the prodigal son when he came to his father.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A beggar, like the prodigal, needs mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we come to the throne of grace, we may have the sense that we are pitiful and say, "Father, I am not worthy of anything."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But the Father may say, "You are unworthy, but I am merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>My mercy reaches you and qualifies you to receive my favor.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>My mercy brings Me to you that I may clothe you with the best robe."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God's mercy is always available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we would serve God in His New Testament economy, we need to know that it is wholly a matter of God's sovereign mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Through many years of experience I have become strongly and deeply convinced that everything that happens to us is of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All is a matter of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The more we see this, the more we shall spontaneously bear our responsibility before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, even the bearing of responsibility is of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Why is it that some believers are willing to bear their responsibility and that others are not?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The answer lies in God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In Romans 9:15 Paul quotes the Lord's words, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Because of God's mercy we responded to the gospel when others did not respond, we received a word about Christ as life when others refused to receive it, and we took the way of the Lord's recovery when others drew back from taking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Regarding His recovery, God has mercy on whom He will have mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We are not in the Lord's recovery because we are more intelligent than others or because we seek the Lord more than others do.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our being here is altogether due to the mercy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you consider how the Lord brought you into the church life in the Lord's recovery, you will worship Him for His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Concerning the gospel, the ministry of life, and the church life, God has had mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>How we must praise Him for His sovereign mercy, and worship Him for His mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Ephesians 2:4 says, "God, being rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Here we see that God is rich in mercy because of His great love toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The object of love should be in a lovable condition, but the object of mercy is always in a pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God's mercy reaches us for His love.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God loves us because we are the object of His selection.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But we became pitiful by our fall, even dead in our offenses and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Therefore, we need God's mercy to reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Because of His great love, God is rich in mercy to save us from our wretched position to a condition that is suitable for His love.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This most far-reaching attribute of God should cause our heart to react to His love.</S>
