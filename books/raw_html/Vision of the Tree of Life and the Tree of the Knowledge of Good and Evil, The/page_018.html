        <h2 class="head1">THE GOD WHOM CHRISTIANS WORSHIP<br />
DIFFERING FROM THE GOD IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The God whom Christians worship is different not only from the objects worshipped in Gentile religions but also from the God who was worshipped in the Old Testament. People in the Old Testament worshipped the true and living God, but in the New Testament we worship the God of resurrection. The main difference between the living God and the God of resurrection is that the living God is outside of man, whereas the God of resurrection is within man and is mingled with man. When the Israelites were in the wilderness, they followed God, who did things for them outwardly. He was the living God. The New Testament, however, presents not merely the living God but the God of resurrection, because in the New Testament God dwells in man and is mingled with man. The New Testament does not present a God who is outside of man or who merely accomplishes miracles by His great power to manifest Himself as the true and living God. Rather, in the New Testament we see the God who is joined and mingled with man as one and who manifests Himself as the God of resurrection. He is God, yet He is a man. This is the God of resurrection. The living God does not have the human element, but the God of resurrection has the human element. We worship the God of resurrection, and God wants us to bear the testimony of the God of resurrection.</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves whether our worship of God is an outward matter or an inward matter. In order for our worship to be an inward matter, we need the Lord to change our concept. Our spiritual pursuit, prayer, and enjoyment of God do not depend on how much time we set aside nor on our learning to be quiet before God. We need a change in concept. We do not worship a God who is outside of us, nor do we pray in order to ask Him to do many things for us. We need to break out of such concepts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER BEING TO ENJOY GOD,<br />
NOT TO ASK FOR THINGS</h2>
<p>After I received mercy from the Lord, I would sometimes linger before the Lord for a considerable length of time without praying for things. If you were to ask me what I would do during such a long period of time or how I would pray, I can testify that my prayers did not have a subject. I did not take the work as my subject; instead, God was my subject. I would take Him as the focus and subject of my prayers. I would behold Him, praise Him, absorb Him, and enjoy Him and thus take Him as my subject.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find an example of the Old Testament saints or of the Lord Jesus and the disciples in the New Testament praying to ask God for so many things, as God&rsquo;s children do today. The Bible reveals that the people who knew God rarely petitioned for things. Rather, they drew near to God, contacted God, and enjoyed God.</p>
<p>If we would read the book of Acts carefully, we will realize that even when the disciples were seeking God&rsquo;s leading, their prayers were not like the prayers of Christians today. There is no record of Philip praying, &ldquo;Lord, how shall I preach the gospel? Do You want me to go to the desert or remain in the city?&rdquo; However, we must believe that Philip was a man of prayer. The subject of Philip&rsquo;s prayer was not the Lord&rsquo;s leading; his prayer was his enjoyment of God. Philip was a person who touched God and lived in God. Hence, when it was necessary, God could lead him to the desert (8:26) or take him away (v. 39). These matters were God&rsquo;s concern, not Philip&rsquo;s. Therefore, prayer is not a matter of persons who are outside of God seeking the leading of a God who is outside of them so that they may know what to do. Rather, prayer is a matter of enjoying the God who indwells us and of being mingled more with Him. A person of prayer is disarmed before God; he follows God according to His leading. Hence, Philip would not have sought God&rsquo;s leading about a particular matter; he would have received God&rsquo;s leading because he enjoyed God.</p>
<p>We must have a change of concept and learn this lesson. We are not dealing with a God who is outside of us, nor should we petition Him for many things. We do not need to tell Him when we are sick or when we have a need, because whether or not we tell Him, He already knows. Rather, we must learn to contact Him, absorb Him, enjoy Him, and linger in His presence. When God comes, the supply for our lack comes, the healing for our sickness comes, and the solution to our problem comes. When God comes, everything we need comes.</p>
<p>Prayer is not focused on things; prayer is for breathing God. Hence, we should forget other things when we go to the Lord. There is no need to pray for many things. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed? For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you&rdquo; (Matt. 6:31-33). Hence, when we go to the Lord, we should do our best to put other matters behind us and forget them, and we should learn only one thing: to absorb God, breathe God, and enjoy God.</p>
<p>Seeking and zealous Christians worship God, serve God, and pray to God. They are much better than Christians who are not seeking, who are cold, and who do not worship God, serve God, or pray to God. When zealous Christians enter into the Lord&rsquo;s presence, they often pray concerning the church, the work, their family, and their career. However, even though they might pray for half an hour, they may not have spent one minute to absorb God. This is our condition; this kind of worship is according to the human concept. If we have a vision, we will realize that this is not the way to worship God. The proper way to worship God is to be in God and to absorb and enjoy Him.</p>

	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
