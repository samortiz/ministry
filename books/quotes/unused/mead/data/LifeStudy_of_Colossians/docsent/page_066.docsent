   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE ECONOMY OF GOD S SALVATION Scripture Reading: Col 2:13-15, 18, 20-22; Eph 2:5, 15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the economy of God s salvation as it is revealed in 2:13-15.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we shall see, this economy involves three things: making us alive with Christ, abolishing the ritual law, and stripping off the evil angelic powers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE THREE ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Colossians 2:13 says, And you, being dead in the offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word dead here refers to the deadness in spirit because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We who once were dead in offenses and in the uncircumcision of the flesh have been made alive together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that God has enlivened us in Christ s resurrection with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What was accomplished in Christ s resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 is experienced through our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first aspect in the economy of God s salvation is that He has made us alive together with the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 14 Paul goes on to say, Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Greek word rendered wiping out can also be translated blotting out, obliterating, erasing, or annulling a decree of law .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Greek word rendered handwriting denotes a legal document, a bond.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here it refers to the written law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The ordinances, or decrees, refer to the ceremonial law with its rituals, the forms or ways of living and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These ordinances God has taken out of the way by nailing them to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is to abolish the law of the commandments in ordinances Eph 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This kills the heresy of keeping the Judaistic rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 15 Paul continues, Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Greek for stripping off can also be rendered putting off, as in 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The rulers and authorities spoken of in this verse are the angelic rulers and authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of the heretical teaching of angel-worship at Colosse, the passage here refers to the evil angels.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The law was given through angels Acts 7:53; Gal 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Based upon this, the heretical teachers at Colosse advocated the worship of angels Col 2:18 as mediators between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, the apostle dealt with this heresy by unveiling the fact that the law, consisting of ordinances, was nailed to the cross v. 14 , and the leading evil angels were stripped off from God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This left Christ as the sole Mediator, who is the Head of all rule and authority v. 10 . This kills the heresy of angel worship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verses 13, 14, and 15 the pronoun He refers to God in verse 12.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Greek word for make a display means show or exhibit in the sense of putting to an open shame.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God openly shamed the evil angelic rulers and authorities on the cross and triumphed over them in it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Greek words translated in it refer to the cross, but they can also be rendered in Him, referring to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not God s intention that we keep the law, and He certainly does not want us to worship angels.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s desire is to enliven human beings who are dead in offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to enliven us, He must put His very life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When His life comes into us, we are enlivened, made alive.</S>
