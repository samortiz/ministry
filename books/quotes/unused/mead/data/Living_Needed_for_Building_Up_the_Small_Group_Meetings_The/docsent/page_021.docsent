   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD DESIRING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT ALL HIS PEOPLE WOULD PROPHESY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Old Testament Moses led about two million Israelites out of Egypt into the wilderness Exo 12:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Due to the heavy burden of daily affairs, Moses began to complain a little Num 11:10-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God then charged Moses to gather together seventy elders to the Tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the elders were gathered together, the Spirit of Jehovah descended upon them, and they all prophesied vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>16-17, 24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, two of the seventy elders remained in the camp; they did not go to the Tabernacle of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, the Spirit of Jehovah also rested upon them, and they also prophesied in the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a young man saw this, he came and told Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After Joshua, the helper of Moses, heard this, he said, My lord Moses, forbid them v. 28 . But Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake? Would God that all the Lord s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them v. 29 . Moses seemed to say, Even you, Joshua, should prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Would God that every one of God s people would prophesy in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The words of Moses reveal the desire of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God desires that every one of His people would prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is similar to what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 14:31, For you can all prophesy one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Again, in 1 Corinthians 14:1 he said, Desire earnestly...that you may prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These words of Moses and Paul reveal to us the mind of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God desires that all of us who believe in Him would prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>KNOWING THE TRUTH TO PROPHESY</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we prophesy, we do not speak ordinary words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, we speak for and speak forth the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No one can understand Him, and no one has ever seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if you have experienced Christ, He will become a fact and a reality in you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way you can speak Him forth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Timothy 2:4 says that God desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s intention is not only that all men be saved, but that they would all come to a full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Christians have a wrong concept in that they think that only the preachers need to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to their concept, ordinary people who are not pastors do not need to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But God s desire is not only that all men be saved, but that they would come to a full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His desire is that all men would not merely know the truth, but come to a full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every regenerated believer has a desire to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But we cannot please Him merely by being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must strive to go on to have a full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only then will God s desire be met.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, if we do not know the truth, we have nothing to prophesy for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Recently I have heard the same words from two or three different sources.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I was told, Brother Lee, for all these years we have been listening to your ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every year we attend two big trainings for ten days, each covering thirty messages.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have been doing this for over ten years, but we still do not feel that we know very much of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, one day when we were put in a situation that required us to open our mouth, we realized that the more we spoke, the more there was in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only then did we realize that over the past ten years so many truths have been deposited into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you do not open your mouth, you do not know how much deposit there is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if you do have some deposit, then once you open your mouth, you will not be able to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The sad thing is that many of our brothers and sisters, especially the Chinese among us, would never open their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Chinese are naturally conservative; they do not like to make a show of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From our youth we were taught by the older generation not to open our mouth lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We were told that all troubles come out from the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We were taught, More speaking, more mistakes; less speaking, less mistakes; no speaking, no mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This has become our social norm and habit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may have a lot to say in private, but when we come to the meetings, we become completely silent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We were influenced from our youth by this kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because of this, it is very difficult for us to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, do not think that this is your quietness, politeness, or decency.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the subtlety of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is using these things to shut your mouth, so that you will not speak forth for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the Old Testament the Spirit of Jehovah had to fall upon men before they could prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But in the New Testament, we do not need to wait for the Spirit of God to come down upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is because on the day of Pentecost, and later in the house of Cornelius, the Lord once for all poured out Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit upon His Body, which includes all those who believe in Him throughout the ages Acts 2:1-4; 10:44-47; 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today this all-inclusive Spirit is already upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I truly believe that as I am speaking to you the Spirit of the Lord is upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I also believe that the Spirit of the Lord is not only upon me, but also in me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all need to claim the word of the Lord by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since the Lord has said that His Spirit is poured out upon us, we should simply believe.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the same as the Lord saying that He has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To that we say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He does not need to be crucified for us again.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He has already been crucified and has already accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is a fact that has been accomplished once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All we need to do is simply to believe, and we will come into the enjoyment of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Bible also says that the Lord has already risen and ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To this we say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Again, the Bible says that we are seated with Him in the heavenlies Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To this we also say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then the Bible says that the Lord Jesus has breathed the Spirit of life as air into His believers John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To that we say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Moreover, the Bible says that after the Lord Jesus ascended to heaven, He poured out the Spirit of power upon His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To that we say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord Jesus has died for us, He has risen and ascended, and His Spirit is within us as well as upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today we do not need to seek after these spiritual facts.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>All we need to do is to seek after the experience of these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The best way to experience all these riches is to speak forth all these facts by the spirit of faith 2 Cor 4:13 .</S>
