<h2 class="head1">THE PROOF OF GOD&rsquo;S ACCOMPLISHED REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that God accomplished redemption in Christ. God became flesh and put on humanity, but not the sin associated with fallen humanity, so that He could enter into a practical union with man. In His status as a man in the flesh, Jesus Christ was put to death on the cross, bore man&rsquo;s sins, and brought humanity with Him to the cross. Through His all-inclusive death, He solved all the problems in the universe. He dealt with the sins committed by man and with the sin-committing man himself; that is, He dealt with man&rsquo;s sinful deeds and man&rsquo;s sinful nature. He also dealt with Satan and the world. Through the death of Christ on the cross, God dealt with everything that falls short of His glory and does not correspond to His righteousness and holiness so that He might be gracious to man and enable man to contact Him.</p>
<p>Through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, God redeemed fallen man and released the life of God, which He desires to give to man. He caused man to turn to Him and to receive His life. Furthermore, Christ resurrected from the dead, ascended into heaven, and entered into glory with His humanity. Through His resurrection and ascension, humanity was brought into God and into God&rsquo;s glory; thus, redeemed man can enter into a practical union with God. Now God is fully joined with man, and man is joined with Him. God entered into humanity, and He brought humanity into Himself. Through His death, resurrection, and ascension all that God is and has can be wrought into man, and man can be brought into God; hence, God and man can be joined as one. This is marvelous and mysterious. Through His death, resurrection, and ascension Christ, who is God yet man, was glorified; He brought humanity into glory. This is the glorious mystery of God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s entering into glory is the proof of God&rsquo;s accomplished redemption (Luke 24:26; Rom. 4:25). The person in glory in the heavens is both God and man; He is man yet God, and God yet man. The resurrection of Christ from the dead signaled the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal plan by issuing in a person who is God mingled with man and man joined with God. This is the result that God intended to obtain in eternity past, and it is the issue of His work in time. Hence, God&rsquo;s heart is full of joy. </p>
<p>A person who sets up a factory to mass-produce a certain product must first produce a prototype. After he has successfully produced a prototype, he can begin to mass-produce the prototype. Being able to produce a prototype is something worth cheering and rejoicing over. The resurrected and glorified Christ, who is God yet man, is the prototype of God&rsquo;s redemptive work. He is the issue of God&rsquo;s redemptive work. God can now work to mass-produce Christ as the prototype.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APPLICATION OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s redemptive work was accomplished in Christ, but He is only a prototype; He is not the mass production. God&rsquo;s intention is not to gain just one person who is joined with Him but to gain myriads of people who are joined with Him. He desires to gain many who are like Christ and who are one with Him in Christ. God wants many to have all that Christ is and has so that Christ may have many brothers as His partners and may be the firstborn Son, having the first place among many brothers for the expression of God&rsquo;s glory. Hence, all that Christ is and has accomplished is now in the Spirit for us to receive and obtain.</p>
<p>If the redemption accomplished in Christ could not have been applied to and appropriated by others, His work would have been limited to the production of only a prototype; that is, there would have been no mass production of God&rsquo;s redemptive work in us. In order for there to be a mass production of Christ, He became the Spirit to be received by those who believe (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17). Therefore, after accomplishing redemption, everything of Christ was received in the Spirit to be applied to man (John 16:15).</p>
<p>Without Christ becoming the Spirit, the redemption accomplished by God could not reach us. The accomplishments of redemption must be in the Spirit in order to reach us. All of Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments are objective facts, but they must be applied to us in the Spirit so that they can be gained and enjoyed by us as our inward, subjective experiences. Hence, God&rsquo;s redemption is not merely an outward accomplishment in Christ for us; it is the salvation that God desires to inwardly apply to us in the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit is omnipresent, invisible, and intangible; He is not limited by space, time, or matters. Everything that God has accomplished in Christ is in the Spirit in order to be applied to us. Everything that God has accomplished in Christ is in the Spirit for us to receive. God is waiting for man to receive all that He has accomplished. Therefore, when we believe and receive God&rsquo;s redemption, the Spirit applies Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments to us so that they become the salvation that is gained, experienced, and enjoyed by us. By believing and receiving, we appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
