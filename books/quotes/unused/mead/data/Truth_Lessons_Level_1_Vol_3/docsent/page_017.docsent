   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>TEXT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Following the Spirit s sanctification and man s repentance is man s believing, or man s faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genuine faith is always preceded by repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same manner, genuine repentance is always followed by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a person believes, that proves he has repented; if a person repents, he surely will believe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These two faith and repentance are intimately related, and neither can exist without the other.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I. THE MEANING OF BELIEVING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the previous lesson we saw that the repentance spoken of by the world differs in meaning from the repentance taught in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, the believing referred to by man differs in significance from the believing presented in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man considers that to believe is merely to agree or to acknowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But what the Bible speaks concerning faith indicates that it is more than agreeing and acknowledging.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. Receiving</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To believe, as taught in the Bible, first means to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 1:12 says, As many as received Him the Lord Jesus ,... those who believe in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This shows that to believe is to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, to believe is not merely to agree or to acknowledge, but even more it is to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If one assents to the gospel and agrees that the Lord Jesus died to accomplish redemption for man, one still cannot be counted as having believed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, even if one acknowledges the gospel and the redemption of Christ, one still cannot be counted as having believed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Believing includes agreeing and acknowledging; nevertheless, the believing itself is the receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A person may agree, yet he still may not receive; he also may acknowledge yet still not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But a person who receives surely is one who agrees and acknowledges.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, only when a person receives can he be counted as having believed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With our heart we must receive Christ into us to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the genuine believing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is the Word who was in the beginning and who was God Himself John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is also the true light who came into the world to enlighten every man John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now in resurrection He has become the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, by believing in Him, by receiving Him, we can receive this One, who is the Word, the very God, and the light, into us to be joined to us as one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>B. Believing into</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To believe is not only to receive but also to believe into John 1:12; 3:15-16, 36, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>. To receive is to receive Christ into us and to allow Him to be mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other hand, to believe into is to enter into Christ and be joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One who genuinely believes in the Lord Jesus is one who has entered into Him and has been joined to Him through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, the Bible says that a saved person is one who is in Christ 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Believing into the Lord s Name</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord s name denotes the Lord s Person, the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To believe into the Lord s name John 1:12 is to believe into the living Person of the Lord, to believe into the Lord Himself, to be joined to Him as one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Believing into the Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>John 3:36 and 9:35 and 38 all point out that to believe is to believe into the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the entering in. The God who dwells in unapproachable light in heaven is the Father 1 Tim 6:16; James 1:17 ; when He is manifested among men, He is the Son John 1:18; Col 1:15; Heb 1:3 ; and when He enters into man, He is the Spirit 1 John 3:24 . The Son, therefore, is the expression of God; He is God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This manifested God is the Lord Jesus, who is the Son of God, the very God Himself John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He and God are one John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Having passed through death and resurrection, He has become the life-giving Spirit who, like the air, fills all things and is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, man can enter into Him through faith to receive the eternal life John 3:36; 1 John 5:12 and have an organic union with Him.</S>
