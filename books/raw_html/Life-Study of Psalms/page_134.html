<P>In the Lord's recovery, we have been enlightened to see what God wants. God wants us to be one with Him. God lives in us, and He wants us to live Him. The writings of the apostle Paul are crystal clear on this point, with no ambiguity. The main item in Paul's fourteen Epistles is stated in Galatians 2:20: "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me." These words are divine. They have nothing to do with anything natural, religious, or superstitious.</P><P>God created Adam almost six thousand years ago. From Adam to Abraham was two thousand years, from Abraham to Christ was two thousand years, and from the time of Christ until now has been also almost two thousand years. In the first two thousand years, God visited people to help them to realize that they needed Him. In the second two thousand years, God told Abraham that in his seed all of the nations would be blessed (Gen. 22:18; 26:4). They would be blessed by God's being one with them and by their being one with God. This is altogether mysterious and divine.</P><P>Christ as the seed of Abraham came to fulfill God's promise. When Christ came, the Jews had their religious way of worshipping God according to their kind of thought. Later, the apostles had to encounter two problems&#151;the Jewish religion and Greek philosophy. This earth today is full of different philosophies from different cultures and religions. In addition to all of these philosophies, there is the philosophy and the logic in today's Christianity. Many Christians today understand the Bible according to their natural concept, not the divine concept.</P><P>In the Lord's ministry we have spoken concerning God's economy, God's dispensing, and the life-giving Spirit, the processed, consummated Spirit. We have seen that this Spirit is the compound Spirit, and this compound Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God. These things cannot be heard in the theology of today's Christianity.</P><P>Because of the opposition, I published an article in 1977 entitled What a Heresy&#151;Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods! Many of those opposing us teach that there are three Gods. This is the teaching of tritheism. They also teach that there are two divine Fathers. One is the Father in the Godhead and the other is the Father in Isaiah 9:6, whom they say is the Father of eternity. They also mistakenly say that there are two life-giving Spirits. One is the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, and the other is the life-giving Spirit mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:45b. All of these teachings, of course, are heretical.</P><P>I have been speaking in the United States for thirty years with the burden to release the central line of the divine revelation according to God's economy. But according to my realization, not many of us appreciate this central line. Before I came to the United States, I had not seen that the Spirit was the consummation of the Triune God. I began to say mainly in Hong Kong in the summer of 1954 that the death and resurrection of Christ are in the Spirit. From that year the light concerning the all-inclusive Spirit came in and has been shining brighter and brighter.</P>
