   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ITS FOUNDATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church's foundation is Christ, revealed and ministered through the apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 2:20 speaks of the foundation of the apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This foundation is the very Christ whom they ministered to others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul said that Christ was the unique foundation which he had laid.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one can lay another foundation 1 Cor 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Christ who is the foundation of the church is the unique Christ revealed and ministered by the early apostles, as recorded in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must stay with this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not take "another Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How grateful we are to the Lord that He has kept His holy Word on this earth, and that under His sovereignty it has been translated into so many languages!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What a mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there were no Bible on this earth, what a dark age this would be.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hallelujah, we have the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is surely the lamp shining in a dark place 2 Pet 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It has become the light of our pathway Psa 119:105 , and we are walking in this light the light of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ITS GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians 3:11 says there is no other foundation that can be laid except the unique foundation, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before a foundation can be laid, however, a house must have a site on which it can be built.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The lot is the ground on which the foundation is built.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the house is built on top of the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The structure is built upon the foundation, and the foundation is laid on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Catholic Church claims their foundation is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Presbyterian and Methodist Churches also claim that their foundation is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the denominations make this same claim.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their foundation, however, is built upon different grounds.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Presbyterian Church is built upon Christ on the Presbyterian ground.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Baptist Church is built upon Christ but on the ground of immersion in their water.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Methodists have a Methodist ground upon which Christ as their foundation is built.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The various denominations follow the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They build their denomination on Christ but on their particular ground.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not like to criticize, but we must speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I feel sorrowful that the Southern Baptist Church only recognizes those who are immersed in their water and by their pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If someone has been immersed elsewhere, they will not let him join them unless he accepts their immersion done by their pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This makes Baptist immersion the ground, and makes them a sect, a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Church of Christ has a similar practice, except that they believe in baptismal regeneration, that their water can regenerate those who are baptized in it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before I came to Dallas in 1966, I was invited by a brother in Los Angeles to his home for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While we were eating, a brother asked if I believed in water baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I said, "I believe in water baptism and in Spirit baptism as well."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He immediately began to argue that there was no such thing as water baptism in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I had been a Christian for forty years and had never heard any Christian say that in the New Testament there is no water baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I referred him to John 3:5 about being born of water and the Spirit, he said the water there was the water in the mother's womb!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To him everyone must firstly be born of his mother, signified by the water, and then he must be born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I had never heard such an explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The concept was so off that I felt there was no need to talk.</S>
