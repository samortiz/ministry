<h1 class="title">A DOMINATING FACTOR<br />
TO DEAL WITH OPINION</h1>
<p>Although we have spent several messages on the matter of opinion, we need to consider once more, not doctrinally but practically, how we can have no opinion. Humanly speaking, it&rsquo;s altogether impossible. We are just the embodiment of opinion. We are just opinionated. How could we as such persons have no opinion? The first point is not how to have no opinion. The first point is that we need to see a vision concerning what God wants. What does God want of you? You must see that God wants only Christ&mdash;not Christ <em>and</em> but Christ <em>with</em> the church. The church is not a strong subject, but is something subordinate. We must see that God only wants Christ with the church. I am sorry to say that thousands and even millions of Christians have not seen this and don&rsquo;t care for this. So it is impossible for them not to have opinion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A DOMINATING FACTOR</h2>
<p>Furthermore, although you may have seen this vision, it still may not have become a dominating factor in you. What you have seen as a vision must become a dominating factor in your being. You must be dominated with this fact: that God wants nothing but Christ with the church. If you could see this vision and if you could keep this as a kind of dominating factor, you will be ninety percent successful in not having opinion. This is very crucial. Actually there is no way to overcome opinion or to deal with opinion. Logically speaking we may say that we have to deal with our opinion and overcome our opinion. But experientially there is no such thing. If you have a way to overcome your opinion, that way becomes a replacing opinion. You simply replace opinion number one with opinion number two. You must see that God only wants Christ with the church. As you see this everything else drops spontaneously. I do not say that everything <em>will be</em> dropped, but everything simply drops. I do not use the passive voice but the active voice. When you see the vision that God&rsquo;s unique desire is Christ with the church, and this vision becomes a dominant factor, everything besides Christ drops. This is really true. We need such a vision.</p>
<p>Every spiritual experience always depends upon Our vision. For example we may preach against sin, but if people do not see a vision, they will simply pick up the knowledge that they are sinful and continue to do a lot of sinful things. The principle is true in every item with the spiritual experience. We need to see that God does not want anything but Christ with the church. You have to pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us.&rdquo; To advise people not to have opinion is altogether not workable. It is impossible. But if the church is under the light, the vision is here. You see that what God wants is nothing but Christ Himself. He does not want your spirituality, your holiness, your prayer, not even your good virtue. He does not want your ability, your capability, your wisdom, your cleverness, your skill, or your patience. You have to see the vision that Christ is everything. This is the main factor that cuts all the roots of anything other than Christ. Opinion may be considered as the main thing among all the things other than Christ. Don&rsquo;t think that if you simply understand what I am saying you have gotten it. No! This depends upon the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. Out of the nine hundred people who are here in this meeting, if only fifty percent could get into this vision, it would be marvelous. You all need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">A VISION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>First, if you would see such a vision you must have a humble heart, an open mind, and be poor in spirit. You must hold a kind of attitude, aspiring for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. Then you will see the vision. Learn not to reject even a little enlightenment. Just a little rejection covers your whole being. Be humble, be open, and be pure. Hold an attitude of needing and desiring the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. Then the light will come. We have given many messages through the years that Christ in God&rsquo;s economy is all in all. Christ is the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy. Christ is the hub and Christ is the rim of God&rsquo;s purpose. Whatever God is, is just Christ. We all need to see this. I realize that you know this and you have heard this but it must become a vision to you. You may know it but still not have a vision that Christ is all in all. When you see this, everything besides Christ drops.</p>
