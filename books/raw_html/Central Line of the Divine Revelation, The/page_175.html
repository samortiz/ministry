<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Through the Spirit as the Firstfruits Dispensing<br>the Divine Essence into the Believers' Entire Being</H2><P>God's conformed sons are glorified through the Spirit as the firstfruits dispensing the divine essence into the believers' entire being (Rom. 8:23). God has given the Spirit to us as the firstfruits, the foretaste, of our enjoyment of God as our inheritance. Today we are enjoying God as a foretaste, not as a full taste. While we are enjoying the Spirit as our foretaste, He is dispensing the divine essence into our entire being. This dispensing proceeds from the initiation of His sealing to the consummation of the glorification of the believers, which will be their full taste of their enjoyment of God as their inheritance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Glorification, the Transfiguration,<br>the Redemption of the Believers' Body Being<br>the Maturity of the Divine Dispensing<br>in the Believers</H2><P>The glorification, the transfiguration, the redemption of the believers' body is the maturity of the divine dispensing in the believers, beginning from their regeneration and proceeding through the entire course of their spiritual life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Glorification of the Believers<br>Being the Consummation of the Accomplishment<br>of God's Full Redemption and Salvation in Christ</H2><P>The glorification of the believers is the consummation of the accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ and the full qualification for the chosen people of God to be fully mingled with the processed Triune God and to enjoy Him in full for eternity, as signified by the New Jerusalem as the full consummation of God's eternal salvation by the divine dispensing (Rev. 21:1&#151;22:5).</P>
