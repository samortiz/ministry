   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Revelation 14:11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And the smoke of their tormenting goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This shows us that once a person goes to hell, there will no longer be any chance for repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moreover, one does not perish immediately when he goes into hell.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The saints will not need to sleep in the new heaven and the new earth, while those in hell will not be able to sleep forever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>C. Revelation 14:12</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse corresponds with 13:10.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"The commandments of God" refer particularly to the first and the second commandments: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me," and "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the time for the believers to exercise their endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>V. BLESSED ARE THE DEAD WHO DIE IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>REVELATION 14:13</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"From now on" refers to the time after the worship of the beast begins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that one can escape the persecution of the beast by death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those "who die in the Lord" must be the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here it does not say the seven Spirits of God, but the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit is directly related to the church, while the seven Spirits are directly related to His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our works cannot go before us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, Christ's work goes before us to God and secures for us God's acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our works follow us to God and bring to us God's reward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE REAPING OF THE HARVEST</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>REVELATION 14:14-16 A. Revelation 14:14</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"And I saw, and behold, there was a white cloud, and on the cloud One like the Son of Man sitting, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"A white cloud" here agrees with 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"One like the Son of Man" is a word related to the church Rev 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Having a golden crown" signifies having obtained glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sickle has to be sharp so that the reaping can be done quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Matthew 13:37, the Lord is the Sower; at His second coming, He will be the Reaper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. Revelation 14:15-16</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Send forth Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come because the harvest of the earth is ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 15 we have the angel sent from God speaking to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here the Lord takes the position of a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Matthew 9:38 the Lord says that God is the Lord of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here the Lord is a sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Harvest."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Mr. Darby does not recognize that Christians can pass through these judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, he thinks that the harvest here refers to something negative.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, nowhere in the entire Bible is harvest referred to in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The wheat is not like the fig, which can remain on earth for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once it has ripened, it must be harvested.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first time that the harvest is mentioned in the Bible is in Genesis 8:22.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There it clearly indicates that the harvest is a blessing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In John 4:35 the Lord refers to the harvest in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Matthew 3:12 says that the wheat should be gathered into the barn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Exodus the firstfruits of the harvest should be gathered into the house of God 23:19; 34:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be gathered into the house of God typifies the initially-raptured Christians being taken to the throne of God, while to be gathered into the barn typifies the majority of the believers being raptured to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The barn is between the field and the house.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The field refers to the world Matt 13:38 , while the house refers to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, the Christians who are gathered into the barn are those who are raptured to the air, which is between the heavens and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The harvest in Matthew 13:37-43 is a reaping of what the Lord has sown.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What the Lord has sown is something good; hence, what is reaped must also be good.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Mark 4:26-29, God is reaping because the time of harvest has come.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Romans 11:16 says that if the firstfruits are a certain way, the whole lump is also.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since the firstfruits in Revelation 14:1-5 are good, the harvest in verses 14 through 16 must be good also.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since verses 1 through 5 do not refer to the judgment of the sinners, verses 14 through 16 should not refer to something negative; they cannot refer to God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The word "ripe" can be translated "dried up."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The immature grain will not be harvested.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Likewise, the immature Christians will not be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The firstfruits are composed of those who ripen first, those who forsake the world first.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is only after the worldly Christians have been dried up of the world that they will no longer love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Matthew 13:39 says that the angels are sent to reap the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The sickle in Revelation 14:14 is in the Son of Man's hand; it is a mysterious sickle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the Lord comes to receive us, we will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then, we will "stand before the Son of Man" Luke 21:36 .</S>
