   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is difficult to understand faith in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Acts 6:7 we are told that many priests were obedient to the faith, and in 2 Timothy 4:7 Paul says that he kept the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Jude 3, we must contend for the faith once delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, Paul charged the deacons to hold the mystery of the faith 1 Tim 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can define faith in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may say that faith is a camera which photographs the scenery of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Faith is also the reflection of grace, and it is the appreciation of grace with the calling, receiving, accepting, joining, partaking, and enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. God s Principle in Dealing with Man</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>in His New Testament Economy</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as the law was the basic principle according to which God dealt with His people in the Old Testament, faith is the basic principle according to which He deals with people in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All those who refuse to believe in Christ will perish, whereas those who believe in Him will be forgiven of their sins and receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In John 16:9 we are told that the Spirit will convict the world concerning sin because of not believing in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that the unique sin which causes people to perish is unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s commandment to sinners is to believe in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament the term faith is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It has both a divine aspect and a human aspect, for it implies something on God s side and something on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On God s side, the term the faith implies that God sent His Son to earth, that Christ died on the cross to accomplish redemption, that He was buried and was resurrected, that in resurrection He released the divine life and has become the life-giving Spirit all that He might enter into all those who believe in Him to be grace, life, power, sanctification, and everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On our side, faith is related to hearing, appreciating, calling, receiving, accepting, joining, partaking, and enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, faith involves rejoicing, thanking, praising, and overflowing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Faith hears and appreciates.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Faith calls, receives, and accepts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Faith also joins, partakes, enjoys, rejoices, gives thanks, and praises.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, faith results in the overflow of life from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not have faith, all that has been accomplished on God s side will remain objective and not be personally related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need our faith to function as a camera to photograph the scenery of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For faith to operate in this way implies that we apprehend the divine scenery by hearing, appreciating, calling, receiving, accepting, joining, partaking, enjoying, rejoicing, thanking, praising, and overflowing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Faith is actually the all-inclusive Triune God infused into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This infusion takes place as we are under the preaching of grace and hear the word of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the processed Triune God is infused into us, He becomes our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This faith is the reflection of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, grace and faith, faith and grace, are two ends of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Neither grace nor faith has anything to do with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today God deals with people not according to law, but according to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to keep this faith, turn to it, obey it, and contend for it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>B. The Principle by Which</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God Dealt with Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 3:6, 7, and 9 we see that faith was the principle by which God dealt with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 9 says, So that they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Under God s dealing, Abraham was not working to please God; instead, he was believing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>C. Our Believing in Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Taking His Person and Redemptive Work</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>as the Object of Our Faith</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, faith is our believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other hand, it is our taking Christ s Person and redemptive work as the object of our faith John 3:36; Acts 16:31; Rom 16:26; 2 Tim 4:7b; Jude 3, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>D. Replacing Law</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Faith replaces law Gal 3:23, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since faith has come, we should not stay with the law any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The law kept us and brought us to Christ, but now in our experience it should be replaced by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>E. Bringing Us into the Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Promised to Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have pointed out that 3:9 says that they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Faith brings us into the blessing God promised to Abraham, that is, to the all-inclusive land which typifies the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, faith in Christ brings us the promise of the Spirit 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>F. Ushering Us into Christ</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, faith ushers us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to John 3:15, everyone who believes in Christ, or into Christ Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>, has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>G. Characterizing the Believers in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>and Distinguishing Them from the Keepers of Law</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Finally, faith characterizes those who believe in Christ, and it distinguishes them from those who keep the law Acts 6:7; 1 Tim 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are not keepers of law we are believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are the people of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 3:7 and 9 Paul speaks of those who are of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to both Darby s New Translation and the Chinese version, this expression denotes the principle of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These versions adopt the rendering on the principle of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To be of faith means to be on the principle of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are those who take faith as our principle.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Everything we do should be in keeping with this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>By this principle we come to Christ, receive Him, and become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Galatians 3:23 and 25 say that faith has come.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is another strong expression.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Once we were guarded under law, but now faith has come.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This means that the processed Triune God as grace has come.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The coming of faith also includes the coming of appreciation, receiving, and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the faith which replaces law!</S>
