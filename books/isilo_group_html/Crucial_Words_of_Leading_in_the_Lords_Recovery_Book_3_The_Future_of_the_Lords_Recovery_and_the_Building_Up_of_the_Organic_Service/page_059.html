<h1 class="title">LEADING CONCERNING<br />
THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we are still natural and in the old creation; we are even in the self and in the flesh. We need Your cleansing. We take You as our sin offering and as our trespass offering. We thank You for Your redeeming blood, which cleanses us and keeps us in constant fellowship with You. We have received Your mercy and Your grace not for our own work nor for our own future nor for our own living. Your mercy and Your grace are for You, for Your interest on the earth, and for Your move on the earth.</p>
<p>Lord, we worship You from the depths of our being for choosing us before the foundation of the world and for setting us apart. You called us in time, and You gathered us together. We look to You and beseech You to save us from our natural man, from our natural zeal, from our concepts, from our religious thoughts, and even from our natural, pious ideas. Lord, save us from our hidden self and from our self in disguise.</p>
<p>We are not here learning ways and methods. We are here because we want to know You and Your ways. Lord, open the heavens to us and bring us into Your heart&rsquo;s desire so that our feelings come from You. Lord, have mercy on us and deliver us from our natural concepts. We need Your Spirit in us to daily give us the light from heaven, the light in the Holy Place, and even the revelation in the Holy of Holies. Bring us into Your light so that we would know ourselves and understand our history. We need to know our past and to understand our failures. Even more, we need to confess our mistakes.</p>
<p>Lord, we beseech You, be with us in every meeting, and cause our speaking to touch Your heart&rsquo;s desire. Give us a clear sense. Anoint our spirit with Your feeling, with Your thoughts, and with Your words, and grant us Your utterance. We need Your anointing and Your transfusing. We need to practically be one spirit with You. You have become one spirit with us, and we have become one spirit with You. We know that this is an accomplished fact, but we still want to experience the reality of being one spirit with You and of having You speak in our speaking. You are mingled with us; divinity is mingled with humanity, and the human spirit is joined to the divine Spirit. Lord, care for us, care for Your recovery, and care for Your move on the earth.</p>
<p>Grant us a model in Taiwan. Cause us to be faithful to You. We bend our knees to You and ask You to strengthen our entire being into the inner man so that we would give You the ground and the opportunity to make Your home in our deepest parts. Lord, gain our inward parts, and also gain our deepest parts. Speak to us. We are waiting on You and expecting You to cover us and to resist the enemy on our behalf. We proclaim again Your victory by Your prevailing blood. This blood does not merely speak better things for us before God. Your blood also speaks before the enemy. Your precious blood resists the enemy and covers us. We ask You to draw the line so that the enemy has no opportunity or ground to do anything here.</p>
<p>Lord, do not allow the enemy to have any ground in our environment or in our hearts. Bind him. We bind Your enemy in Your victorious name. By faith we trample beneath our feet the evil one&mdash;Your enemy, the devil&mdash;who accuses us. We proclaim Your victory and the victory of Your recovery and of Your move. Subdue the devil and bring the world under Your headship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT REMAINING IN OLDNESS<br />
BEING A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has more than sixty years of history among us. Through many experiences and failures during this time, we have learned that a characteristic of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not remaining in oldness but constantly being renewed.</p>
<p>Those who serve the Lord must learn the lesson of not remaining in oldness. Oldness includes many items. In fact, whatever is not of the Lord is old. Not remaining in oldness means that we do not remain in anything apart from the Lord, regardless of whether it is good or bad. We want nothing apart from the Lord. As long as we hold on to something other than the Lord, we are in oldness. We should not consider this to be an insignificant matter. In our natural man there are many hidden elements of oldness. We all remain in oldness. The elderly saints are not the only ones who can be in oldness; even two-year-old children can be in oldness. Everything apart from the Lord is old. Everything apart from the Lord is rubbish and must be thrown away. Even our former understanding of the Bible is old. If we insist on keeping our former understanding of the Bible, we will remain in oldness, and God&rsquo;s light cannot enter into our being.</p>
<p>Many of us have received mercy to serve the Lord full time. Some of us do not have the circumstances that allow us to serve full time and can serve only part time. But we are all for the Lord. When we are not for the Lord, we are not aware of the old things in our being. However, as soon as we are for the Lord, we must be careful, because our entire being is full of oldness. Fifty years ago I was like many of the young people. As soon as I began to love the Lord, I became zealous. However, even though the Lord has been doing a cleansing work for the past fifty years, I have to confess that there are still many old things within me.</p>
<p>We should never think that only the elderly saints have old and stale things within them; even the younger saints have old things. The younger saints have many ideas, opinions, views, and methods, just as the older saints do. It is difficult to find two sisters among us who are truly in one accord. Even though the sisters may be one in their spirit when they pray, they do not have the same heart. They have the same spirit but not the same heart. There are many sisters in every locality, but who can say with confidence that she is in one accord with another sister? This is our condition: we are one in spirit but not one in our heart. A saint who does not serve the Lord full time has fewer opportunities to be exposed for being in disaccord, but as soon as he begins to serve full time, his discord is easily exposed. If there are six hundred full-time serving ones, there will be six hundred different hearts.</p>
<p>Some saints have served the Lord full time for many years, but it is still difficult for them to be in one accord. This matter is grievous, and it is not easily resolved, because the factor behind our lack of one accord is our oldness. Our views, feelings, knowledge, and even the lessons we have learned can become old. Since the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have been tearing down the old things. We must put aside all the old things. We need to empty ourselves before the Lord and allow Him to speak to us and reveal our oldness so that nothing would hinder us from receiving His leading. Oldness can be compared to layer after layer of heavy veils that cover us. We must remove them.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord's Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
