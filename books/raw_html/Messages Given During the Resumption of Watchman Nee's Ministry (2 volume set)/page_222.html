<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Release of our Inward Man<br>to Touch Others' Inward Man</H2><P>Never think that as long as you say the right thing and the proper words, you will be all right. There is another question: whether the words you say come from your outward man or your inward man. We can only blame the co-workers for the condition of the brothers in Kiangsu. A person whose outward man has not been broken may use the same terms and may speak the same thing; his words may even mean the same thing. Yet you cannot touch anything in the words he speaks. If we want to serve others, our outward man must be broken. Only when the outward man is broken can the inward man be released. Only when our inward man comes out can we touch others' inward man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Extent the Outward Man Is Broken<br>Determining the Amount of Ministry One Has</H2><P>A man who is capable of thinking and scheming, and who is clever in his mind, is not very useful in spiritual things. You may speak something with a smile, or you may speak the same thing with tears. The issue is not how you speak it; the issue is how much of your inward man is released. Today, the extent a man is broken determines the amount of ministry he has. We all have to be dealt with by the Lord in these matters. We love to meet some whose outward man is broken. Once you see such people, you touch their inward man. The purpose for which we are disciplined and restricted is that our outward man may be broken. A man can be talking about sad things on the platform, yet he himself does not feel sad at all. He can be talking about happy things, yet he himself does not feel any joy. This kind of person can only perform; he cannot preach. Some people are so hard in their outward man that whatever others say, they have no response. They are like the men at the time of John the Baptist, who would not dance when others played the flute and would not sing when others rejoiced (Matt. 11:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>No Short Cut</H2><P>The basis of a man's ministry is his knowledge before God. But whether or not the ministry can be released depends on whether or not the outward man is broken. When we began to learn to be a minister of the word, we learned to have the proper knowledge before God. However, the more we go on, the more we have to see that there can be no real ministry unless the outward man is broken. If the rubber tree is not cut, the sap will not flow out. It is impossible for a person who has no wound in him to have a ministry with him. There is no short cut. Some people still do not know even today what it means to utter something from his inward man.</P><P>Never forget that a man can only have a certain ministry if he is dealt with by the Lord. After a man has been dealt with, his spirit will be more pure. Whether or not a man's spirit can be released depends fully on whether or not he has been dealt with. At the same time, whether or not a man's spirit is clean depends on whether or not he has been dealt with. Once the outward man is broken, the inward man can be released, and a person's word will be able to reach others' hearts. Many people think that as long as a person can help others to become excited and can bring in an exciting atmosphere, everything will be all right. But those who have never been cut open in their outward man will not be of much use. The Christian service is based on brokenness. The degree of brokenness and the amount of wounding determine the amount that will be released.</P><P>How should a man speak in order that his spirit can be released? The only way for his spirit to be released is for his outward shell to be broken. Whether or not a man's outward shell is broken determines whether or not his inward spirit is released. If a man wants to have a spirit that can be used, his outward man must be smitten. At the time we are regenerated, the Lord comes into our spirit. At that time, our spirit is like the Holy of Holies; it is full of light and life. However, whether or not the Lord can be released depends on whether or not our outward man is broken. If the outward man is broken, no outward things will become hindrances to us any longer. On the contrary, they will all become outlets for the spirit to be released. If our mind and emotion are broken, they will no longer become the hindrance to the flow of life anymore. On the contrary, they will all become the channels for the inward man to be released. After a man has been broken, his mind and emotion will become the gateway for his inward man to go out. Every city in the world has only four gates. Only the New Jerusalem has twelve gates (Rev. 21:12). Whether Christ can be released from us depends on whether or not we have been broken.</P>
