<h2 class="head2">B. We Must Believe</h2><p>After we have surrendered, we must believe that God can surely save us from our love, our unwillingness, and our inabilities. Psalm 37:5 says, "Commit your way to Jehovah, /And trust in Him; and He will act." To commit is to surrender, and to trust is to believe. The result of surrendering and believing is that He will act. We cannot do anything except commit ourselves to God and believe that the indwelling Lord will accomplish His purpose.</p><p>Can you say, "I have overcome"? Hallelujah! I can say that I have overcome because the Bible tells me so. What a pity, not only is our faith not as big as a grain of mustard seed; it is not even as big as a speck of dust! If we have faith, God will operate. God used only the word of His mouth to create the heavens and the earth; when He said, "Let there be light," there was light. If we have faith, God will operate, because it is God who will accomplish His work.</p><p>A few weeks ago a brother came to me and said that he could not overcome three or four sins. Sometimes he even wanted to commit suicide. I asked him, "Do you believe that Christ can save you from your sins?" He answered, "I believe." Then he said, "But I commit these sins again and again. I have overcome all other sins, but I cannot overcome these few." I read Romans 8:1 with him. "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus." I said to him, "The Bible says that there is a condition for being saved, which is to be in Christ Jesus. Are you in Christ Jesus?" He responded, "Yes." The Bible says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death" (v. 2). I asked, "Are you free?" He said, "The Bible says I am free from the law of sin and of death, but I dare not say it." Then I said, "Where is your faith?"</p><p>I am not afraid of man's weakness, corruption, or sins. But I am afraid of those who do not believe in God's Word. How precious are the words "has freed"! God's Word says "has freed"; it does not say "will free." Do we believe?</p><p>Christ has died for us. As long as we believe in Him, we have eternal life. What more evidence do we need? The Bible has said it. The Bible has also said, "The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." I am already free and already delivered from the law of sin and of death. Even if there are a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand sins, I am delivered from them all. I am also delivered from the spiritual death that comes from Adam.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, do you believe this word? Do you believe that you are already delivered from the law of sin and of death? The Bible says that you have been delivered. If you believe, you will say, Hallelujah! Praise God! God's Word says that you are delivered from the law of sin and of death! Do you have certain sins or unclean thoughts which you cannot overcome? If so, please know that there is a gospel for you today: the law of the Spirit of life has freed you in Christ Jesus from all kinds of sins.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we must see that surrendering and believing work interdependently. Once these two things are linked together, we will certainly overcome and not fail. It is impossible to overcome merely by believing, without committing one's life to the Lord in exchange for the life of Christ. It is true that we received everything at the time of regeneration. But if our will does not cooperate to commit ourselves to God and if we do not allow Christ to live through us, God will not force us to do anything. On the other hand, if we merely surrender but do not believe, the surrendering is only a dead work. Although one is prepared to grant God the opportunity to work, he has not yet granted God the opportunity to come in.</p><p>We must: (1) lift up our head to say to God, "I commit my all to You; I am willing to let You work," and (2) believe that God has accomplished everything according to His Word.</p><p>Christ has fought all the battles for us. The government is upon His shoulders (Isa. 9:6). Day by day we only have to believe in Him this way. Faith is something continual, while surrender is only needed once; once it is done it is settled forever. (While it is true that some people surrender gradually and slowly, this is not at all necessary.) We can commit everything to God in an instant; there is no need to repeat such an act. Since we have committed everything to Him, we should believe that God will cause Christ to live out His holiness and victory through us. Formerly, salvation involved being delivered from the judgment of hell; now, salvation involves being delivered from the authority of sin. There is no need to do anything else; all we have to do is commit and believe. I hope that everyone of us can testify to our victory.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, all we have to do is believe. Unbelief profits nothing; belief brings in change. God has spoken. We have to praise and thank Him! We should believe calmly, without depending on any feeling. God has spoken and that is it. We have not seen heaven and hell; however, we believe that there is heaven and hell because of God's Word. As long as we believe, there is no need of further proof. Only one proof is needed&mdash;the Word of God; there is no need of other proof. We do not have to see if we have changed. We only need to believe that what God has spoken counts. If we believe, there will be change. If we do not believe, we will see no change.</p><p>Once, I shared Romans 8:2 with a brother and asked him if he believed. He said, "I believe." I asked him again, "If you rise up tomorrow morning and sin again, what will happen? Suppose you still sin, what will you do?" He did not know how to answer. Brothers and sisters, the greatest danger is the first temptation that comes along the way. Satan will say, "Your surrendering and believing was in vain. Have you not sinned again? Are you any different from before? You are still the same!" But brothers and sisters, I have said this and I want to say it again: "Faith is always long-lived. Anything that is short-lived is not faith. Of everything in this world, faith survives the longest." Trials may come, but as long as God says you are victorious, you will certainly overcome and the trials will fail. How you deal with the first temptation will prove whether or not you have faith.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said to the disciples, "Let us go over to the other side" (Mark 4:35). Later there "arose a great windstorm, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already beginning to fill up....And they woke Him and said to Him, Teacher, does it not matter to You that we are perishing? And having awoken, He rebuked the wind and said to the sea, Be silent! Be still! And the wind ceased and there was a great calm. And He said to them, Why are you cowardly in this way? How is it that you do not have faith?" (vv. 37-40). Since the Lord commanded them to go over to the other side, they would certainly arrive there. Even if the waves were greater, they would not have stopped them from reaching the other side. Brothers and sisters, the most important thing is to believe the Word of God. God has spoken; this is sufficient; do not care for anything else.</p>
