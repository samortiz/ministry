<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ELDERS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Helping Others to Solve Their Problems</H2><P>In serving the Lord, everyone will sooner or later have some problems. These problems come from many areas. For example, some sisters have a genuine desire to serve. They have been helped through the previous eight points. Yet their husbands are very much opposed to them. This is a problem. As far as their husbands' opposition is concerned, they can only stay at home and cannot come to the meeting or to the services. How are you going to help such a one with her problem?</P><P>Take for example another brother who has the genuine calling to serve full-time. Yet he has a problem with his job. Should he continue with his job? Should he drop his job right away, or should he still continue in the job? It is true that this is a question between him and God, but you can see that he needs help here.</P><P>Another case is that of a brother whom you may feel is really suitable to be an elder. According to his experience of grace and his condition in life, he is a good candidate to be an elder. Yet his job takes up all of his time from morning till evening. As a result, there is no way for him to serve as an elder. How are you going to help him solve this problem of time?</P><P>Again, there are other brothers and sisters who can serve and who should at the same time continue a job, yet their incomes are not enough for them to live by. What should be done? Perhaps you can talk spiritually, saying, "Look to the Lord! Have faith!" I dislike this kind of light-hearted spiritual talk. The problem is still there. You have to help them solve the problem.</P><P>Again, there are those who really have a heart for the Lord and have learned some spiritual lessons, but they have some problem with their health. Their income is inadequate to provide an adequate diet. How are you going to help them to solve their problem? We cannot give some spiritual advice in the way of a spectator who is not involved. This is useless, and it will never help others. This is not to say that we should not trust in God, but there are some things that we should do ourselves. For this reason, we need to help the brothers and sisters solve their problems. It is not an easy matter to manage a church. If we do not do any of the things we have mentioned, we can still be an elder. But if we are to manage thoroughly, all these matters are things to be considered.</P>
