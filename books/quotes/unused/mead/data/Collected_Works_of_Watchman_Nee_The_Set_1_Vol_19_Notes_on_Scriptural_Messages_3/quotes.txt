[1]  CONTENTS NOTES ON SCRIPTURAL MESSAGES 3 The Blood and a Worship That Draws Nigh to God Issue No.
[2]  Today we will speak a little on the way to worship God.
[3]  When we come before God, some people may come with a depressed feeling.
[4]  Others think that because they have not performed well and have done many things that displease God, they cannot come to God to worship Him.
[5]  This verse tells us that our coming to God is in nothing else other than the blood of the Lord Jesus.
[6]  If you think that the blood of the Lord Jesus is not enough for you to draw near to Him, I will tell you honestly that you will never be able to come to Him or worship Him.
[7]  If there is a meeting where the blood is replaced with good works or spiritual experience and where there is trust in these things to come to God, this worship is not acceptable to God.
[8]  We say that the Lord Jesus is the High Priest; it is true that He is our High Priest before God in heaven and that we are all individual priests.
[9]  THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE CORPORATE Issue No. 45 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:13; Rom 9:3; 1 John 4:7; James 4:7; Eph 5:22-24; 1 Cor 12:25; Eph 5:21; Hosea 7:8
[10]  During the past few days I have been paying attention to one thing, which is what a Christian has to be in order to be a cake that is turned.
[11]  James 4:7 tells us to be subject to God, and Ephesians 5:21 tells us to be subject one to another.
[12]  On one hand, we have to be subject to God, and on the other hand, we have to be subject to one another.
[13]  IN THE NEW TESTAMENT Issue No. 46 Scripture Reading: Acts 9:20-28; Matt 4:18-22; Eph 1:22-23; 2:22; 1 Pet 2:3-5; 1 John 2:12-13; John 21:18, 21; Acts 28:23; 2 Tim 1:15; 2 Pet 2:1; 1 John 4:1; 2 John 7
[14]  Before we speak about what Peter represents, let us consider the difference between Peter, Paul, and John.
[15]  Even though we may speak a little here and a little there, and even though it may not be very organized, nevertheless, what we say is very crucial.
[16]  If we look at Matthew 16 and Acts 2, we know that what he did concerned only one thing the kingdom of God.
[17]  God had to send Peter to the house of Cornelius.
[18]  God also wanted him to open the door for Gentiles to enter into the kingdom of God.
[19]  In the books to the Corinthians, Paul went on to tell us what we should do after we have become subject to God and have entered into God's kingdom.
[20]  Let us consider how these three lines begin and end. What was Peter doing when God called him? He was casting a net into the sea with his brother Andrew.
[21]  O brothers and sisters, because all things have failed and the church has outwardly fallen into desolation and division, may God grant us grace so that we can turn back to John.
[22]  This does not mean that the works of Peter and Paul are not needed, but at the present time, the urgent need is not for outward things.
[23]  THE NUMBERING OF SPIRITUAL DAYS Issue No. 47 Scripture Reading: Gen 4:17-22; 5:4-21; 11:31-32; 12:4; 16:16; 17:1, 25; 25:7; 35:28-29; 47:9, 28; Exo 12:2; Lev 27:3-7; Deut 1:2; Josh 14:10; Matt 20:3, 6; John 13:30; 1 Cor 3:1-2; Acts 13:36; Rev 2:10; 3:11; 1 Kings 6:1 cf.
[24]  Our goal is to see what God says about time and how He numbers our spiritual days.
[25]  If the Israelites had not left Egypt, if they had not escaped from the bondage of Pharaoh, if they had not struck the blood on their door posts and escaped the punishment of God, they would not have had a first month before God.
[26]  One day I was conversing with a brother, and I asked him a question.
[27]  It was strange that Paul asked Timothy, who was quite young, to ordain elders.
[28]  You may be sixty years of age but have had only one month before the Lord; or you may be twenty years of age and have had only ten years before the Lord.
[29]  Even if we have been redeemed and belong to God, if we are entangled by the world and sold to Moab, the days in which we do not freely serve the Lord are days when we cannot be considered as God's children, and they cannot be counted.
[30]  Remember how Paul spoke to the Corinthians: "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.
[31]  I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it.
[32]  This matter is not only mentioned in the New Testament but is exemplified in the Old Testament.
[33]  According to Acts 7, when Abraham was in Mesopotamia, that is, Ur, God appeared to him and charged him to leave his country, his kindred, and his father's house to go into Canaan.
[34]  It is most interesting to see the journey that the Israelites took in the wilderness.
[35]  Recall the fact that the Israelites' journey from Egypt to Kadesh took only two years.
[36]  When we see that a believer is living a foolish life, we make excuses for him, by saying, "Since he has only believed in the Lord for three or five years, how can he do what he is supposed to do?"
[37]  Today we are going to study a certain subject or, we may also say, a certain thing.
[38]  Every man has these things, but he does not have them all the time.
[39]  If you give your love to someone who cannot shed tears, you will be as disappointed as if you asked a pickpocket to keep your purse for you.
[40]  If you study biology, you will find out that the eyes are like a pair of glasses.
[41]  They need to be cleaned and washed often, or else they will not be transparent.
[42]  Similarly, in the spiritual world, the spiritual eyes of those who do not shed tears must not have been washed.
[43]  Although we have served Him faithfully, He not only did not favor us with His grace, but He allowed our child to die."
[44]  However, in general, tears result from excessive sorrow, when too much psychological pressure is applied to our being.
[45]  He said, "When all your ways are blocked, when you are opposed in every place, when everyone says you are wrong, and when the environment vexes you, drop a few tears before God.
[46]  If you can shed tears whenever you want to, those tears lose their meaning and value.
[47]  If you say that you have never shed any tears, you must be a heartless person and cannot possibly be a Christian.
[48]  Do you know that tears can bring a person to the Lord Jesus and draw a person closer to the God in heaven?
[49]  Psalm 39:12 says, "Hear my prayer, O Jehovah;/And hearken to my cry;/Do not hold Your peace at my tears./ For I am a stranger with You,/A sojourner, as all my fathers were."
[50]  The best way to receive God's answer to our prayer is to pray with tears before Him.
[51]  We can tell the Lord that we are not here for long, that we are only sojourners and strangers, and that we have suffered long enough on this earth.
[52]  Second Kings 20:5-6 says, "Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold,...I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake."
[53]  But being unable to shed tears before God is an indication that we have become just a piece of stone and wood, and that we are insensitive.
[54]  Now let us consider the relationship of tears to the Lord's work and their place in His work.
[55]  Jeremiah 9:1 says, "Oh, that my head were waters,/And my eye a fountain of tears,/That I might weep day and night /For the slain of the daughter of my people!"
[56]  Verse 17 of chapter thirteen says, "And if you will not hear it,/My soul will weep in secret places for your pride;/And my eye will weep bitterly and shed tears,/ Because the flock of Jehovah has been taken captive."
[57]  Second Corinthians 2:4 says, "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that you would be made sorrowful but that you would know the love which I have more abundantly toward you."
[58]  Now let us consider what God does with our tears.
[59]  Psalm 56:8 says, "You have counted my wanderings./Put my tears into Your bottle./Are they not in Your book?"
[60]  From this we see that God remembers and counts our tears.
[61]  These two verses show us that God seems to give us tears as our food and drink, that we should eat and drink of them.
[62]  Tonight I will bring up a subject which is very important.
[63]  The Bible tells us that before He comes down to the earth, He will bring us to the heavens, after which He will come down.
[64]  Approximately one year after I was saved, I read many books written by those who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation; as a result, I thought that the whole church would be raptured before the tribulation.
[65]  Later, when I read 1 Corinthians 15 and 1 Thessalonians 4 carefully, I felt that it did not quite make sense for the whole church to be raptured before the tribulation.
[66]  First Thessalonians 1:9-10 says, "For they themselves report concerning us what kind of entrance we had toward you and how you turned to God from the idols to serve a living and true God and await His Son from the heavens, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming."
[67]  First Thessalonians 5:9-11 says, "For God did not appoint us to wrath but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us in order that whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with Him.
[68]  Jeremiah 30:6-7 says, "Ask now and see/Whether a man can give birth./Why do I see every man/With his hands on his loins like a woman about to give birth/And every face turned pale?/Alas!
[69]  For that day is great,/And there is none like it;/And it is a time of distress for Jacob,/But he will be saved out of it."
[70]  Daniel 12:1 says, "And at that time Michael, the great prince who stands for the children of your people, will arise; and there will be a time of distress, such as never occurred since there came to be a nation until that time; and at that time your people, every one found written in the book, will be delivered."
[71]  From this, they contend that the great tribulation is coming to the Jews only and not to the church, because the church is not the house of Jacob or the people of Israel.
[72]  If this verse can be quoted as evidence that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation, then "the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away" Acts 8:39 can also be quoted as evidence that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.
[73]  If the twenty-four elders represent the whole church sitting in the heavens, can God sit on the throne and the church also sit on a throne with a golden crown on her head, and Christ not sit on a throne and not have a golden crown on His head?
[74]  4 The Bible does not say that the elders' white garments have been washed in the precious blood.
[75]  In other places, when a white robe is mentioned, it says that the robe has been washed in the blood of the Lamb Rev 7:14 .
[76]  When the Bible mentions white garments, does it not refer to the righteousness of Christ?
[77]  Since the church has been washed in the blood of the Lamb, how can the elders who are not washed in the blood of the Lamb represent the church?
[78]  Revelation 4:11 says, "You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, for You have created all things, and because of Your will they were, and were created."
[79]  Revelation 5:8-10 says, "The four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb...And they sing a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, for You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made them a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth."
[80]  My 1 Thessalonians 4 only says that we will be raptured; it does not say that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation."
[81]  Revelation 3:10 says, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth."
[82]  People revile Him, but He does not beat them to death; people curse Him, but He acts as if He has not even heard them; people oppose Him, but He does not threaten them.
[83]  We have seen that the brothers who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation have reasons that are not reliable.
[84]  Our brothers say that Revelation 1 through 3 speak of the church, and that chapters three through nineteen do not speak of the church any longer, because from chapters four to nineteen the word church is not mentioned.
[85]  Although the Scripture does not explicitly say that they are the church, can we say that they are not the church?
[86]  Revelation 22:6 says, "And he said to me, These words indicating the whole book of Revelation, including chapters four through nineteen are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place."
[87]  Our brothers say that as soon as the whole church is raptured, many people will be saved on the earth who will become the so-called saints of the tribulation.
[88]  Our brothers say that during the great tribulation the Holy Spirit will no longer be on the earth, for when the Lord Jesus raptures the church to the heavens, He also raptures the Holy Spirit to the heavens, so that the Holy Spirit will no longer be on the earth.
[89]  Joel 2:28-32 says, "And afterward I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh,/And your sons and your daughters will prophesy;/Your old men will dream dreams;/Your young men will see visions./Indeed even upon the servants and the maids /In those days I will pour out My Spirit./And I will do wonders in the heavens and on earth:/Blood and fire and pillars of smoke./The sun will be turned into darkness,/And the moon, into blood,/Before the great and terrible/Day of Jehovah comes./And all who call on the name of Jehovah will be saved."
[90]  Acts 2:15-21 says, "For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is the third hour of the day; but this is what is spoken through the prophet Joel: And it shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream things in dreams; and indeed upon My slaves, both men and women, I will pour out of My Spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy.
[91]  Our brothers say that the disciples in the Gospels all refer to Jewish disciples, and not to the church, because the church was not formed until Pentecost.
[92]  The disciples were Jewish disciples, whereas we are Christians; therefore, what the Lord said in the four Gospels has nothing to do with us Christians.
[93]  It is because in the four Gospels the Lord always says to watch and prepare for His coming back, and that if one does not, he will be left behind when the Lord comes back.
[94]  At present, it suffices to say just a word of distinction: with regard to things of the environment, the Lord regarded His disciples as Jews; with regard to spiritual things, the Lord regarded His disciples as the church.
[95]  Matthew 28:20 says, "Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[96]  This word was spoken by the Lord to all the disciples when He was living on the earth.
[97]  John 14:26 says, "But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and remind you of all the things which I have said to you."
[98]  Acts 14:22 says, "Establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith and saying that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God."
[99]  Acts 19:8 says, "And he entered into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them in the things concerning the kingdom of God."
[100]  Acts 20:24-25 says, "But I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify of the gospel of the grace of God.
[101]  On the one hand, it says the gospel of the grace of God; on the other hand, it says the gospel of the grace of God is the proclaiming of the kingdom of God.
[102]  They say that the church is under grace and not under the law; therefore, all the commandments and warnings of the Lord in the Gospels do not have anything to do with the church.
[103]  The previous two times I spoke about those who advocated that the whole church would be raptured before the tribulation.
[104]  Second Thessalonians 2:1-3 says, "Now we ask you, brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, that you be not quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.
[105]  First Corinthians 15:51-52 says, "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed."
[106]  First Thessalonians 4:16-17 says, "Because the Lord Himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
[107]  Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord."
[108]  Please remember that in the Bible there are different ages.
[109]  It is only in this age that the communion between God and man is neither like that in the past nor like that in the future.
[110]  Romans 16:25-26 says, "Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel, that is, the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which has been kept in silence in the times of the ages but has now been manifested, and through the prophetic writings, according to the command of the eternal God, has been made known to all the Gentiles for the obedience of faith."
[111]  And the twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned.
[112]  If the whole church is raptured before the tribulation, then would the length of the time for the Lord to be with the church be at least three and a half years shorter?
[113]  We should remember clearly that the Bible does not say that the entire church will not pass through the tribulation; neither does the Bible say that the entire church will pass through the tribulation.
[114]  THE RAPTURE AND THE TRIBULATION 4 Issue No. 1, The Christian, Resumed
[115]  In the first two messages I spoke about those who advocate the belief that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation, and I pointed out the lack of an adequate reason and biblical basis in their arguments.
[116]  In the last message I spoke about those who advocate the belief that the whole church will go through the tribulation and showed that even though their arguments are more biblically based, they are not without flaws.
[117]  In this message we will consider whether the Bible teaches that the whole church will go through the tribulation.
[118]  Christ is now waiting for His kingdom to come.
[119]  He is also calling His believers to wait with Him and endure with Him.
[120]  While we are on earth, we should renounce all our legal rights and endure men's despising and opposition.
[121]  Those who advocate the belief that the whole church will go through the tribulation say that keeping does not refer to the rapture but to a deliverance from the tribulation only; it is merely a preservation from falling away.
[122]  For example, if this house is on fire today, and the kitchen is preserved while the rest of the house is burned to ashes, one can only say that God has provided a place in the house that keeps a person from the fire while the rest of the house is burning; God has not kept him away from the house.
[123]  These ones say that to be kept from the hour of trial means to be preserved by God in the midst of the great tribulation; it does not mean to be taken away from the tribulation.
[124]  Luke 21:36 says, "But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man."
[125]  This verse clearly says that we will not see the whole church going through the tribulation.
[126]  If we want to understand the teaching of Luke 21:36, we have to know what Luke 21 is about.
[127]  Many brothers and sisters have prayed for their daily living, parents, children, and own spirituality.
[128]  If we do not believe that the world is evil, how can we pray for deliverance from the world?
[129]  Beseeching God to deliver us from these things is to acknowledge that all these things are vanity and that the coming tribulation is a fact.
[130]  If you are a person who is watching at every time and beseeching, God will consider you worthy of being placed before the Son of Man; you will be considered worthy of being raptured.
[131]  If he is not zealous for the Lord, and finds all the heavenly things dull, he cannot blame God for not being gracious to him, for he will have no heart for heaven and will not want it.
[132]  Without the way out mentioned in Luke 21:36, it would be impossible to understand many passages of the Bible.
[133]  The rapture is a hidden thing, because the Bible says that the Lord will come as a thief Matt 24:43; 1 Thes 5:4 .
[134]  But then, on the other hand, the Bible says that we should not let the day come upon us as a thief, which means that the Lord's coming is open.
[135]  On the other hand, it says, "concerning that day and hour, no one knows" Matt 24:36 and "at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming" v. 44 . If there is only one rapture, how can you not know His coming? Since the Bible has said that He will come at the blowing of the seventh trumpet, you can find out the time of Christ's coming by counting three and a half years from the time Antichrist begins sitting in Jerusalem.
[136]  One brother said, "If, as you said, some will be raptured before the tribulation whereas others will be raptured after it, will not the church lose its hope for the rapture this way?
[137]  It is most cruel to say, as you have advocated, that a minority will be raptured first, while the majority will be left behind to pass through the tribulation before they will be raptured."
[138]  My answer is that the hope of the whole church's being raptured before the tribulation is an empty hope in any case, because the Bible never says that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.
[139]  Perhaps they will not go through the tribulation, but they will have to stand before the judgment seat and will receive their recompense, because 2 Corinthians 5:10 says, "For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad."
[140]  First Thessalonians 4:15 says, "For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep."
[141]  If one group of people will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas most of the people will be raptured at the sounding of the seventh trumpet at which time the dead will be resurrected , does this not mean that those who are living will precede those who have fallen asleep?
[142]  Therefore, there is only one thing that is sure: either we have to pass through death today, which means that we have to take the way of death, dying to the self-life and the world, so that we can be raptured, or we will have to wait for that day to pass through death.
[143]  God loves man, and He loves to forgive man's sins.
[144]  In the New Testament He appointed the Lord Jesus, who is the Lamb of God, to be the sacrifice for sin.
[145]  The Lord Jesus has shed His blood; God Himself has testified for Him that whoever believes in Him will be forgiven of their sins.
[146]  As long as we believe if we are a sinner or confess if we are a believer , God must forgive our sins.
[147]  Even when a person realizes that he has sinned and has confessed his sins to God or to man, the condition of the heart during his confession may be vastly different from one case to another!
[148]  As long as you have their forgiveness, you think that you will be reconciled to them, that they will not hate you any longer, and that their conscience will not condemn you.
[149]  If the heart does not feel that every sin against man is also a sin against God, if the blood does not seem to be that important, and if he thinks that sins have only to do with man and one only need to deal with man, he will not see the evil of sin nor consider confession as a serious matter.
[150]  This is the condition that God wants our heart to be in for our confession.
[151]  When we have this life, we have the most holy nature, a nature that is as holy as God's. Sin is something very filthy before God; it is absolutely incompatible with the holy life of God.
[152]  When God gives to us His holy life, He intends that we hate sin in the same way that He hates it.
[153]  We have to realize that when man sins, the first one he has offended is God, not man, and the One who is offended the most is God, not man.
[154]  THE POWER OF RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: Acts 13:33; 1 Cor 12:13; Eph 1:16-23
[155]  This is a great subject, and we cannot cover it fully within this limited space.
[156]  Resurrection is for God to gain a man, a man whom He has hoped to gain from the very beginning.
[157]  Our Lord was a perfect man when He was on earth, but He was limited.
[158]  If we do not see the Lord, it is not because the Lord is absent but because our physical eyes cannot see Him.
[159]  We all know that death is a great limitation.
[160]  All living creatures come to their end at death.
[161]  Therefore, if the Lord Jesus had not died for us and redeemed us from sin, His living on earth would have only been a condemnation of our sins, because we have all come short of the glory of God, and He, as a man, received God's glory and fulfilled God's glory.
[162]  The Lord Jesus had to resurrect from the dead to destroy the greatest barrier, and God had to put all things under His feet and make Him the Head over all things to the church before the church could become His Body.
[163]  We can consider the experience of the church in the first century.
[164]  In the first century, the gospel was spread by a few Galilean fishermen.
[165]  As far as their own condition was concerned, they were uneducated men of no renown, and they did not have any courage of their own.
[166]  Although Peter was the strongest among the twelve disciples, on the night of the Lord's betrayal, he would only follow the Lord from a distance.
[167]  Therefore, we need the prayer of Ephesians 1: "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him...that you may know what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead" vv.
[168]  We have to go before God and ask Him to grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we will realize that resurrection power is something for us to experience and that the church should enjoy God's resurrection power.
[169]  May the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant, richly grant the church a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that the church would truly know Christ and the power of His resurrection.
[170]  Finally, let us sing a hymn concerning the experience of resurrection:
[171]  Life out of death dear Master, is it spoken
[172]  Mark 14:9 says, "And truly I say to you, Wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her."
[173]  "For this ointment could have been sold for over three hundred denarii and given to the poor" v.
[174]  They considered it too much to serve the Lord but not too much to serve men.
[175]  If a man does not have a love for Christ, he will surely replace the love that he ought to offer to the Lord with works that he does for the Lord.
[176]  THE PATHWAY TO GLORY THROUGH JERUSALEM Scripture Reading: Luke 9:28-31
[177]  The word we should pay attention to in this passage is "Jerusalem."
[178]  I will clarify a few things first, and then I will come back to this.
[179]  The Bible records that God spoke to the Lord Jesus from the heavens three times.
[180]  The first time was when the Lord Jesus rose up from baptism Matt 3:16-17 ; the second time was on the mount of transfiguration Luke 9:28-35 , and the third time was after the Lord said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone" John 12:24-28 .
[181]  In Luke 9:27 He said clearly, "But I say to you truly, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God."
[182]  What do we see along the way to Jerusalem?
[183]  "And they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans...And they did not receive Him, because His face was set to go to Jerusalem" Luke 9:52-53 .
[184]  The Samaritans did not receive the Lord for one reason: His face was set to go to Jerusalem.
[185]  In the winter of 1927, having become clear concerning God's will that I was especially called to bear testimony to the spiritual side of the truth which excludes everything that might cause dispute regarding prophecy, the church, and Bible interpretation , I discontinued The Christian and reissued The Present Testimony.
[186]  Teachings which are in keeping with the nature of The Christian are also greatly needed, but what the Lord has not committed to me, I must wait for someone else to do.
