<p>Second, man became angry. When God had no regard for Cain&rsquo;s offering, &ldquo;Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell&rdquo; (Gen. 4:5). Those who serve God according to their own will eventually become angry. When anger is kindled in a person, this is an indication that he is serving God according to his own will. Like Cain, it is easy for such a person to become angry.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Slaying His Brother</h2>
<p>Third, Cain slew his brother. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the field. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.&rdquo; Cain initially served God, then became angry, and eventually committed murder.</p>
<p>We should not think that those who serve God would not murder others. The Lord Jesus told the disciples, &ldquo;An hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God&rdquo; (John 16:2). Serving God or sinning is not the problem. The problem is whether we serve according to God&rsquo;s will or according to our human will, that is, whether God&rsquo;s will has the ground or our human will has the ground. Our human will should have no ground in anything. Just as man is capable of sinning according to his own will, he is also capable of serving God according to his own will. On the surface it seems as though man is serving God, but the result is that he becomes angry and kills others.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Lying and Being Arrogant<br />
toward God</h2>
<p>Fourth, man lied and was arrogant toward God. &ldquo;Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I do not know. Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo; (Gen. 4:9). Cain slew his brother, but he lied to God when God asked concerning Abel. Cain was arrogant when he spoke to God. That a creature dared to speak in such a way to his Creator shows how fallen man had become. After man fell in Genesis 3, he was afraid of God, but in chapter 4 he was not afraid of God. Instead, he was arrogant toward God.</p>
<p>Most people ask, &ldquo;What was so bad about eating the fruit in the garden of Eden?&rdquo; They do not know that every unethical seed was concealed in the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Its fruit refers to Satan&rsquo;s life. Thus, the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil refers to Satan&rsquo;s life. After it entered into man, Satan&rsquo;s corrupting factor would grow out of it and eventually be lived out of man. At the beginning of chapter 4 Cain&rsquo;s service to God seemed to be in a good condition. However, his service slowly turned into anger, and he eventually slew his brother. By this time man was thoroughly corrupted. The above points are the process of man&rsquo;s second fall.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Result of Man&rsquo;s Second Fall</h2>
<p>We will now consider the result of man&rsquo;s second fall.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Greater and Severer Curse</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s second fall brought a greater and severer curse upon man. In 4:11-12 God told Cain, &ldquo;Now you are cursed from the ground...When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you.&rdquo; After the first fall the ground was cursed to bring forth thorns and thistles (3:18), but after the second fall the ground stopped yielding its strength to man. The further man fell, the more he was cursed. All the problems that man encounters are due to the curse man incurred in the fall.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being a Fugitive and a Wanderer</h2>
<p>Verse 12 of chapter 4 goes on to say, &ldquo;You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.&rdquo; Although man was driven out of the garden of Eden by God after the first fall (3:22-24), man had a fixed dwelling place. After the second fall, however, man no longer had a fixed dwelling place. Cain became a wanderer without a dwelling place.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Driven Out from the Face of God</h2>
<p>The third result of man&rsquo;s second fall is that he was driven out from the face of God (4:14). In the first fall man was driven out from God&rsquo;s dwelling place, but he could still see God&rsquo;s face. In the second fall man was driven out from God&rsquo;s face; thus, he could no longer see God&rsquo;s face. This was a very serious result.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Producing a Godless Culture</h2>
<p>The final result of man&rsquo;s second fall was the producing of a godless culture. Verses 16 through 24 of chapter 4 say, &ldquo;Cain went forth from the presence of Jehovah and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch; and he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch. And Irad was born to Enoch, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech. And Lamech took two wives for himself: The name of the first was Adah, and the name of the second Zillah. And Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and raise cattle. And his brother&rsquo;s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe. And Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice; / O wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech; / For I have slain a man for wounding me, / Even a young man for striking me. / If Cain is avenged sevenfold, / Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.&rdquo; At the beginning of chapter 4, Cain served God according to his own will. By the end of chapter 4 Cain and his descendants had invented a godless culture. When man went further away from God and lost God&rsquo;s face, he was left with only one path, a godless culture. Originally, man had God. God took care of man, and man relied on God. God was responsible for and took care of everything. Furthermore, God was man&rsquo;s joy. However, when man fell and was driven out from the face of God, he lost God. As a result, God was not responsible for man and could not take care of man as He once did. Hence, man lost his supply, joy, and security and was afraid of all the calamities that would befall him because of losing God. Therefore, man invented culture so that he could sustain, defend, safeguard, and entertain himself. This is the background of the godless human culture. Such a godless culture is the result of man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<p>The first step of Cain&rsquo;s creation of a godless human culture was the building of a city for his existence. Cain built the city of Enoch, which was the first city on earth (v. 17). It was also the beginning of building, construction, in the world. This construction was the result and the proof of man&rsquo;s departure from God. The more man sins and falls and the further he goes from God, the more he plans and builds something on the earth. Building for one&rsquo;s existence on the earth always speaks of man being far away from God. Cain built a city for self-defense because he was afraid that people would kill him. Initially, man dwelt in the garden that God had prepared, but after the fall he could only dwell in the city that he had built.</p>
<p>The second step of the creation of a godless human culture was man&rsquo;s inventing cattle-raising for his living. &ldquo;Jabal...was the father of those who dwell in tents and raise cattle&rdquo; (v. 20). Nomadic living began with Cain&rsquo;s descendant, Jabal. Such a nomadic living was the means of living in man&rsquo;s culture.</p>
<p>The third step of the creation of a godless human culture was the invention of music for entertainment. &ldquo;Jubal...was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe&rdquo; (v. 21). This proves that music played a very important role in man&rsquo;s godless culture. Music began with Jubal; it was his invention. He was born of a lust-indulging father who married multiple wives: &ldquo;Lamech took two wives for himself&rdquo; (v. 19, cf. v. 23). His mother was an ornament- and amusement-loving mother. <em>Adah</em> means &ldquo;ornament,&rdquo; or &ldquo;amusement,&rdquo; in Hebrew (vv. 20-21). The father&rsquo;s indulgence of lust, the mother&rsquo;s ornaments and amusement, and the son&rsquo;s music were the creation of the fallen human race.</p>
<p>Originally, God was man&rsquo;s joy and satisfaction. But these men did not have God as their joy or satisfaction, being far away from God and engrossed with material culture and construction. The male married multiple wives, the female adorned herself, and music was their amusement to divert their low feelings and their way to seek temporary pleasure. Modern amusements prove that man does not have God as his joy. Those who have God do not need such worldly amusements. We have drunk of the river of God&rsquo;s pleasures and no longer need to drink of the water of this world (Psa. 36:8-9; John 4:13-14).</p>
<p>The fourth step in the creation of a godless human culture was man&rsquo;s invention of cutting instruments for self-defense. &ldquo;Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron&rdquo; (Gen. 4:22). Without God&rsquo;s protection, man had to think of ways to protect himself. Some of these cutting instruments were for living and work; others were for war. Man developed industries and prospered with these cutting instruments; he also conquered others and expanded his borders by these cutting instruments.</p>
<p>Existence, amusement, and self-defense are the content of the godless human culture. Can you think of anything in human culture or living that is not included in these three categories? When man lost God, he developed these three things in order to survive. After man&rsquo;s second fall, human culture began with Cain and his descendants.</p>
<p>The consequences of developing a godless human culture are terrible. The corrupting factor is manifested at the very beginning of man&rsquo;s fall. In verse 19 there is a beginning with polygamy. This means that there was the indulgence of lust and adultery. This is the first consequence of a godless human culture. When man is away from God and engrossed in material culture and construction, he will indulge his lusts. The more human culture develops and the more advanced human construction is, the more man&rsquo;s lusts increase. The indulgence of man&rsquo;s lusts always increases with the advancement of material culture and construction. The countries with the best material culture and the cities with the best material construction often have the worst indulgence of lusts. For example, the dance ballrooms that are so prevalent in so-called civilized countries promote adulterous acts, but many highly cultured people do not sense this corruption.</p>
<p>Another consequence of developing a godless human culture is killing. Lamech said, &ldquo;I have slain a man for wounding me, / Even a young man for striking me&rdquo; (v. 23). Thus, there were many incidents of killing others. Initially, Cain killed his brother, but later, killing was pervasive among the descendants of Cain. The murderous forefather begot murderous descendants.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that the more human culture develops, the more incidents of ferocious killings there are. In the present atomic age the world has already had two world wars less than fifty years into the twentieth century. The consequence of a developed godless human culture is much killing. This is the greatest tragedy of mankind.</p>
<p>In conclusion, man&rsquo;s second fall brought a greater curse upon man, making him a fugitive and a wanderer driven out from God&rsquo;s face and completely severed from God. However, man still needed to survive; he had to build a city and sustain, entertain, and defend himself. This is the cause for man&rsquo;s invention of culture. The further away a man is from God, the more he seeks a godless culture. A godless culture demonstrates a fallen human life. Human history proves that the more advanced human culture is, the more fallen man is.</p>
<p>Man is utterly fallen when his culture does not want God. If man lived before God, human culture would want God. God would be the center and the content of such a culture. A culture with God demonstrates that man is not fallen but saved by God. All godless cultures are going downhill, following Cain&rsquo;s path.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s second fall is the result of his acting according to his own will and going further away from God. Man&rsquo;s will was also exercised to invent a godless culture. Therefore, man&rsquo;s second fall was a matter of his will versus God&rsquo;s will. Man&rsquo;s living by his own will caused him to fall a second time, and the result of man&rsquo;s going away from God&rsquo;s face was the producing of a godless culture.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God's Way of Salvation in Man's Fall &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
