OF THE PILLARS</h1>
<p>The most striking feature of the exterior of the temple built by Solomon was the two pillars (1 Kings 7:15-22). Much of what is found in the Old Testament, such as the tabernacle and the temple, is a shadow, a type. We need to know the fulfillment of all these types. Whereas the pillars in 1 Kings 7 refer to the building of the temple of God in the Old Testament, the pillars in Galatians 2:9 refer to the building of God&rsquo;s house in the New Testament, and the pillar in Revelation 3:12 refers to the New Jerusalem in the coming kingdom and in eternity. The building of God&rsquo;s house is altogether dependent on the pillars. Young people, my burden is that you realize that your responsibility is tremendous. Today we all have the golden opportunity to be perfected and to be made pillars. I believe that after a few years many of you will become pillars.</p>
<p>The pillars of the temple in the Old Testament were built by Solomon through Hiram, &ldquo;a bronze worker&rdquo; who was &ldquo;full of wisdom and understanding and skill to do all kinds of work in bronze&rdquo; (1 Kings 7:14). Solomon was a type of Christ, and Hiram was a type of the gifted person in the New Testament. That the pillars were not built by Solomon directly but by Solomon through Hiram indicates that today Christ does not build up the pillars directly but through the gifted persons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>
<p>Here we shall consider Hiram, the builder of the pillars (1 Kings 7:13-15; 2 Chron. 2:13-14). In 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles the Bible has much to say about Hiram. Although David and Solomon both prepared skillful men for the building of the temple, Hiram is the only one of these skillful builders mentioned by name. The Bible not only mentions Hiram&rsquo;s name, but also gives his background in a detailed and meaningful way, telling us of his mother and father and of Hiram himself. As we study the Bible, we must realize that it has no wasted words. Everything it stresses or repeats is meaningful. Instead of considering some verse as mere repetition, we must find the significance in each repetition.</p>
<p>When I spent much time studying the two pillars in 1 Kings 7 nearly fifty years ago, I did not see any light. I only saw that the names of the two pillars were Jachin, meaning, &ldquo;He shall establish,&rdquo; and Boaz, meaning, &ldquo;In it is strength.&rdquo; But as we have been considering Jacob&rsquo;s dream and his experience at Bethel, I began to study these two pillars again. This time a great deal of light, like the fourth-day light (Gen. 1:14-19), shined upon me. In my study of the pillars I found that many verses mention Hiram, the builder of the pillars. I knew by the speaking of the Spirit within that I had to pay attention to this. While I was considering the pillars, light also came concerning Hiram&rsquo;s mother and father, neither of whom is named in the Scriptures. I was especially bothered by the fact that, according to the Hebrew text, 1 Kings 7:14 says that Hiram was of the tribe of Naphtali. As I considered all these things further, I realized that I needed one complete message to discharge my burden on the builder of the pillars.</p>
<p>When you hear about the builder of the pillars, you may say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I could ever be a builder. As long as God&rsquo;s mercy and grace would make me a pillar, I would be more than satisfied.&rdquo; But do not be so limited. God&rsquo;s grace is unlimited. It can not only make you a pillar, but even a builder of pillars. Although I am not saying that all of us will be pillars or builders of pillars, I believe that in the coming years many, even some sisters, will become pillars. If you do not believe this word now, I would ask you to wait for several years. Then you will see many pillars raised up in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. When that time comes, I will be happy. Furthermore, I believe that a good number of us will also become Hirams, the builders of pillars. God needs these Hirams. Only one temple was built in Solomon&rsquo;s time, but today many local churches need to be built. How many Hirams will be required for this work! Every local church needs at least one Hiram. Whenever there is a Hiram in a local church, that church is in glory. Thank the Lord that He has raised up a number of Hirams in the past. But I believe that in the future the Lord will perfect many more Hirams.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS MOTHER BEING<br />
A WOMAN OF THE DAUGHTERS OF DAN</h2>
<p>Let us now see the constituent, or the constitution, of a Hiram. We need to know the constitution of those who are builders, not of the building generally, but of the pillars specifically. Firstly, Hiram&rsquo;s mother was &ldquo;a woman of the daughters of Dan&rdquo; (2 Chron. 2:14). No one can tell whether Dan here refers to the tribe of Dan or to the city of Dan. Nonetheless, it is certain that it refers to people from Dan, for the city of Dan was also of the people of the tribe of Dan. Hiram&rsquo;s father was a Tyrian, a man of Tyre, a pagan country. Hence, Hiram&rsquo;s mother was from the holy land and his father from a pagan country. As strange as it seems, the Bible further says that Hiram himself was of the tribe of Naphtali (1 Kings 7:14, Heb.). Therefore, his mother was of Dan, his father was of Tyre, and he himself was of Naphtali. How could he be of the tribe of Naphtali, since his mother was of Dan and his father of Tyre? The Bible does not tell us. It is a secret. In the light of the New Testament we may apprehend the significance of this secret. The New Testament unveils to us that we were born a sinful and worldly man. But we have been regenerated and transformed to be a man in resurrection. To be a man in resurrection by being regenerated and transformed is to be transferred into the tribe of &ldquo;Naphtali&rdquo; and to no longer be of &ldquo;Dan&rdquo; or of &ldquo;Tyre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us take the example of an elder who has been transformed. An elder should not be a gentleman, but a transformed man. Although a certain elder is the son of a woman from &ldquo;Dan&rdquo; and of a man &ldquo;Tyre,&rdquo; he must be transferred into a person from the tribe of &ldquo;Naphtali.&rdquo; In the church life the tribe of &ldquo;Naphtali&rdquo; is the tribe of transformation. Once we are in the tribe of &ldquo;Naphtali,&rdquo; we are no longer the same as our &ldquo;Danite&rdquo; mother and our &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father. You may think it is too much to say that Naphtali may be interpreted as the tribe of transformation. But read on, and surely you will be convinced that this is so. Among the twelve tribes, only one tribe, the tribe of Naphtali, is the tribe of transformation. Judah is the tribe of kingship, Levi of priesthood, and Joseph of the double portion. Naphtali is the tribe of resurrection. To be in resurrection means to be in transformation.</p>
<p>The tribe of Dan is the tribe of idolatry that caused God&rsquo;s people to stumble and fall from God&rsquo;s way. Genesis 49:17 says, &ldquo;Dan will be a serpent in the way, / A viper on the path, / That bites the horse&rsquo;s heels, / So that his rider falls backward.&rdquo; According to Judges 18, this is exactly what the Danites did. They took Micah&rsquo;s images which he had in his house and the priest whom Micah had hired to serve in his house. Judges 18:31 says, &ldquo;They set up the sculptured idol that Micah had made.&rdquo; This was the greatest stumbling to the children of Israel; it was the biting of the viper that caused the rider to fall backward. Furthermore, Jeroboam, the king of the northern tribes, set up golden calves in Bethel and in Dan to cause the children of God to stumble (1 Kings 12:28-30). Due to this, in 1 Chronicles 2 through 9, where all the other tribes of Israel are mentioned in detail, there is no mention of Dan. In these chapters Dan is cut off from the record of God&rsquo;s people. Moreover, in Revelation 7, where we have the sealing of the children of Israel, there is no mention of the tribe of Dan.</p>
<p>Let us consider further some details relating to the tribe of Dan. Genesis 49:17 says that Dan was &ldquo;a serpent in the way, / A viper on the path.&rdquo; Dan was a viper, a poisonous snake, biting the horse&rsquo;s heels, &ldquo;so that his rider falls backward.&rdquo; In the race of God&rsquo;s economy, this viper bites the horse and causes the rider to fall backward. This word in 49:17 was not spoken by a slanderer; it was uttered by Jacob as part of his blessing of his sons. When it was time to bestow his blessing upon Dan, Jacob had to be faithful to God&rsquo;s inspiration. Immediately after speaking the words recorded in 49:17, Jacob said, &ldquo;I have waited for Your salvation, O Jehovah.&rdquo; This means, &ldquo;Lord, save me from this serpent, this viper.&rdquo; In 49:16 Jacob said, &ldquo;Dan will judge his people, / As one of the tribes of Israel.&rdquo; Here, Jacob was praying that Dan might continue as a tribe. This indicated that he was in danger of being omitted. Hence, his father&rsquo;s prayer was also a prediction. God heard this prayer. In the book of Ezekiel we see that in the coming millennium the tribe of Dan will be recovered (Ezek. 48:1).</p>
<p>These details concerning Dan indicate that to be a mother who is &ldquo;a woman of the daughters of Dan&rdquo; is to be a mother in sin. All our mothers are mothers in sin. In Psalm 51:5 David said, &ldquo;In sin did my mother conceive me.&rdquo; The fact that Hiram&rsquo;s mother was of Dan indicates that his origin, like ours, was of sin. Even the apostle Paul said that he was the foremost of sinners (1 Tim. 1:15). Spiritually speaking, in God&rsquo;s eyes Paul&rsquo;s mother was also a &ldquo;daughter of Dan.&rdquo; We all must confess that our mothers are also those of &ldquo;Dan.&rdquo; If you would become a builder of pillars, you must firstly admit that you are a person born in sin. We may seem to be nice, humble, kind, gentle, and pure; but because our mother is of &ldquo;the daughters of Dan,&rdquo; our origin by birth is the origin of the serpent. In Matthew 23:33 the Lord Jesus addressed the religious ones as &ldquo;serpents&rdquo; and a &ldquo;brood of vipers.&rdquo; If you were to say to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you are no good; you are a generation of vipers,&rdquo; I would nod my head in agreement. In us, that is, in our flesh, nothing good dwells (Rom. 7:18). We all must recognize what our origin is. Our origin is that of a woman from the tribe of &ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; the tribe of a viper biting the horse&rsquo;s heels and causing the rider to fall backward from God&rsquo;s economy.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS FATHER BEING A TYRIAN</h2>
<p>Hiram&rsquo;s father was a Tyrian, a man of Tyre (1 Kings 7:14). According to Ezekiel 28, Tyre was a place filled with commerce (Ezek. 28:16). Tyre was a commercial center, a place of international trade, like today&rsquo;s Hong Kong. Because Tyre was filled with merchandise, she was one with Satan (v. 12). Ezekiel 28 reveals that the king of Tyre was one with Satan and even the very embodiment of Satan. Where commerce is, there Satan is also, for Satan is in commerce. If you would see Satan today, go to the commercial city of Hong Kong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MARRIAGE OF HIS PARENTS BEING AGAINST<br />
GOD&rsquo;S HOLY REGULATION</h2>
<p>The marriage of Hiram&rsquo;s parents was against God&rsquo;s holy regulation (Deut. 7:3). A woman of the tribe of the serpent married a man from the country of Satan. What a combination! This woman of the tribe of the serpent married a man from the country of Tyre because of riches, commerce.</p>
<p>Not only in Hiram&rsquo;s day but today also you need skill to make money. For this reason there are many technical colleges in the United States. These technical schools teach skills, techniques, and trades that enable people to earn money. The only goal of colleges and universities is to train people to be moneymakers.</p>
<p>I would encourage you all to learn how to make money. I have encouraged my grandchildren to study medicine. Although some saints have tried to discourage them from studying medicine, telling them that they only need to read the Bible and love the Lord, I have said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to this talk. Those who say this don&rsquo;t know life. You must listen to your grandfather. He knows life better than you all. Go to study medicine.&rdquo; One of my grandsons took my word and earned all A&rsquo;s in his first year of pre-medical studies. Do not think that this is a kind of love for the world. As you shall see, I have a definite purpose in doing this. Hiram became the builder of the pillars. But if his father had not been a Tyrian, he would not have had the skill to fashion the pillars. We all were born of a &ldquo;Danite&rdquo; mother and we all need a &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father. The more of a &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; our father is, the better. If you think that I am too extreme in saying this, I would ask you to read this message to the end.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING ONE<br />
OF THE TRIBE OF NAPHTALI</h2>
<p>According to the Hebrew text of 1 Kings 7:14, we are also told that Hiram was of the tribe of Naphtali. Although his mother was a Danite and his father a Tyrian, Hiram eventually became one belonging to the tribe of Naphtali.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Hind Set Free</h2>
<p>In Genesis 49:21 Jacob said, &ldquo;Naphtali is a hind let loose; / He gives beautiful words.&rdquo; Here Jacob spoke of Naphtali with high favor. A hind does not seem to be related to beautiful words. But we must not understand the Bible according to our natural mind; we must understand the Bible according to the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Trusting and Rejoicing in God</h2>
<p>A hind signifies a person who trusts in God in a desperate situation. Habakkuk 3:17 and 18 say, &ldquo;For the fig tree will not sprout, / And there will be no yield on the vines; / The labor on the olive tree will fail, / And the fields will make no food; / The flock will be cut off from the fold, / And there will be no herd in the stalls. / Yet I will exult in Jehovah; / I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.&rdquo; Those who trust in God and rejoice in God in the midst of a desperate situation, a situation in which every source of supply is cut off, are hinds.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Walking upon High Places</h2>
<p>Habakkuk 3:19 says, &ldquo;Jehovah the Lord is my strength; / And he makes my feet like hinds&rsquo; feet / And will cause me to walk on my high places.&rdquo; Those who trust in God walk, not in the valleys but upon the tops of the mountains. If you do not know how to exercise faith in God when you are in a desperate situation, at that time you will creep in the valleys. You will never walk and skip upon the mountains. Only those who trust in God when they are in a desperate situation can leap upon the mountaintops. People may say, &ldquo;Look! The fig tree does not blossom, the vine does not bear fruit, the olive labors in vain, the fields yield no food, the flocks are cut off in the fold, and there is no herd in the stalls. Oh, the situation is desperate, and we are finished!&rdquo; When you hear this, you should say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Now is the time for me to trust in Him.&rdquo; If you are like this, you will not be discouraged. Rather, you will leap and skip like a hind upon the mountaintops.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Living in Resurrection</h2>
<p>The hind is also mentioned in the title of Psalm 22, which says, &ldquo;According to the hind of the dawn.&rdquo; This psalm is about Christ in resurrection through crucifixion. The first verse was uttered by the Lord Jesus on the cross: &ldquo;My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?&rdquo; However, verse 22 says, &ldquo;I will declare Your name to my brothers; / In the midst of the assembly I will praise You.&rdquo; This verse is quoted in Hebrews 2:12, which relates the resurrected Christ to the church. Hence, Psalm 22, sung to the tune of the hind of the dawn, is on Christ in resurrection for the church. In the Old Testament the hind refers not only to a person who trusts in God and walks upon the mountaintops, but also to one who lives in resurrection for God&rsquo;s assembly, for the church life.</p>
<p>Are you a &ldquo;hind,&rdquo; or are you a &ldquo;turtle&rdquo;? I never saw a turtle skipping upon the mountaintops. Turtles are found in low places near water. Those who trust in God are not &ldquo;turtles&rdquo; but &ldquo;hinds.&rdquo; They are in resurrection for God&rsquo;s assembly, the church. Only by regeneration and transformation can we be this kind of person. Naphtali is the tribe of the hind, and a hind signifies a regenerated and transformed person, a person who trusts in God, walks on the mountaintops, and lives in resurrection for the church life. How wonderful!</p>
<h2 class="head2">Giving Beautiful Words</h2>
<p>Naphtali also gives beautiful words. Naphtali was in the land of Galilee (Matt. 4:15). All the first group of apostles came from Galilee, and in Acts 1:11 they were addressed as &ldquo;Men of Galilee.&rdquo; Out from these Galileans, people of Naphtali, came beautiful words, that is, the preaching of the gospel. In the New Testament we see that the word which came out of these Galileans was the word of life (Acts 5:20), the word of grace (14:3), the word of salvation (13:26), the word of wisdom (1 Cor. 12:8), the word of knowledge (v. 8), and the word of building (Acts 20:32).</p><h2 class="head1">HIS TYRIAN FATHER DYING<br />
AND HIS DANITE MOTHER<br />
BECOMING WIDOWED</h2>
<p>The apostle Paul was truly a Hiram. I do not know who Paul&rsquo;s mother was, but, spiritually speaking, I am certain that she was a &ldquo;daughter of Dan,&rdquo; a daughter of the tribe of the serpent. Undoubtedly, in principle, Paul&rsquo;s father was a &ldquo;Tyrian.&rdquo; Paul was brought up &ldquo;at the feet of Gamaliel&rdquo; (Acts 22:3), a doctor of the law. At that time, law was the highest science among the Jews, and whoever became a doctor of law was considered to be most outstanding. Gamaliel taught Paul everything regarding the religion of their forefathers. Paul&rsquo;s studying under Gamaliel was equivalent to studying in a seminary today. Although a seminary does not teach a trade and thus is different from a technical college, the principle of both a seminary and a technical college is the same in teaching knowledge.</p>
<p>Consider also the example of Moses. Moses was born of a Jewish mother, but he was brought up in the royal family in Egypt. Acts 7:22 says, &ldquo;Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and works.&rdquo; He was a scholar in Egypt. Paul was a scholar of religious knowledge, and Moses was a scholar of secular knowledge. However, again the principle was the same. Eventually, both Moses and Paul became pillar builders. In 1 Corinthians 3:10 Paul said that he was &ldquo;a wise master builder.&rdquo; Both Moses and Paul had a &ldquo;Danite&rdquo; mother and a &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father. The royal Egyptian family was Moses&rsquo; &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father, for it was there that he learned all the wisdom of Egypt. This was the source of his Egyptian skill. The teaching of Gamaliel was the source of Paul&rsquo;s knowledge. In this way, Gamaliel became Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father.</p>
<p>Now we must see a crucial point: All the &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; fathers must die. Hiram learned his trade from his Tyrian father, but eventually this Tyrian father died. As far as Moses was concerned, the royal family of Egypt died and was cut off. After Moses had learned everything of the Egyptians, that Egyptian source was terminated. Likewise, after Paul had learned everything from Gamaliel, the source of Gamaliel was cut off. In like manner, we all must be sons of a widow. Our father must die, but our mother may remain as a widow. Our Egyptian father or our Gamaliel must die, leaving us as the sons of a widowed mother. This means that the source of our secular or religious skill must die, but that the source of our human being must still exist. Today, we all must have a deceased father and a widowed mother.</p>
<p>In Moses&rsquo; time, no one could have understood God&rsquo;s plan for the tabernacle like he could, because no one else had gained all the wisdom of the Egyptians. Moses acquired the wisdom of the Egyptians before he was forty years of age. After gaining it, he thought that he was qualified to deliver his people out of the hands of the Egyptians (Acts 7:23-25), but he failed in this endeavor. After Moses fled from Egypt, he lived in the wilderness for forty years. By the time he was eighty years of age, he considered himself to be a dead man. In his psalm, Psalm 90, Moses said that people may expect to live to be seventy, and that the stronger ones may live to be eighty (v. 10). When Moses was eighty years old, he might have said to himself, &ldquo;I am finished. What can I do? Forty years ago I could have done something, but I cannot do anything today. I am not yet dead, but I am dying.&rdquo; As Moses was dying there in the wilderness, he one day saw the burning bush (Exo. 3:2). Although the bush was burning, it was not consumed. In the vision of the burning bush God seemed to be telling Moses, &ldquo;Moses, I will make you burning, but I will not burn you. I don&rsquo;t need you to be the fuel. When you were forty years of age, you had a great deal of fuel, but now you are old, dried up, and have no more fuel. I have come to make you burning.&rdquo; At the time of this vision, Moses&rsquo; &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father had finally died. Later, as Moses led the children of Israel in the wilderness, what he had learned in the royal palace became useful. Because no one else had all the wisdom of the Egyptians, no one else could have done the work he did in the wilderness.</p>
<p>The principle is the same with a brother who has gained a great deal of Bible knowledge in the past. This knowledge of the Bible is his &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father. But this &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father must die. The source of his Bible knowledge must be terminated. Then whatever he has learned in the past will become useful in resurrection, and he will be able to deliver a word as few others are able to do. Just as the wisdom of the Egyptians became useful in the resurrected Moses, so whatever we learn in college, seminary, or Bible school will become useful in resurrection. However, if our &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father still lives and we remain in the natural life, the &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; skill will be of no avail to the building up of God&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>I encourage all the young people to get a college degree. Do not make spirituality an excuse for not studying. Rather, study more diligently than the secular students, get the highest grades, and go on for advanced degrees. Do not stop with one Ph.D., but get two or three Ph.D.&rsquo;s. Also learn to speak a number of other languages. Gain the &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; skills and the &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo; knowledge. Become a doctor in biology, medicine, or nuclear physics. But then let the &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father die. I have told you how I encouraged my grandson to study medicine. Now I will tell you what is truly on my heart. After he finishes medical school, I will say, &ldquo;Forget about being a doctor and use your medical training to interpret the Bible.&rdquo; His medical training will make him very useful. Young people, gain all the up-to-date knowledge, graduate from college, and then say goodbye to your &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father. Graduate from seminary and then say, &ldquo;Seminary, thank you and goodbye. I have nothing more to do with you, but I will use the skill I have gained from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young people, you all must study. Do not use the three weekly life-study messages as an excuse. You must both study earnestly and read the life-study messages. Otherwise, I would have no trust in you because the Lord would put no trust in you. You must acquire the &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; knowledge and graduate from the &ldquo;University of Tyre.&rdquo; But after you gain your &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; education, you must put your &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father in a coffin and bury him, so that your &ldquo;Danite&rdquo; mother becomes a widow. Then you will be of the tribe of Naphtali, useful in resurrection for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Some may ask me about the apostles Peter and John, pointing out that they had no higher education and that in Acts 4:13 they were described as &ldquo;uneducated men and laymen.&rdquo; This, of course, is true. But who was the leading pillar builder in the New Testament? Undoubtedly, it was Paul. Peter wrote just two Epistles, but Paul wrote fourteen Epistles. Peter even recognized his shortage by recommending Paul&rsquo;s writings, saying, &ldquo;Our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you&rdquo; (2 Pet. 3:15). Peter even confessed that some of Paul&rsquo;s writings were difficult to understand (v. 16). Peter seemed to be saying, &ldquo;You must read Paul&rsquo;s writings to learn something deeper than I can give you.&rdquo; We need Peters today, but we also need Pauls, those who can write more epistles. Some may still say, &ldquo;How about the apostle John? Didn&rsquo;t he write a Gospel containing twenty-one chapters and the book of Revelation containing twenty-two chapters?&rdquo; John&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; education only enabled him to do this much; he could not do what Paul was able to do. John could say, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God.&rdquo; John could tell people that if they believed in Him, they would have life, but that if they did not believe in Him, they would die. But John was not able to write Romans chapters four or seven or the book of Ephesians. If John had been asked to do this, he might have said, &ldquo;I am not able to do it. Go to Brother Paul.&rdquo; John was qualified to see the vision of the great harlot and of the New Jerusalem, but he was not the one to write books like Romans, Ephesians, and Hebrews.</p>
<p>There is a need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today for those with the highest education. Young people, you must endeavor to gain the best education. Arrange your daily schedule in this way: seven and a half hours for sleep, one and a half hours for eating, one hour for exercise, eight hours for study, and six hours for spiritual things. If you expend your energy in this way, by the time you are thirty you will be able to begin your ministry like the Lord Jesus did (Luke 3:23). Continue your studies until you are thirty. If many take this way, we shall have no shortage of pillar makers.</p>
<p>Do not get married too soon. I do not like to see the brothers getting married before the age of twenty-five. Do not be burdened down too soon with marriage and children. Rather, use your time and energy for studying. The age of twenty-six is soon enough for brothers to begin having children. Furthermore, I do not like to see the sisters getting married before the age of twenty-two. If the sisters marry too early and have children too soon, they may be overburdened and even spoiled. Follow the schedule I recommend until you are twenty-five years old and see what will be the issue. This surely is good for God&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Are you anxious to be a Hiram? If you are, then you must be related to your &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father, learn the &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; skill and trade, and gain the wisdom of the &ldquo;Egyptians.&rdquo; Do not stop your schooling too soon. You should get a master&rsquo;s degree, or preferably a Ph.D. All the church people must be learned ones. We are neither ignorant nor undereducated. Rather, we would have the highest education. We would acquire all the wisdom of the &ldquo;Egyptians,&rdquo; but we would not work for the &ldquo;Egyptians&rdquo;&#151; we would work for the holy tabernacle. We should be able to say, &ldquo;I know medicine and nuclear science, but I am not working for that. I am working for the building up of the church. I have learned a trade, but I am not occupied with this. I am building the pillars for the temple of my God.&rdquo; For this, our &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father must die, our &ldquo;Danite&rdquo; mother must be widowed, and we must belong to the tribe of &ldquo;Naphtali,&rdquo; the tribe of transformation. Be a person full of learning, but do not use your learning for secular business. Use it fully for the Lord&rsquo;s building work. Your life and your being must not only be transformed but also transferred. You must no longer be of &ldquo;Dan&rdquo; or of &ldquo;Tyre,&rdquo; but absolutely of &ldquo;Naphtali.&rdquo; As hinds that have been freed, we would trust in God, walk upon the mountaintops, and live in resurrection for the church life, giving forth words of life, grace, salvation, wisdom, knowledge, and building. If we are like this, then we shall be builders of pillars.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>
<p>It is not easy to know the Bible. Sometimes when translators have difficulty with a particular passage, they assume that the manuscripts are in error. However, when we probe into the depths of the revelation of the Bible, we must worship God. Often what at first glance appears to be a mistake in the manuscripts turns out to be a mysterious truth hidden in the Scriptures. This is true with respect to 1 Kings 7:14. The King James Version renders the verse as, &ldquo;He [Hiram] was a widow&rsquo;s son of the tribe of Naphtali.&rdquo; According to this rendering and the understanding of most translators, the modifier <em>of the tribe of Naphtali</em> goes with the word <em>widow.</em> This would mean that this verse says that the widow was of the tribe of Naphtali. But 2 Chronicles 2:14 says that Hiram was &ldquo;the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan.&rdquo; How could a daughter of Dan also be of the tribe of Naphtali? Some translators, neglecting the Hebrew text of 1 Kings 7:14, tried their best to reconcile this discrepancy, but they failed. By studying the Hebrew text we have learned that this verse should be translated as follows: &ldquo;The son of a widowed woman; and he was of the tribe of Naphtali.&rdquo; Thus, Hiram, the son, was of the tribe of Naphtali. This solves the problem.</p>
<p>In this record of Hiram, the pillar builder, we have three peoples: the people of Dan, the people of Tyre, and the people of Naphtali. Hiram&rsquo;s mother was of Dan, his father was of Tyre, and he himself became one of the tribe of Naphtali. We do not know how a man whose mother was of Dan and whose father was of Tyre could be of the tribe of Naphtali. We only know that the Bible tells us so.</p><h2 class="head1">HIRAM&rsquo;S TRANSFER<br />
TO THE TRIBE OF NAPHTALI<br />
BEING MYSTERIOUS</h2>
<p>The Bible is profound, and many things revealed in it are mysterious. Although there seems to be no reason for Hiram to be of the tribe of Naphtali, the Bible clearly tells that he was of this tribe. If we consider the significance of Dan, Tyre, and Naphtali, we shall worship God. Dan was a people of the serpent that bit the horse in the race of God (Gen. 49:17), and Tyre, a center filled with commerce, was related to Satan (Ezek. 28:12, 16). How marvelous that a man born of a woman of the people of the serpent and of a man of the people related to Satan could eventually become one of the tribe of Naphtali.</p>
<p>Naphtali is a hind (Gen. 49:21), which is useful to God. The description of the hind in the Old Testament record is very significant. According to the Bible, a hind signifies a person who trusts in God when he is in a desperate situation. Due to this trust, the Lord causes him to walk, even to skip, upon the high places (Hab. 3:17-19). The title of Psalm 22 reveals that the hind also signifies the very Christ who, having passed through the suffering of crucifixion, has entered into resurrection for the sake of the church. Hebrews 2:11 and 12 reveal that the resurrected Christ is for the church. Therefore, the hind signifies a person who trusts in God, who walks upon the mountaintops, and who lives by the resurrected Christ for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Which do you prefer to be&#151;a serpent, a &ldquo;Tyrian,&rdquo; or a hind? I certainly prefer to be one of the tribe of Naphtali, trusting in God, walking upon the high places, and living in the resurrected Christ for God&rsquo;s building. Hiram was such a person.</p>
<p>When some read this, they may think that it is merely allegorization or inference. It is not wrong to make inferences. If we see the letters b-o-y, we may rightly infer that they spell the word <em>boy.</em> This inference is not only correct, but also necessary. In order to make inferences related to what is found in the Bible, we must firstly know the Bible. Many who do not know the significance of the tribe of Dan or of the country of Tyre would say, &ldquo;Dan is Dan and Tyre is Tyre. We don&rsquo;t care for all these things.&rdquo; Genesis 49:21 says, &ldquo;Naphtali is a hind let loose; / He gives beautiful words.&rdquo; Perhaps you have never paid attention to this verse. Naphtali is a hind that is released and freed. This hind knows no bondage and is not held in any fold; rather, it is freed to skip on the mountaintops. We must be such persons, persons who are freed from every bondage and man-made fold.</p>
<p>Now we must ask how a man born of a Danite mother and a Tyrian father could become one of the tribe of Naphtali. It is mysterious. A portion of the personal history of every Christian should be mysterious. Every Christian has a mysterious history. When I was young, I enjoyed playing soccer. I could play soccer all day long. But when I went to play again after I was saved, a strange thing happened. As I waited for the ball to come my way, I found that my feet would not move. When the ball did come to me, I simply could not play. Formerly, I was the fastest one in running and carrying the ball, but now I could not move and I eventually withdrew from the game. Others were shocked, and some said, &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;It is difficult for me to say.&rdquo; This is mysterious. Have you not had mysterious experiences like this? If not, then I doubt that you are my brother or sister in the Lord. Although I was a natural born soccer player, I suddenly became another person. For about fifty-five years I have not returned to play soccer.</p>
<p>There is a mysterious element in our regenerated life. Yes, we were born of a &ldquo;Danite&rdquo; mother and of a &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father, but we have been regenerated to be another person. Even the young ones among us can testify that certain mysterious things have happened to them. Part of their human history is mysterious. The more you take this way, the more mysterious you will become. My wife has to admit that many times she cannot understand me. On occasion, something causes anger to rise up in me, but a few minutes later I begin to say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Praise the Lord! Amen!&rdquo; Although my wife exercises her ability to understand what is going on within me, she simply cannot fathom what happens to me. Because this is so mysterious, I can only say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord!&rdquo; How mysterious this is!</p>
<p>Both Dan and Tyre are visible, but Naphtali is invisible. People could see that I was born of my natural mother and father, but they could not see how I became such a mysterious person. Every spiritual &ldquo;Naphtalite&rdquo; is invisible and mysterious. People should not be entirely able to understand you. If your classmates in school can understand everything about you, you are finished. You are not a wonderful Christian, for a wonderful Christian should not be that understandable. Instead, you should be a puzzle to your classmates or those with whom you work. You must also be a mysterious person in your married life. Although your dear wife may be a good sister, you should be somewhat mysterious in her eyes. If you are not mysterious, I do not believe that you are a good brother. The sisters should likewise be somewhat mysterious to their husbands. Before the Lord, I can testify that I do not understand certain things about my wife. She should not be able to bear so much, but due to the mysterious life within her she is able to bear much more than I think. We Christians have a mysterious source and origin. We even have a mysterious Originator within us.</p>
<p>It is a secret to us how Hiram became one of the tribe of Naphtali. We must bow our heads and worship God for this mysterious element concealed in Hiram&rsquo;s history. How marvelous that his history not only records that his mother was of the tribe of the serpent and that his father was of the nation of commerce, a country related to Satan, but that he became one of the tribe of Naphtali. Hence, his history implies a mysterious part of his life that was used by God for His building. Although in the Bible the reason for this point is not mentioned, according to our experience we can understand that this is the mysterious part of our Christian life. The greater this mysterious portion is, the better, because it is this part that made Hiram one of the tribe of Naphtali and that made him the builder of pillars. Likewise, it is this mysterious part that makes us good for God&rsquo;s building. We should not live as one born of &ldquo;Dan&rdquo; or of &ldquo;Tyre.&rdquo; Rather, we must live as one who has been transferred into the tribe of Naphtali. Hallelujah! Today, I am not of &ldquo;Dan&rdquo; or of &ldquo;Tyre&rdquo;&#151;I am of the tribe of &ldquo;Naphtali.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE TYRIAN FATHER,<br />
THE SOURCE OF SECULAR SKILL, HAVING TO DIE</h2>
<p>The Tyrian father, the source of secular skill, had to die that the son who learned this skill through the worldly father may be released from the worldly tie. Hiram&rsquo;s Tyrian father died. What a difference there would have been if his mother had died instead of his father! If that had been the case, this record would not match our experience, and it would be impossible to allegorize this portion of the Word. Praise the Lord that our &ldquo;father,&rdquo; not our &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; has died. This means that the source of secular skill has been cut off by God. The father signifies the source of skill, and the mother signifies human existence. If our &ldquo;mother&rdquo; died and our &ldquo;father&rdquo; lived, we would be &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; fully involved with the world. We must go on existing as humans. Even Paul says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). The old man, the old &ldquo;father,&rdquo; has been crucified; yet we still exist. That &ldquo;I&rdquo; who continues to exist is the &ldquo;mother&rdquo; of our human existence.</p>
<p>Moses is a good example. He was raised in the royal Egyptian family where he learned all the wisdom of the Egyptians. At the age of forty, he considered himself qualified to deliver his people from the usurping hand of the Egyptians. However, he failed because his &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father, his connection with Egypt, still remained. This indicated that the source of his skill had not been cut off. The Lord intervened to break that connection, and Moses fled to the wilderness. Although Moses&rsquo; &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father, the royal Egyptian family, died, he himself continued to exist. The widowed &ldquo;mother&rdquo; remained. Although she continued to live, she was no longer tied to her husband.</p>
<p>Let us now apply this to our own experience. You may earn a Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But after you earn this degree, Massachusetts Institute of Technology must die. This does not mean that you must die. You must continue to exist, but your existence must be widowed, separated from the worldly source. You continue to possess your skill, but the origin and source of that skill has been cut off. Your continued existence is the &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; and the source of your skill, which has been cut off, is your deceased &ldquo;father.&rdquo; Now you possess the skill without the source, and your human existence is no longer tied to your worldly origin.</p>
<p>Many of the young brothers and sisters are unbalanced and say, &ldquo;We are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and we are expecting the Lord to come back soon. He may come back in two years. Why then should we worry about finishing high school and preparing ourselves for college? We should spend our time to pray-read and to fellowship with other brothers and sisters. Since the Lord is coming soon, why should we waste our time reading and studying?&rdquo; If this is your attitude, the Lord may delay His coming back until you have learned to study. Actually, you should not just aim to finish high school, but also to graduate from college, and even to earn a Ph.D. I know what is on the heart of the young people. Many sisters think that it is sufficient to graduate from high school or, at most, junior college. They may say, &ldquo;We sisters will not be elders. Why should we waste our time in school? Isn&rsquo;t it good enough to learn to type and make six hundred dollars a month? Let us enjoy an easy Christian life and a happy church life.&rdquo; Sisters, you must abandon this concept. No matter how much you love the Lord, if you hold this concept, you will never be very useful to Him. No time spent in studying is wasted. As young people, you must use your time to study. Although the Lord may come back in a few years, you must still study and learn the &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; skill. If you are under the age of twenty-three, your time must be devoted to your education. You should finish your university course by the age of twenty-two or twenty-three. This is not a regulation of the church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery; this is my teaching. From now on, when young brothers and sisters come to me, I shall ask them what year they have finished in school. If anyone aged twenty-two would say that he has not yet graduated from high school, I would not waste my time in talking to him. Such a person, four years behind in school, might be retarded and would be unable to understand my fellowship concerning the Bible. But if a brother would tell me that he has just finished his first year of graduate school, I would be happy to talk with him concerning the depths of the Bible.</p>
<p>Although you should do your best to earn an advanced degree, after you have earned it, you must be prepared to sever the worldly ties. Do not burn your diploma (you will need that for business purposes), but say within yourself, &ldquo;My &lsquo;Tyrian&rsquo; father has died. The day of my graduation will be the day of his funeral.&rdquo; After you have labored for years to earn your degree, you must put your &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father in a coffin and bury him. Never boast that you have graduated from a university. After Moses left the royal Egyptian family, he never mentioned it again. That family was buried. But many Christians with earned doctorates always like to put the title &ldquo;Dr.&rdquo; in front of their names. Fifty or sixty years ago, people liked to say that they had graduated from Oxford or Cambridge. Although some boast of their education, after we have earned our degrees, we must bury Cambridge, Oxford, and every other university. The father of our &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; skill must die and be buried. The skill is useful, but the father has a foul odor.</p>
<p>As you read this, you may say that you do not understand what I am talking about. This is mysterious, and there is no need to understand it. The best Christians are those who study diligently and who afterwards seem to forget that they have earned a degree. Their unbelieving relatives and friends will not understand this. To them, it is mysterious that we would devote so much time and labor to earn a degree and then not respect it. Praise the Lord that they do not understand us! This is another aspect of our Christian mystery. We Christians have many mysterious aspects. For example, I know of some Christians who freely spend money on others, but not on themselves. Their relatives do not understand why they are so strict with themselves and so generous with others. We Christians must be people with a mysterious history. How mysterious of us to earn a degree and then to cut off our &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father!</p>
<p>If this father does not die, he will bind us to the world, and our education will become the strongest tie. In my ministry throughout the years I have learned that no highly educated person can understand the Bible unless he cuts off this worldly tie. Being proud of your education will hinder you from knowing the Scriptures. No matter how educated you are, you must humbly tell the Lord that you are a teachable little child and that in your whole being you are utterly empty. You should be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, although I have three Ph.D.&rsquo;s, I know nothing. I am not filled up by my education. I am empty in my spirit, in my mind, and in my whole being.&rdquo; Many highly educated professional people are filled to the brim. For this reason, even after they are saved, they are unable to receive anything from the Word. Their pride has usurped them. We need to cut the tie with our &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father and become like a child who knows nothing. Although we have knowledge, we would not be proud or filled with knowledge; instead, we would be empty. If we are like this, we shall be able to understand the Bible.</p>
<p>We need some brothers and sisters with doctor&rsquo;s degrees. It would be very beneficial to have some with Ph.D.&rsquo;s in biblical Hebrew and Greek. It would also be helpful for some to earn Ph.D.&rsquo;s in space science and nuclear physics. The church should not be poor or on a low level. Rather, it should have the highest people on earth. Young people, this must become your burden.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DANITE MOTHER,<br />
SIGNIFYING HUMAN EXISTENCE,<br />
REMAINING AS A WIDOW</h2>
<p>Although the &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father must die, the &ldquo;Danite&rdquo; mother, our human existence, must remain as a widow. Young people, if you take this word, after a number of years you will be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You for that word about the &lsquo;Tyrian&rsquo; father and &lsquo;Danite&rsquo; mother. I have earned a doctor&rsquo;s degree, and the father of this degree has died, but the &lsquo;Danite&rsquo; mother still lives. As the son of this widowed mother, I still possess my skills.&rdquo; If you are like this, you will certainly be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Although we believe that the Lord is coming soon, we should still expect to have a long life on the earth for the Lord&rsquo;s use. In my early ministry I repeatedly prayed Solomon&rsquo;s prayer for wisdom in coming in and going out among God&rsquo;s people (1 Kings 3:7, 9). I can testify that the Lord has answered my prayer, helping me learn how to behave in the house of God and how to come in and go out among the saints. In addition, I have often prayed that the Lord would give me long life. I do not want to learn the things of God and then die shortly afterwards. Rather, I want to live a long life so that everything I have learned may be useful. All the young people should have this attitude and say, &ldquo;Lord, I know You are coming soon. But I don&rsquo;t want to see You in resurrection&#151;I want to see You in rapture. I want to live a long life until You come, not that I might have enjoyment, but that I might be useful for Your purpose on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When my mother died in 1945, I wept. Although I have undergone many sufferings in the thirty-two years since then, I have hardly wept at all in these years. However, when in 1972 the news came to me that Brother Nee had died, I wept. I wept because I knew him intimately, had spent many years with him, and had received great help from him for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Year after year, he saw new things and had new experiences. Nearly everything he learned he passed on to me. From 1952 until he went to the Lord in 1972, he was in prison. I am sure that during those twenty years he learned many things, but not one word came out. This was the real reason I wept. How different the situation would be today if Brother Nee were still alive among us. Although I thank the Lord for those who are bearing the ark with me, I nevertheless constantly have a deep feeling of loneliness. If Brother Nee and my other senior co-workers were still living, I would not have this feeling. When I was with them on mainland China, I had some more experienced ones with whom I could have fellowship. I could refer matters to them, and they would always render me the help I needed. But when I refer matters to the brothers today, I feel that I am alone. I hope that in the coming years all of you will have many others with you on your level.</p>
<p>That the &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father must die and our mother must keep on living means that we should ask the Lord to give us a long life. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, I don&rsquo;t want to die early. I want to live to be eighty or ninety. If You do not come then, I am willing to die. But I still prefer to live until You come.&rdquo; We all, especially the young people, should pray like this.</p>
<p>The Lord has been merciful in answering my prayers for long life. But do not think that I have never had any diseases or illnesses. I have had a stomach ulcer, and it took me two and one half years to recover from a serious case of tuberculosis of the lungs. In order for our human existence to remain, we must stand against any weakness. Tell the Lord that you do not want to have a weak, unhealthy body. Do not think a spiritual person must be physically weak. Do not hold the concept that only by being physically weak can you learn to trust in the Lord. This concept is too spiritual. If you are too spiritual, you are not truly spiritual at all. Rather, you should say, &ldquo;Lord, I don&rsquo;t agree with having an unhealthy body. Grant me a good appetite, the proper digestion, and the best sleep. Lord, promise me, as You have promised others, that my strength would be as my days. Every day must be filled with strength. I don&rsquo;t want to spend one day lying idly in bed. I refuse that kind of existence. I want to have a strong, healthy existence that is useful for Your purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to praying in this manner, you must also learn to take proper care of your body. Do not be unwise in your eating. The Lord has given me a good wife who exercises control over my eating. If it were not for her, I would take every opportunity to eat dessert. But because of her concern for my diet, I am healthy today. Daily I eat the most healthy foods. Do not commit gradual suicide over a period of years by eating unwisely, but learn to keep yourself healthy. Take care of your body that your widowed &ldquo;Danite&rdquo; mother may go on living. Our purpose in this is not our health, but our being useful to the Lord.</p>
<p>In spite of the opposition, rumors, and criticisms, the Lord is opening doors throughout the country. He has given us an open door that no one is able to shut. But we are short of pillars. Recently, we have heard testimonies of what the Lord is doing in various places. However, we do not have the pillars to match the Lord&rsquo;s move. Doors are also opening in Europe, but there are not enough pillars. We must admit that we are short of pillars. This lack is due to the past situation. But, beginning now, we must cut off our past and go on. The young people must arise and tell the whole universe that the past situation is over. Young people, speak to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;We young people have no history. We all will rise up. Lord, be merciful to us and do everything You can in the next several years to make us all pillars.&rdquo; This is my burden. I long to see that after some years many young ones will be ready to be sent out. If we had two strong pillars to go to one of the new places, within a few months three other localities would open up. The open doors always multiply like this. We go to one place, and our going there opens up other places. It all depends upon the pillars.</p>
<p>Most of the older ones among us have wasted many years. All the years spent sitting in Christianity have been wasted. Year after year went by, but everything remained the same. Our young people must not be like this. Even one month must make a difference. Nevertheless, the older brothers and sisters should not be disappointed. It is not too late for them to go on. There is a great need for those who can shepherd others. We all must endeavor to become useful.</p>
<p>I am certain that the way we are now taking is absolutely right. Do not consider any other way&#151;dive into this flow and stay in it. Use this opportunity to learn, to be trained, to be adjusted, to be saturated by the Lord, and to be made useful for Him. We all must learn this way and never return to the old way.</p>
<p>I hate the old way. According to the old way, many go to the meetings clinging to their opinions and thinking that they are so experienced. When the brothers minister the Word, they &ldquo;discern&rdquo; the message (actually they are being critical), wanting to determine whether or not the brothers are scriptural. It is not your responsibility to discern the brothers. Let the Lord take care of that. Instead, you must learn your own lessons and have all the dealings necessary to make you useful. We all should hold this attitude. Do not think that you are too old to be useful. Everyone who wants to be useful can become useful.</p>
<p>This is not a doctrine; it is my practical fellowship with you all, especially with the young ones. Young people, I hope that your whole being will be open so that you may make a clear decision and say, &ldquo;Lord, this is it. From now on, I will do everything possible to learn all I need to learn. Lord, I ask You to help me in this matter. After I graduate, my &lsquo;Tyrian&rsquo; father must die, but my &lsquo;Danite&rsquo; mother must continue to exist. Lord, grant me this kind of living that I may be useful to You.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECULAR SKILL<br />
BEING USEFUL FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING ONLY IN RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The secular skills we gain will only be useful for God&rsquo;s building in resurrection, that is, after the worldly father has died and we, the &ldquo;learned son,&rdquo; have been transferred into the tribe of Naphtali. After your &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father has died and your &ldquo;Danite&rdquo; mother has become widowed, you must not remain a natural person. Anything natural is a waste. Instead of being natural, we must exercise ourselves to be in resurrection in every aspect of our living. This is a great matter. The more you exercise yourself to be in resurrection, the more useful you will be. You must be in resurrection even in your relationship with your wife. All the skills we acquire must be in resurrection.</p>
<p>Years ago, I often wrote a letter two or three times because after the first writing I felt that some phrases were too natural and were not in resurrection. Hence, I destroyed the letter and began again. After exercising like this to write a letter, I would still wait a day before mailing it. My purpose in doing so was to determine whether or not that letter was truly in resurrection. We all must learn to do things and to have our being in resurrection. This is a basic matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRANSFERRED NAPHTALITE NEEDING TO COME TO KING SOLOMON IN JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>Hiram was fetched out of Tyre and was brought to King Solomon in Jerusalem. This means that the transferred Naphtalite must be fetched out of Tyre and come to King Solomon in Jerusalem where God&rsquo;s building is (1 Kings 7:13-14). King Solomon was a type of Christ, and Jerusalem, the place where God&rsquo;s building was, signifies the church. Today&rsquo;s Solomon and God&rsquo;s present building are both in the church. In a very good sense, the church today is Jerusalem. Although your &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father has died, your widowed &ldquo;Danite&rdquo; mother continues to exist, and you are in resurrection, you still need to come to the church because this is where God&rsquo;s building is. God will not build His temple in Tyre. Although you may be very useful, if you remain in Tyre, you will be useless as far as God&rsquo;s building is concerned. If you remain in Tyre, you may be qualified, but your standing, your ground, will be wrong. The Lord must fetch you out of Tyre and bring you to Jerusalem. If your &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; father dies, your &ldquo;Danite&rdquo; mother goes on living as a widow, and you are in resurrection and have come to Jerusalem, then you will be useful for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CASES OF MOSES WITH JOSHUA AND PAUL WITH TIMOTHY</h2>
<p>You are probably familiar with the cases of Moses with Joshua (Num. 27:15-23) and of Paul with Timothy (1 Tim. 1:1-3; 2 Tim. 1:1-2, 6-8; 2:1-3). Moses and Paul firstly became pillars themselves and later became pillar builders. Moses built Joshua and Paul built Timothy. Moses did not actually bring the children of Israel into the rest; Joshua, who was a pillar built up by Moses, did this. Likewise, Paul built up Timothy, and Timothy became a pillar standing to bear the church testimony. In the cases of both Moses and Paul we see that their &ldquo;Tyrian&rdquo; fathers died. In Philippians 3, Paul, speaking of his religious background, said, &ldquo;What things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ.&rdquo; Paul had learned a great deal at the feet of Gamaliel (Acts 22:3), but Gamaliel, the source of Paul&rsquo;s skill, had to be cut off. However, Paul&rsquo;s human existence remained. Furthermore, both Moses and Paul were in resurrection. They were also fetched out of &ldquo;Tyre&rdquo; and brought to the place where God&rsquo;s building was. With Moses this building was the tabernacle, and with Paul it was the church. History records that Moses and Paul were more than useful in the hands of God. They were not only pillars; they were also pillar builders. This is the need in the church today. In order for this need to be met, we all must pray to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, for the sake of Your building, make me a pillar and a pillar builder.&rdquo;</p></body></html>
