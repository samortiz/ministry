<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST AS THE GREAT HIGH PRIEST SUPERIOR TO AARON</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 4:14-16; 7:16, 25</h1><p>The third section of the book of Hebrews, from 4:14 to 7:28, is a comparison between Christ and the high priest in Judaism. As we pointed out before, in Judaism there are God, the angels, Moses who was sent as an apostle by God and from God, the high priests such as Aaron with his sons, and the old covenant. These five items together comprise Judaism. The book of Hebrews is a comparison of Christ with Judaism. It tells us that Christ Himself is the very God, the Son of God; He is the effulgence of God’s glory and the impress of His substance. He is even called God Himself (1:8). In Him there is the reality of God. As such, He is much superior to the angels. He is also a glorified man with God’s divine nature, crowned with glory and honor. As such a man, He is superior to the angels. The angels are merely servants of those who inherit Christ as their salvation. Then this book proceeds to tell us that Christ is better than Moses because Christ is the real Apostle sent to us by God and from God to take care of our need in order that God’s house may be built up.<p>Following this, Hebrews tells us that Christ is the real High Priest. Hebrews 4:14-15 says, “Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all respects like us, yet without sin.” Christ is all-inclusive. As the Apostle typified by Moses He comes from God and with God to take care of our need. As the High Priest typified by Aaron He goes to God from us and with us to take care of our case in the presence of God. As the Apostle, Christ is the One sent by God to us to be with us, to care for us, to meet our need, and to settle all our problems that we may enjoy Him as our rest and our everything to be built up as the dwelling place of God. As our High Priest, Christ goes from us to God and stands before God, representing us to care for our case.<h2 class=head1>EXPERIENCING CHRIST’S HEAVENLY PRIESTHOOD IN OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>As our High Priest, Christ has passed through the heavens (4:14). However, if Christ were only in the heavens, how could His priesthood be related to us? We must realize Christ’s priesthood in the spirit. Christ is in the heavens, but today He is the Spirit, and as the Spirit He is in our spirit. Because He is in our spirit, our spirit is related to the heavens. We may illustrate this with electricity. On the one hand, electricity is in the power plant, but on the other hand, it is transmitted into our lamp. Thus, the lamp is related to the power plant by the transmission of the electricity. If there is no current of electricity within the lamp, the lamp is not related to the power plant. But because of the transmission of electricity, although the lamp is in our home, it is still connected to the power plant far away. The transmission of the spiritual “electricity” within us is the all-inclusive Spirit. In Christ’s resurrection He was transfigured to be the Spirit, and in His ascension He is in the heavens. Now the Spirit transmits Christ as the “electricity” into us. Therefore, not only Christ but also the heavens are in us. How can we as persons on the earth be in the heavens? This is possible only by the heavenly Spirit within us. The heavenly Spirit of Christ transmits the heavenly Christ into us. It is by this Spirit that we are connected to the heavens while we are still on the earth. In order to realize the priesthood of Christ, we must experience this transmission in our spirit.
