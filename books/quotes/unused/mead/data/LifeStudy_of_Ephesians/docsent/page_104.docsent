   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOWLINESS, MEEKNESS, AND LONG-SUFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 2 says, With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To have lowliness is to remain in a low estate, and to have meekness is to not fight for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should have these two virtues in dealing with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Long-suffering is to endure mistreatment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should have this virtue in dealing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By these virtues we bear one another; that is, we do not forsake the troublesome ones but bear them in love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word all governs both lowliness and meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It does not mean that there are many kinds of lowliness and meekness; it means that we should have lowliness and meekness in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, we must keep the oneness of the Spirit with all lowliness and meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The problem, however, is that in ourselves we cannot be either lowly or meek.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are honest and sincere, we shall admit that we have no genuine lowliness or meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, we tend to exalt ourselves and to fight in defense of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as we do not have lowliness or meekness, we are not long-suffering and we cannot bear others in love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, Paul charges us to have such a worthy walk.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we would keep the oneness of the Spirit, we must have a proper humanity, a humanity with lowliness, meekness, and long-suffering and a humanity that bears others in love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do not have such a humanity as our capital, then we cannot operate the business of keeping the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fact that the virtues in verse 2 are mentioned before the oneness of the Spirit in verse 3 indicates that we must have these virtues in order to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A TRANSFORMED HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to have the virtues spoken of in verse 2, we need a transformed humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our natural humanity there is no lowliness, meekness, nor long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But these virtues are to be found in our transformed humanity, that is, in the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Matthew 11:29 the Lord Jesus said that He was meek and lowly in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Meekness and lowliness are characteristics of the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Any meekness or lowliness that we may seem to have in ourselves is a pretense and cannot survive any real testing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Praise the Lord that the humanity of Jesus in His resurrection life can be ours today!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more we are transformed, the more of the humanity of Jesus we have.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By having the humanity of the resurrected Christ, we spontaneously have the virtues required to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A PICTURE OF GENUINE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The genuine oneness in the Triune God is seen in the picture of the tabernacle with its forty-eight boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In themselves, the boards were separate from one another, but in the gold they were one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The bars that held the boards together were also made of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we have pointed out elsewhere, the golden bars signify the uniting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The acacia wood signifies humanity, and the gold signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the uniting Spirit there is the element of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that the uniting Spirit is not merely the Holy Spirit of God, but the Holy Spirit mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This mingled spirit is seen in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Romans 8:4 says, That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The spirit here is our human spirit mingled with God s Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This verse clearly points to the mingled spirit, that is, the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the mingled spirit which constitutes the uniting bars, there is the transformed humanity with the virtues of lowliness, meekness, and long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For years I tried to be meek and lowly, but I failed time after time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually I learned that the lowliness, meekness, and long-suffering in 4:2 are not to be found in our natural humanity, but are characteristics of the transformed humanity, the humanity of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This transformed humanity with all its virtues is typified by the acacia wood within the uniting bars.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indicates that in the uniting Spirit there is the transformed humanity, our humanity transformed by the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
