   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Foolish Men Considering Service</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Be a Favor to God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are many people who think that they are granting God a favor by offering themselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Over the past decades, I have always felt uneasy when preachers pleaded with believers in revival meetings to give themselves to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many people give a little money to God and think that they are doing Him a special favor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people offer themselves to serve God and think that they are doing Him a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some people think that they are bestowing honor upon God when they give up a little position in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Their hearts seem to be saying, "I give myself, someone as important as I, to serve God today!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some give up their little positions and think that they are exalting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this is blindness!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is nothing but folly and darkness!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>C. Our Greatest Honor Being to Serve God</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If God in heaven has called us to be His priests, we should be on our knees before Him to receive His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is our greatest honor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has elevated us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not say that we can give anything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We say that our greatest honor lies in God's acceptance of what we offer to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What a tremendous honor that persons such as ourselves can serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is pure grace!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This surely is the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not only a gospel about Jesus' salvation; it is a gospel that even persons such as ourselves can serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is indeed the gospel, a great gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>UPHOLDING THE PRIESTHOOD A. There Being No Church</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>without the Universal Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the church today the priesthood is no longer restricted to only a few people; it has become a universal priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The nation of Israel failed; the church cannot fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The nation of Israel failed in that God's people and God's priests became separated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May there be no separation between God's people and His priests in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the church God's people are His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the people of God are priests of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There must be as many priests as there are brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everyone must come to God to offer up spiritual sacrifices and sacrifices of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everyone should take part in spiritual service.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not a selective ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everyone should come to God to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A church that comes short of universal and direct access to God is not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please bear in mind that there is no church if the priesthood is not universal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The nation of Israel failed; the church should not fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>During the past two thousand years, the scope of the priesthood has never been recovered to include all the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The two thousand years of church history show us a frequent separation between the people and the ministry of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>An intermediary class has time and time again come between God and His people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the work and teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>B. No Longer Tolerating the Intermediary Class</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can no longer tolerate an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can no longer accept a hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can no longer allow priests to stand between God and His children; we can no longer accept an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to see what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church is the place where every child of God is a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot have one person or a few persons monopolizing spiritual service.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They cannot be the only ones through whom God speaks or the only ones through whom we approach God to settle spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such an intermediary class cannot exist in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our controversy with denominations is not a matter of outward forms but a matter of inward content.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today there is a hierarchy in the denominations one group of people is serving God, while the rest are merely pew members.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One group of people is serving God as a profession, while the rest of the pew members, though equally born to be God's children, need to approach Him through them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This hierarchical practice is tolerated by many organizations in Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But we cannot accept any intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We cannot set aside the grace given to the church in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot forsake it as the Israelites did.</S>
