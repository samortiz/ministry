   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-FOUR IN CHRIST AND ACCORDING TO CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 2:8-15; 2 Cor 3:17; 2 Tim 4:22a; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:8-15 Paul s emphasis is that the believers are in Christ and should be according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a fact that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 10 Paul says, And you in Him are made full.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Christ we also have been circumcised, raised up, and made alive vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul s writing is structured around the basic concept that everything is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the expression in Him were removed from 2:8-15, the very structure of Paul s composition would collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 2:8 Paul says, Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Notice the expression according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul s desire is that we would all live and have our being according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be led astray from Christ is to have our being according to something other than Christ, in particular the tradition of men and the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two matters cover everything that is not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today believers and unbelievers alike live, walk, behave, and have their being either according to the tradition of men or according to the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is very difficult to find a person who has his being according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, the Christian walk should be a walk according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We praise the Lord for all the riches we have in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we must go on to live and have our being according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>FACTS AND EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 2:8-15 Paul lists a number of important spiritual facts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a fact that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the Head of all rule and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have been circumcised in Christ, buried in Him, raised up with Him, and made alive in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All these are facts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a fact that the ordinances in writing have been wiped out and that the powers of darkness have been stripped off.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All these facts are related to the matter of what is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if these facts would become our experience, we must be not only in Christ, but also according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The expression in Him refers to the facts, whereas the expression according to Christ refers to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All those who are saved have the position of being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As saved ones, all the facts we have mentioned are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have the right, the title deed, to all these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But whether or not our daily living is according to Christ is altogether another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may have the assurance to declare that we are in Christ, but we probably do not have the boldness to say that our daily walk is according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do you have the confidence to testify that your daily living is according to Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are in Christ, but we do not have our being according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To a large degree, we live according to the tradition of men and the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have the facts, but we are short of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>CARRIED AWAY FROM CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Colossians 2 Paul indicates that the Christ we have received is the mystery of God, in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we need to walk in Him, having been rooted in Him and being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After giving such a word, Paul charges us to beware that no one carries us off as spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Having seen the wonderful fact that we have received Christ as the mystery of God and have been rooted in Him, we must now take heed lest we be carried off from such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you cannot say that you walk according to Christ, this indicates that, in a practical way, you have been carried off from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have received Christ and have been rooted in Him, but as far as your daily living is concerned, you have been carried away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To fail to have our daily walk according to Christ means that we are severed from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as we are severed from Christ, it does not matter whether we are far removed from Him or only a little bit away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For the most part, our daily walk is according to the tradition of men and the elements of the world and not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Tradition is the main component of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without tradition, culture could not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We inherit culture from the traditional practices of our family, society, and country.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Spontaneously and unconsciously, we live according to the cultural traditions we have inherited.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, we live according to the elements of the world, that is, the elementary principles of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Traditions are the practices of culture, whereas the elements are the basic principles of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even we who love Christ and seek after Him are still dominated by these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I hate any aspect of my daily living that is according to the tradition of men or the elements of the world and not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not want to have my being according to Chinese tradition or according to the ethical teaching of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many times I have prayed, Lord, forgive me for living according to the tradition of men instead of according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God s desire is that we walk according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For example, a sister may be very submissive, following either the teaching of the Bible or an ethical standard that is according to her culture.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Such submission, however, may not be according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God does not want any behavior that is not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many saints, after they have been in the church for a period of time, begin to walk according to what may be called the local church way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In a sense, the church life refines our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The humanity of those in the local churches is very high.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, it is possible for us to walk according to our refined humanity and not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Instead of living Christ, we may conform to certain standards or practices.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, a sister who has been in the church life for a while may decide to stop using makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But her decision may not necessarily be made according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Instead of walking according to Christ in this matter, she may simply be conforming to the local church way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Another example is that of a brother who chooses to have short hair instead of long hair.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If this brother were not in the church life, he might prefer to have his hair long.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But because he is in the church, he chooses to wear his hair short.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this matter, however, he also may be conforming to a certain way of life instead of living according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the church life, we should not be conformists; we should live, walk, and have our being according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God s intention is not to have a group of clean, neat, refined people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>His desire is to have a group of people who have their being according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is not sufficient just to be in Christ; we must also walk according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To be in Christ is a matter of position, but to walk according to Christ is a matter of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should dress ourselves and style our hair according to Christ, not according to the tradition of men or the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God s desire is that our daily walk be according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As long as we do not live according to Christ, we have been carried off from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Just as even a thin piece of insulation can stop the flow of electricity, so even the slightest separation from Christ can cause us to be carried away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There is no need to indulge in worldly things in order to be carried off from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Even if you attend the church meetings without walking according to Christ, you will be separated from Him in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the matter of being carried off from Christ, you are no different from Christians who indulge in worldly entertainments.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have been saved, regenerated, and rooted in the all-inclusive and extensive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, it is very easy for us to be carried off from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Where are the Christians today who truly walk according to Christ and not according to man s tradition?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Virtually all believers have been carried away from Christ and live according to some kind of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Where are those Christians who live simply, solely, and uniquely according to Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The believers in Colosse were not carried off from Christ by sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They were carried away by the good traditions of culture and by the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Many Christians are like the Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Although they may live according to high standards and follow the best practices, they may not have their daily living according to Christ.</S>
