   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>On Seeing the Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A piece of glass may hold a little bit of water, but it can never hold the equivalent of a cup of water.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every Christian has received some grace, but individual Christians are not the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if they receive much grace, they can only be considered big pieces of glass.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are still two-dimensional; they are not three-dimensional.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, individuals have to be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What the Lord wants is not individual pieces of broken glass, but a whole cup.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's principle is for one to chase a thousand, and two to chase ten thousand Deut 32:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today, the church is filled with individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But wherever there are two persons who are one, they can drive out ten thousand, eight thousand of which they gain as extra profit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, God wants to see the church preaching the gospel, the church teaching the truth, and the church making the money.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything is placed in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Seeing the Body is one kind of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This salvation is stronger and richer than the first salvation that an individual receives.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once a person has been touched by the Lord, he can no longer say that he can be an individual Christian alone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to allow God to work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A man develops the Body consciousness not through thinking or deduction.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once the self is dealt with, the Body consciousness is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You will see that, on the one hand, you are the Body; on the other hand, you are also a member.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a man sees individualism as a sin, he will submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once a man sees the Body, nothing will become difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a man sees the Body, it will not be difficult for him to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a man sees the Body, it will not be difficult for him to live by faith or to receive answers to prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Lord's work, if a man has not seen the Body, he cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, many things today hinge on seeing the Body truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To Be Obedient, to Be Taught,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>and Not to Assume Headship</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A person has a problem with Body consciousness because he has a problem concerning individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order for a brother to become submissive, his own ideas must first go.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My hands have been listening to my head for forty-five years; they never express their own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They always keep their place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why there is no problem with my body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If my heart tries to set up another head, my body will argue with itself from morning until night.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To remove our individualism, we have to tear down our own head.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to learn to speak as one who is taught, to think as one who is taught, and to act as one who is taught.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Submission is the simplest thing there is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is difficult for a person to submit alone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when there are a lot of people around, it will become easy to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to submit to one another, there is the need for everyone to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Coordination does not come by human thoughts and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If our physical body can have such a wonderful coordination, how much more wonderful should the coordination in the Body of Christ be?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We believe that when Christ's spiritual Body is coordinated together, what we see will be even better and more beautiful, and its result will far exceed what we think.</S>
