   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we have two great gifts, God's written Word and God Himself as the life-giving, indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In our hands, we have the written Word; in our spirit, we have the Spirit Rom 8:16; John 4:24; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to worship and serve God, we need to know what God wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to know this, we need the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Word, that is, in the Scriptures, the God-ordained principles are unveiled for us to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because we have the Spirit, the instant leading is always with us, coming to us at any time in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To know the God-ordained principles in the Scriptures requires skill.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without the skill, we may read the Scriptures but understand them only according to our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why there is the need of training.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the same with the instant leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With the Spirit everything is organic and living, yet there is still the need of training to learn to know the Spirit's instant leading.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To have the God-ordained principles in the written Word alone is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the God-ordained principles in the written Word must become an instant, organic leading to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our practice of being revived every morning, we first take the written Word, in which are the God-ordained principles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But these God-ordained principles must become an instant, organic leading to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the reason that the Lord has given us the Bible and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit comes to make every ordained principle organic to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AN EXAMPLE OF A GOD-ORDAINED PRINCIPLE BECOMING AN INSTANT LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>IN THE BOOK OF ISAIAH</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Isaiah 6 gives an example of a God-ordained principle becoming an instant leading.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 1, Isaiah received the vision of Christ sitting on the throne, and in verse 3, the seraphim called to one another saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts; / The whole earth is filled with His glory."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This praise of the seraphim reminded Isaiah that the Triune God desires His people to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many times in the Old Testament, the Lord says that His people should be holy as He is holy Lev 11:44; 19:2; 20:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is an ordained principle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's people must be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the first five chapters of the book of Isaiah, the prophet Isaiah prophesied a great deal about Israel's degradation, showing how God's elect had become altogether unholy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As Isaiah prophesied, he may have felt that he was better than the children of Israel, but in chapter six, the Lord came in to give Isaiah a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Isaiah surely knew that God's people must be holy, but this vision reminded him of that God- ordained principle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At this time the vision he received was not just a written principle; it became an instant, organic leading of the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, this leading was a person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Isaiah saw a person Christ in His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Upon seeing this vision, Isaiah also saw himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 5, Isaiah said, "Woe is me, for I am finished!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>/ For I am a man of unclean lips, / And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The God-ordained principle of holiness had become an instant leading to Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Merely to have the written Bible with all the ordained principles is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All of the ordained principles in the Bible should become an instant leading to us organically.</S>
