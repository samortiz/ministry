Redemption is necessary for the impartation of the divine life.<p>In order to understand redemption and life-impartation, we may use the illustration of a drama. The story of the Scriptures may be compared to a drama. A wise playwright makes his drama interesting by means of a straight line through the story, along with many twists. If we look into the Scriptures in this way, we first can realize that God has an eternal purpose, which extends like a straight line from eternity past to eternity future. God&#8217;s eternal purpose and heart&#8217;s desire is that He would impart Himself into His creation. He wants to mingle Himself with man, to make Himself one with man, so that He becomes man&#8217;s life and content, and man becomes His expression. In this sense, man may be compared to a bottle to be filled up with God as the living water.<p>In order to realize this eternal purpose, God came in and created many items with man as the center. In God&#8217;s creation man is the very center because man is the vessel to contain God, while all the other items of creation merely provide the environment for man, the central figure. After God created man, He put man before the tree of life, which symbolizes God Himself as life to man. God&#8217;s intention was that man would eat of this tree and receive God Himself into him as his life. Thus, God&#8217;s purpose would be fulfilled. At this very juncture, however, God&#8217;s enemy, Satan, came in and captured, corrupted, and damaged man. This is the first, downward twist as a distraction from the straight line of God&#8217;s eternal purpose.<p>Therefore, God Himself came to be a man. Christ came to the very place where man was, and through His redemption God brought man back to the tree of life. The redemption of Christ for the recovery of fallen man is the upward twist in the line of God&#8217;s original intention. This shows us the position of God&#8217;s redemption in the overall picture of His purpose.<p>By Christ&#8217;s redemption, the fallen and distracted man was redeemed, recovered, and brought back to the tree of life. Then by Christ&#8217;s resurrection this wonderful One imparted Himself into man. From this time on, man had something within him that he never had before. Before the fall, man was merely man, but now something has been added to man, that is, God Himself in Christ. Man was not only brought back to the tree of life, but the life of God was added to man. This is life-impartation.<p>This entire picture shows us the position of redemption. Most Christians today neglect the tree of life and pay their full attention to the &#8220;twists,&#8221; the aspect of redemption. They stress the fact that man fell and became sinful. They speak of man&#8217;s going to hell and of his need for salvation. It is wonderful and precious to speak of God&#8217;s love for the fallen race and the shedding of Christ&#8217;s blood on the cross to redeem us. However, the redemptive work is part of the twists and not on the straight line of God&#8217;s intention. Today&#8217;s Christianity has missed the mark, the goal of God&#8217;s purpose. Very few Christians today are clear about the straight line, that is, the eternal purpose of God, and because of this they emphasize the twists. In these last days we have the deep impression that the Lord will recover this straight line. He will make it the foremost matter, and He will make redemption the secondary matter. By all of the above, we can see the position of the life-imparting of Christ and the role of redemption.<p>When the Lord established His table, He said of the wine, &#8220;Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins&#8221; (Matt. 26:27-28). However, although the Lord stressed redemption, He did not forget the straight line. Therefore, He first said of the bread, &#8220;Take, eat; this is My body&#8221; (v. 26). &#8220;My body&#8221; is on the straight line of God&#8217;s eternal goal, while &#8220;My blood&#8221; for redemption is on the twists.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
