<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1><h1 class="title">IN REST SHALL BE YOUR STRENGTH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 10:38-42; Isa. 30:15; Phil. 4:6-7; Matt. 11:29</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>One day as our Lord came to a certain village, a sister named Martha received Him into her home. She loved our Lord and wanted to do many things for Him in order to please Him. She did this and that; she prepared this thing and that thing. She did many things, but then she became disturbed. Not only was she disturbed, she also worried about many things, and her mind was troubled. Martha, like those who are ill at ease, sought to blame others by going to the Lord and saying, "Lord, does it not matter to You that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to do her part with me" (Luke 10:40). But the Lord answered, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; but there is need of one thing, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her" (vv. 41-42). Oh, the Lord said that only one thing is needed! Martha did many things, but the Lord said that there was need of only one thing. We plan one thing after another and do one thing after another. It seems that we have planned many things and done much, yet there is need of only one thing! There are not many needful things; there is only one thing which is needful!</p><p>Brothers and sisters, what is the one thing that is needful? It is nothing other than Christ Himself&mdash;this is what Mary chose. We can have this needful thing only by sitting quietly before the Lord as Mary did. Every Christian should work, and it is wrong if anyone does not work. The Bible tells us that the man who will not work should not eat (2 Thes. 3:10). We should work diligently. However, we often find no rest within when we work; we may even feel that we have forgotten the Lord. Sometimes we are so busy from morning till evening that we do not find time for prayer or Bible reading before the Lord. When we labor, do some spiritual work, or give assistance to a brother or sister, our motive is for the Lord, yet eventually we become distracted; our heart is disturbed. The problem is that there are too many things that cause us to forget the Lord and let Him go. Let us listen to the Lord, who is telling us that only one thing is needful! This very thing is to have rest in the Lord and to be content in Him.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>How can we live a peaceful and unperturbed life? Let us see what the Lord said. He did not say that one should not work, nor did He say that one should spend half of his time working and the other half dealing with spiritual things. He did not say to Martha that it was wrong to do many things, but He reminded Martha not to let these things enter into her and disturb her. The Lord Jesus did not say that she had done too much; He said that she had considered too much. He did not say that she had taken up too many tasks; He said that she had taken up too many worries. You may work from morning until evening, but you should not be disturbed by it. Many people do not have much to do outwardly, yet they are very busy inwardly. Some people have already spent five sleepless nights worrying about work that needs to be done five days from now. For instance, you only need one hour to visit a friend tomorrow, yet you spend four hours thinking about it in your bed. This kind of thinking is too much! The Lord did not tell us not to work. He said that we can work as much as we need, but that our heart should not be disturbed about it. The Lord will not say that we have done too much; but He will say that our heart should not be disturbed.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, this is the Christian life. We should work and not be lazy. It is necessary to work and to be occupied, but we should be at peace within. There should only be one thing within us&mdash;Christ. This is what the Lord shows us. The Lord asks only one thing of us&mdash;that we remain untouched by whatever circumstance we are in. Outwardly, we may be very busy doing many things, but inwardly there should be only one thing that we do not let go of by any means. Although we may be busy outwardly, we should maintain our fellowship with God. Thank God that there was not only a Martha but also a Mary. Mary chose the best portion&mdash;fellowship with the Lord. The Lord wanted Martha to learn the way of inward rest from her sister, not the way of work. It is all right for us to be a Martha outwardly, but inwardly we should be like Mary, who was in complete union with the Lord. Although outwardly we can be very busy, inwardly we should fellowship with God and be at rest. This is a most precious experience.</p><p>Brother Lawrence had to prepare meals for many people each day. If we were in his place, we might become so busy that we would lose contact with God. However, Brother Lawrence's inner fellowship with the Lord was not disturbed by external things at all. He was indeed a man who knew the presence of God! Although he was outwardly very busy all the time, inwardly he was sitting at the feet of the Lord all the time. Despite the many outward things he did, he was not distracted by them at all.</p><p>This is a most blessed way of life. Every one of us can live this kind of life, which is not in the physical realm or in our feeling but in the depth of our being. Then we will be in constant fellowship with the Lord, living a peaceful and serene life in His presence. We must remember that God has not asked us to be lazy and do nothing. Rather, the Lord wants us to shoulder outward activities on the strength of His indwelling. Although we may be busy from morning until evening, no person or thing should deprive us of our inner peace and rest. We should be busy outwardly but peaceful inwardly. Brothers and sisters, we must not allow the outward things to come and touch us; we have to resist these outward things and not allow them to affect us. However many things there are, we should not let any of them enter into our being. Within us there should be only one person&mdash;Christ. Inwardly, our only occupation is to have fellowship with Christ; if we allow other things to come into us, our inner peace will flee away.</p>
