   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD TO HEAL THE BLINDNESS OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 4 and 5 the Lord Jesus says, "We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After reading these verses, we may wonder how to connect light and blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apparently, light and blindness are not related.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Blindness denotes darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the Gospel of John, blindness issues in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you were blind, you would be in darkness, not able to see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the first Epistle of John, darkness also causes blindness: "But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes" 1 John 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, blindness causes darkness; on the other hand, darkness causes blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the Gospel of John, blindness comes first and then darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But according to the first Epistle of John, we first have darkness and then are blinded by this darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But since we are concerned in this message with chapter nine of the Gospel of John, we need to realize that here blindness is equal to darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the blind man in this chapter needs the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE SIGNS OF THE CLAY, THE LORD'S SPITTLE, AND THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At this point we need to raise an important question: How can the light come into one who is born blind?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We were born blind, and Christ is the light of the world 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But how can this light enter into us?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to this chapter, in order for the light to come into us, we need the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we would understand this, we need to know the significance of the clay, the Lord's spittle, and the anointing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may not regard the words "clay" and "spittle" as positive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of course, the word "anointed" in verse 6 is certainly a positive term.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word "anointing" is a scriptural word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In his first Epistle John says, "You have an anointing from the Holy One," and "His anointing teaches you concerning all things" 1 John 2:20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John, no doubt, takes this word from chapter thirty of Exodus, which speaks of a holy anointing oil v. 25 . This is a further indication that the writings of John are the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our point here is that it is by the anointing that the light of the world is able to come into a man born blind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The anointing in John 9 is a compound formed of earth mixed with spittle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may say that the earth is compounded with the Lord's spittle and mingled with it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In other words, the spittle saturates the earth and permeates it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The earth was dry at first, but after the spittle was mingled with it, the earth became wet and was made into clay.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This clay, therefore, is a compound, and this compound was used as an ointment by the Lord Jesus to anoint the eyes of the blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What the Lord Jesus did in 9:6 can be compared to the creation of man from the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 2:7 says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we see that man's body was formed of the dust of the ground, that the Lord breathed the breath of life into him, and that man then became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The principle is nearly the same in chapter nine of John.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Genesis 2:7 we have dust; in John 9:6 we have the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Genesis 2 the Lord breathed into man the breath of life; in John 9, the Lord spat on the ground and then made clay of the spittle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Clay signifies the natural man, the man created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As those created by God, we all are clay.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is indicated not only by Genesis 2:7 but also by the word of the Apostle Paul: "Has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rom 9:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are vessels made of clay to contain God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The spittle, as something that proceeds out of the Lord's mouth Matt 4:4 , signifies His words, which are spirit and life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The words the Lord speaks issue from His mouth, and His words are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, spittle signifies the words that issue out of the Lord's mouth.</S>
