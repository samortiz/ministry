   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Person and Work of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the person and work of Christ, we must preach that Christ is God incarnated to be a God-man, that He is both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must also preach His redemptive death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His redemptive work He died on the cross for our sins and for us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then He was resurrected so that He could impart Himself into us as the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the gospel we preach is that Christ, the God-man, died for our sins and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse reveals that Christ, the Word, was with God and was God from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the beginning, that is, from eternity past, the Word was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not, as supposed by some, that Christ was not with God and was not God from eternity past and that at a certain time Christ became God and was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ's deity is eternal and absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From eternity past to eternity future, He is with God and He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason in the Gospel of John there is no genealogy regarding Him as in Matthew and Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Gospel of John He is "without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life" Heb 7:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all must be very clear that our Christ was with God and was God from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the incarnation Christ is God manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was manifested in the flesh not only as the Son but as the entire God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the Word, who is the very God, Christ became flesh John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, He is God the Triune God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to realize that the entire God, not only the Son of God, was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 1:14 says that the Word, which is God, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This God, who the Word is, is not a partial God; rather, He is the entire God God the Son, God the Father, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Testament does not say that the Word, who became flesh, was God the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, the New Testament indicates that in the beginning was the Word, and this Word is the entire Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, Christ in incarnation is the entire God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of the influence of traditional teaching, we may think that only the Son of God, not the entire God, was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, the New Testament does not say that the Son of God was incarnated; it says that God was manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that the entire God became incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 1:18 tells us, "No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Father's only begotten Son declared, explained, God by the Word, life v. 4 , light, grace, and reality vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>14, 16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is fully declared in the Son through these five things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1 Timothy 1:15 Paul refers to the redemptive work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ came into the world to be our Savior by incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was God incarnated that He may save us through His death and resurrection in His human body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This should be constantly announced as the gospel, the glad tidings, in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 we have a brief word concerning the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verses 1 and 2 say, "Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you as the gospel, unless you believed in vain."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The gospel here is the full gospel, including the teachings concerning Christ and the church, as fully disclosed in the book of Romans 1:1; 16:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should stand in the full gospel, that is, in the entire New Testament, not just in certain teachings or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1 Corinthians 15:2 "being saved" literally means in the way of salvation Conybeare .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After being justified in Christ and regenerated by the Spirit, we are in the process of being saved in the life of Christ Rom 5:10 until we are mature and conformed to Him in full Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, we have been saved; on the other hand, we are being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have been saved by Christ's death, but we are still being saved in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 1 Corinthians 15:3 and 4 Paul goes on to say, "For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ's death for our sins, His burial for our termination, and His resurrection for our germination with life, according to the prophecies of the Old Testament Isa 53:5-8, 10-12; Psa 22:14-18; Dan 9:26; Isa 53:9; Psa 16:9-10; Hosea 6:2 , are the basic items among the first things of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The last of these items is the most vital in the gospel, for it imparts life to us that we may live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The resurrection of Christ is the vitality of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are many philosophies and religions, but none of them is vital.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the contrary, every one of them is devoid of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, none of them has any vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the Lord's gospel contains life, even resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Resurrection life is a life that has conquered death, a life that entered into death, remained in death for a period of time, and then came out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, this life is a death-conquering and death-subduing life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this reason it is called resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The gospel of Christ not only has life; it also has the life power to subdue death, to conquer death, and to annul death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This life, the life that has subdued, conquered, and nullified death, is resurrection.</S>
