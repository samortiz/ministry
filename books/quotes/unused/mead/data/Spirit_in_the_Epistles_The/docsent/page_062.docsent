   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE SPIRIT IN SECOND CORINTHIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we go on to 2 Corinthians, which experientially is altogether a continuation of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Corinthians the thought of the Holy Spirit is to show us that we need to enter into the spirit to enjoy the pneumatic Christ in the spirit and to experience Christ as the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians shows us that we all are God's children, God's people, and we all are saved ones, saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, some of us are serving in the outer court, some are living in the Holy Place, and only a very small number have entered into the Holy of Holies to enjoy God's blessing Christ Himself in God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although all are saved ones, and all are Israelites, some are in Egypt, some are wandering in the wilderness, and some have entered into Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, 1 Corinthians encourages us to be delivered not only from the flesh but also from the soul, to go on from the flesh, to pass through the soul, and to enter into the spirit and to live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is to enter into the Holy of Holies and enjoy the riches of Canaan in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the main flow of thought in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems that in this book there is a hidden flow, which is not so easy to be seen from the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If it were like a flow on the surface of the earth, it could be easily detected, but since it is a flow beneath the surface, unless you go under the earth, you will not be able to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank the Lord, we have more or less seen this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>BEING FORCED TO LIVE IN SPIRIT DUE TO THE TEARING DOWN THROUGH SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians goes on to speak altogether about how a person lives in the Holy of Holies, in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It also tells us that the reason this one can live in the Holy of Holies, in the spirit, is that he has been outwardly torn down, consumed, in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the entire New Testament, there is only one place which tells us that the Lord does not always answer our prayers in our times of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christianity usually teaches people that when they have some sufferings and have fallen into a difficult situation, they should simply tell the Lord, and the Lord will solve their problems and answer all their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, 2 Corinthians 12 clearly shows us, with an illustration, that Paul had a thorn in his flesh which caused much suffering to him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He prayed three times to the Lord, asking the Lord to remove this thorn, to solve this problem for him, to save him from this suffering, but the Lord seemed to be saying, "I will not do it; I reject this prayer; I will not answer this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am letting the thorn remain there so that you can experience My all-sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order for you to experience that My overshadowing power is perfected in the weakness of man, I have to allow this thorn to make your weakness manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There must be a thorn to tear you down, to completely consume you, so that you will not come out of the Holy of Holies and turn back to yourself again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I leave this thorn in you to keep you in the Holy of Holies, to force you to live in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, I will not answer this prayer of yours."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, this thought is contrary to the teachings of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What you usually hear in Christianity is that if you have any problem, the Lord will rescue you; if you are in hardship, the Lord will visit you; no matter what disaster happens to you, the Lord will take care of it for you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, in the sixty-six books of the Scriptures there is a portion which tells us that the Lord will not listen to this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, remember that in the sixty-six books of the Bible only this one portion tells us that God wants to tear us down.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 16 of chapter four says, "Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Please remember that 2 Corinthians has a particular position in the Holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Experientially, 2 Corinthians occupies an exceptionally high position, and we may even say that it is on the peak, because in this Epistle Paul had already entered into the Holy of Holies and truly remained in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How could he enter the Holy of Holies and remain there?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is because his outer man was consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A thorn which came by the permission of the Lord it was not sent but permitted by the Lord and which was Satan's messenger, consumed Paul, causing him to enter the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to our condition, we surely need some circumstances, circumstances that are not smooth or good but adverse and rough, to force us into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Please remember, when we are at ease, it is easy to get out of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need various adverse situations to force us into the Holy of Holies.</S>
