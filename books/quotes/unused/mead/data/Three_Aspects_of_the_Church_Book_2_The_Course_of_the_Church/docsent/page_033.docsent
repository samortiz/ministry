   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ERRORS IN TRUTH CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BAPTISM AND SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the second century some people erroneously asserted that a person can be saved through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While baptism is related to salvation, a person cannot be saved through baptism without receiving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is wrong to teach that this is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, at the end of the second century some believed that regardless of whether a person believed in the Lord, if he was baptized, he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From that time on, many unsaved ones were added to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This went further than causing a transmutation in administration and organization; it resulted in a transmutation of the basic constituents of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the beginning the constituents of the church were the Lord and those who had His life; it consisted only of those who were saved, not unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The transmutation of the constituents of the church is significant because it resulted in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Taiwan we have baptized many newly saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In principle, we have not done anything wrong, but in the details we have neglected something.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe that some have been baptized without being saved, because the pre-baptism interviews were not conducted carefully enough.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We did not determine whether the candidates for baptism had really contacted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Baptizing unsaved people into the church causes mixture in the constituents of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not baptize unsaved ones into the church; therefore, although the pre-baptism interviews are not that demanding, we must use them to touch the spirit of the candidates.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The social class of those whom we baptize does not matter, but whether they have been regenerated is a real concern.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who have not been regenerated should not be baptized into the church, or the church will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before the end of the second century the heresy of salvation through baptism was already prevailing in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of this erroneous practice, many unsaved ones came into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE PRODUCING OF A MEDIATORIAL CLASS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the second and third centuries some people thought that not everyone was qualified to break the bread and distribute the cup during the Lord s table only a special group of people could do this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore a distinction developed between those who were regarded as the clergy and the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the time of Cyprian, this distinction became the standard rule of the catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only a special group of people who attended to matters of service to God could distribute the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, Christian priests were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The priestly system of Judaism was formally transferred into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the organization, administration, and constituents of the church were transmuted before the end of the third century.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This transmutation continues in Christianity today the constituents of the church are mixed, its administration is hierarchical, and its organization is unified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is entirely different from the church on the day of Pentecost and from what was practiced in the early church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The constituents of the church on the day of Pentecost included only saved ones, its administration was local and without hierarchy, and its organization was not unified, federated, or catholic.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the day of Pentecost the constituents of the church were regenerated people, the administration of the church was local, and the church was not unified organizationally.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CONSTANTINE MIXING POLITICS WITH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By the time of Cyprian the administration and organization of the church had been completely transmuted, but the church had not yet been mixed with human government.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although there had been a transmutation, the church was still separate from human government.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At Cyprian s time human government still persecuted the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Several of those who were responsible for the transmutation of the organization of the church were even persecuted and martyred for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Roman Empire persecuted the church through the end of the third century, that is, for at least two hundred and fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In A.D. 312 Constantine began his reign over the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not long after he ascended to the throne, he accepted Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Originally the Roman Empire persecuted Christianity, but after Constantine accepted Christianity, the Roman Empire changed its tactics.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It not only ceased its persecution of the church but also began to welcome and exalt Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Constantine accommodated Christianity and encouraged Roman citizens to participate in it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He introduced elements of Christianity into his government and also extended his political power into Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Constantine even took advantage of the archbishops in order to increase his power, which resulted in a further mixture of the church and the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Constantine interfered a great deal in the matters of the church, even appointing some bishops.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He presided over the Council of Nicea that is so famous in church history.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There were approximately three hundred bishops present at the council.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Constantine sat on a throne of pure gold and observed the debate among the bishops.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He favored the orthodox group, that is, Athanasius and his followers, by constantly siding with them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, the Council of Nicea ordained a creed that supported the pure faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, Constantine meddled in church affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After his reign, emperors had the power to send bishops away or recall them; the bishops were under the power of the emperor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, politics entered the church, and the church entered politics.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Constantine s influence on the church resulted in an alliance between the church and politics.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Prior to Constantine, the church had not been involved in politics, although it had been transmuted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After Constantine, the church was united with a government the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Constantine s reign marked the beginning of Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The word pergamos has two meanings: high tower and marriage union.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because Constantine accepted Christianity into the Roman Empire, the church became a high tower; in the same way, the church was also married to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After its marriage to the world, the transmutation of the church was complete.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Constantine s acceptance of Christianity strengthened and increased the transmutation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since then, the transmutation has continually gained strength and spread.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By the fifth century, when the Roman Catholic Church became quite prevailing, the transmutation of the organization and administration of the church reached its peak and could not get any worse.</S>
