   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEFORE THE RAPTURE 8:5-14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 5 says, "Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth; there she brought thee forth that bare thee."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This book speaks of the maiden coming up from the wilderness two times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first coming up from the wilderness in 3:6 refers to her forsaking of a wandering life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There she began her absolute union with the Lord in His death, His life, and all His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since then she steadily advanced, until she left the wilderness completely.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although in her latter experience she stopped once or twice, we dare not say that these stops were necessary, but surely we can say that they were excusable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once we leave the wandering life, we leave it for good.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why then does the Lord speak about her coming up from the wilderness a second time, as if she is still in the wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must pay attention to what the wilderness refers to.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The wilderness for us is not just a wandering life, but the world itself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only is there a wilderness in the spiritual realm; there is also a wilderness in the fleshly realm.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must not only be delivered spiritually from the wilderness of wandering, but we must be delivered from this earthly wilderness as well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord reigns within us through the Holy Spirit, we begin to leave behind a fluctuating life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we hear the call for the rapture, we will be delivered from the worldly environment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The cross of Christ delivers us from the spiritual wilderness, and the coming of Christ delivers us from the earthly wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why there is a second coming up from the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is being delivered from this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Holy Spirit once again asks a question through the mouth of a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It seems as if He sees a maiden coming up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved; the closer she gets, the clearer her identity becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here we see that the rapture that delivers us from the wilderness does not happen suddenly, but is a result of a step-by-step walk with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The rapture is the last step of our walk with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All that men see will be the instant change from earth to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But this is merely the last step of the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The beginning of the rapture does not happen then.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a believer is attracted by heaven and walking away from the world step by step, he becomes further and further away from the world, and there will be a clearer and clearer separation between him and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the process is complete, he will find himself waking up before the face of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the way that Enoch was raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must never be misled to think that the rapture is something that will happen suddenly or something that will instantly change our spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the time to prepare ourselves for the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By leaning upon our Beloved, we constantly leave the world behind and come up again and again until the Lord comes to take us away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Leaning upon her beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She seems to be powerless and unable to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Leaning upon her beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She makes herself a burden for her beloved to carry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Leaning upon her beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is as if the hollow of her thigh has been touched.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Leaning upon her beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She seems to find herself pressed beyond measure, and this seems to last until the wilderness journey is over.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only the Lord can prepare us for the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A trusting life is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should trust in Him helplessly until the Holy Spirit exclaims, "Who is this that cometh leaning upon her beloved?"</S>
