   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have heard that Brother Pan Huo-ling from our locality had been sick for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We thank all the brothers and sisters in all the localities for praying for him.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His leaving the world to be with the Lord is surely an excellent state for himself but is undoubtedly heartbreaking news among the co-workers!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I remember last year when Brother Watchman Nee was in K'un-ming, how the passing away of a certain brother triggered him to recall the fading away of many zealous, faithful, honorable, and loving co-workers during the past eight to nine years, and how grief and sorrow swelled up from within him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have the same feeling today!</S>
