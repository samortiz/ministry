   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Then Paul said, "And moreover I show to you a most excellent way" 12:31b .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is something more excellent than the best gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The excellent way is love, which is fully defined in chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaking in tongues is listed last on Paul's positive lists.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then on his negative list in chapter thirteen, it is listed first.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 1 says, "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sounding brass and a clanging cymbal give sounds without life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a genuine illustration of tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 2 says, "And if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without love we are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 3 says, "And if I dole out all my possessions to feed others, and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love, I profit nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows that if we have the gifts or do anything without love, there is a great lack.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need the gifts plus love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 8 Paul said, "Love never falls away.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Love never fails.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>People always associate love with the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But Paul puts love with the spirit in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 4:21 he spoke of coming to them either with a rod or in love and a spirit of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Love is even deeper than the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Love is in the spirit, because it is in our spirit that Christ dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The real love, which is the expression of Christ, goes with our spirit because Christ is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 16:18 Paul said that his spirit had been refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then in verse 24 he said, "My love in Christ Jesus be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His spirit was refreshed and his love was with them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Love goes along with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If our love is merely out of our heart, that is a natural love, not the divine love which is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The love which is the expression of Christ comes out of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In chapter fourteen Paul charges us, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy" v. 1 . This shows that the apostle Paul was a balanced person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said to pursue love and desire spiritual gifts, but he made clear that we need to desire the best gift, which is to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The most important thing, however, is to pursue love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Corinthians had the gifts but they were short of love in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Love is the very God embodied in Christ who lives in our spirit.</S>
