<P>All of the priests as well as the entire tabernacle with all of its parts were under the anointing of the compound ointment. Without this anointing, none of them could have been holy, that is, none of them could have been attached to God, joined to God. God's divine essence would have had nothing to do with any part of the tabernacle or with any one of the priests if they had not been anointed. This means that under the anointing of the compound Spirit, there is the dwelling place of God, the church life, the priesthood, and the real serving body.</P><P>We have to see that the Spirit is no longer the Spirit of God possessing merely divinity; the Spirit today is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment. The compound ointment in Exodus 30 is the holy anointing oil. To be holy is to be one with God. Regardless of how perfect you are, if you are not one with God and if God is not one with you, you are not holy.</P><P>What we need today in the church life is the anointing of the holy anointing oil, the compound Spirit. We can never build up a proper church life by teachings. Many years ago when people came to me with questions and problems, I was able to give them an answer. Today I have only one thing to say: "Go to the Lord and ask Him." Many years ago I taught people how to take care of their children, but that teaching did not work. Teaching does not work. If you teach me to be humble again and again, I can never be humble. The more teaching I get about being humble, the prouder I will become. I could give you the best teaching on how we need to love one another, but eventually we will argue with one another. Teaching stirs up the thinking of the mentality, the exercise of the mind. It does not minister life to people. What we need today is not teaching but the anointing.</P><P>Every part of the tabernacle had to be anointed. It would have been foolish to teach the parts of the tabernacle to be holy. They did not need teaching to be holy. They needed something to make them holy. As the New Testament dwelling place of God, we also need something to make us holy&#151;the compound Spirit. Do not teach me; instead, pour the compound Spirit upon me. Then even though I may not know the teaching of holiness, I am really holy. What we need is the reality, not the empty teaching. We need the reality of brotherly love, not the teaching. We need the essence of love, not the mere terminology of love. What we need today is to be anointed with God's essence by the anointing of the compound Spirit.</P>
