   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE AUTHORITY OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the position of prayer is ascension, the authority of prayer is also ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With the position of prayer there is the authority of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever a Christian does is not only a matter of power, but even more, a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, when preaching the Word you need not only power but also authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is true of some who pray before God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They not only have power but also authority, for they are in the heavenly position.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>People often say that in prayer you need to remove sins, to have faith, and to hold on to God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But gradually you will see that these do not always work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may have been full of faith, yet God did not bring what you prayed for to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You held on to God's promise, yet the promise also failed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you are willing to learn some lessons of prayer, you will gradually be able to see that it is not a matter of believing or holding on to the promise; rather, it is a matter of seeing the position of prayer through God's visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You will then be able to perform the task of prayer in the heavenly realm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At this time, your prayer is a prayer of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not a matter of your believing or holding on to the promise, but it is that you have the position and the authority to perform this task.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has no alternative but to approve such prayer, and He surely will approve it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you arrive at this place, you will know that there are certain things for which you cannot pray, because God does not allow you to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The most you can do is to discuss such a matter with God, saying, "O God, may I pray for this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If You will, please bring it to pass."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You must not say, "O God, You must do this, for I have laid hold of Your promise."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why is it that at times when you pray in this way, no answer comes?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is because God has not given you that promise.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not only a matter of dealing with sins or confessing your wrongs, but a matter of asking: where are you? what is your nature? and what kind of atmosphere are you in?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are in the realm of the heavens, I am certain that eight out of ten of your prayers will be eliminated, for they are unnecessary, and you will not be able to pray them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You know that they are not the things for which you should pray in such a standing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is hardly anything else that demands from us more than prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only in prayer can you see clearly what you are, what your condition is, and where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Generally, in other circumstances, you have no way to find out where you are, but once you are in prayer, you may discover that you are altogether outside the heavenly realm.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this reason, when one first believes in the Lord, he dares to pray for anything; but later, the longer he has been following the Lord, the narrower is the sphere of his prayers and the less bold he is in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He dares not to pray for this and he dares not to pray for that.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more you grow in the Lord, the more you will realize that prayer has its position and sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In such a position and within such a sphere there can be such an authority.</S>
