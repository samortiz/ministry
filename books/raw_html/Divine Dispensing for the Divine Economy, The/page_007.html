<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE APOSTLE'S STEWARDSHIP<br>DISPENSING THE RICHES OF CHRIST<br>AND CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME<br>IN THE HEARTS OF THE SAINTS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:2-5, 7-11, 14-19</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FATHER'S CHOOSING, THE SON'S REDEEMING,<br>AND THE SPIRIT'S SEALING ISSUING IN THE CHURCH</H2><P>According to chapter one of Ephesians, the church has been constituted for its existence through the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The dispensing of the Divine Trinity is of the Father as the source (vv. 3-6), of the Son as the course (vv. 7-12), and of the Spirit as the flow (vv. 13-14). The dispensing of the Father as the source includes the Father's choosing (v. 4) and predestination (v. 5). The Father's intention in choosing us is to dispense His holy nature into us so that we may be holy. The Father's predestination is so that we will receive the Father's divine life. Upon receiving the Father's divine life, we are born of God to be His sons in order to enjoy the sonship.</P><P>The church is also constituted through the Son's redeeming. The Father chose and predestinated us. Then the Son came in to redeem us. The Son's redeeming brought us into a condition in which we could become the Father's inheritance. God the Father inherits only that which has the divine nature. His inheritance must come up to the standard of His divinity. For this reason, the redemption of Christ must bring us into God Himself. His redemption is not just a matter of redeeming us from sin; it is even more a matter of redeeming us into God Himself, into His very divine element. This divine element constitutes us into a precious treasure for God's inheritance.</P><P>The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity according to Ephesians 1 consummates in the Spirit's sealing (vv. 13-14). The entire being of the complete God reaches our being through the sealing of the Spirit. The sealing of the Spirit saturates the sealed ones. The Spirit as the living seal is also the sealing ink applied to our inward being in the image of the seal. The ink stamped onto a piece of paper will eventually become dry, but the Spirit as the sealing ink remains "wet" all the time unto eternity. Because the Spirit as the sealing ink remains "wet," the Spirit continually saturates and permeates us until our entire being&#151;spirit, soul, and body&#151;is sealed. Eventually, through the divine sealing, we human beings become the expression not only of the God who creates, but also of the regenerating, sanctifying, transforming, and glorifying God. We become His expression, His fullness. This is the aim and goal of the divine economy, God's eternal arrangement as His eternal plan. God desires to make His chosen ones His expression, His fullness, in a corporate way.</P>
