   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Lord's Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Revelation 3:11 and 12 we have the Lord's promise to the overcomers in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To overcome in this epistle means to hold fast what we have in the recovered church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 11 the Lord says, "I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown.''</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The recovered church has gained the crown already.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, if she does not hold fast what she has in the Lord's recovery until the Lord comes back, her crown may be taken away by someone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Being a reward from the Lord, this crown needs to be kept until He comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 3:12a the Lord says, "He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore.''</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 2:17 the overcomer becomes a transformed stone for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here the overcomer will be made a pillar built into the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because he is built into God's building, "he shall by no means go out anymore.''</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom as a prize to the overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 3:12b the Lord goes on to say concerning the overcomer, "I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.''</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here the Lord speaks of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The New Jerusalem is not a physical city but a composition of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This composition will appear first in the millennium as the totality of all the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These overcomers will bear the name of God because they have God's nature in them; and they will bear the name of God's city because they are God's city.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the overcomers will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Greek, Laodicea means the "opinion, the judgment, of the people or of the laymen."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church in Laodicea as a sign prefigures the degraded recovered church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Less than a century after the Lord recovered the proper church in the early part of the nineteenth century, some of the recovered churches "assemblies'' became degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This degraded recovered church differs from the reformed church signified by the church in Sardis; it also differs from the proper recovered church signified by the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The degraded recovered church, signified by Laodicea, will exist until the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. The Condition of the Church at This Stage</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish you were cold or hot.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to vomit you out of My mouth'' Rev 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once the recovered church becomes degraded, it is lukewarm neither cold nor hot.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to verse 16b, the Lord is about to vomit the lukewarm ones out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we become lukewarm, we are not fitting for the Lord's move and shall be vomited out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the recovered church becomes degraded, she is in danger, unless she repents to be hot in seeking the rich experiences of the Lord, of being vomited out of the Lord's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be vomited out of the Lord's mouth is to lose the enjoyment of all that the Lord is to His church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 17 the Lord continues, "Because you say, I am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.''</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The degraded recovered church "assembly'' boasts of her riches mainly in the knowledge of doctrines .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She does not realize that she is poor in life, blind in sight, and naked in conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 18 the Lord goes on to say, "I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see.''</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To buy requires the paying of a price.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The degraded recovered church needs to pay a price for the gold, the white garments, and the eyesalve, which she desperately needs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Revelation 3:20a the Lord says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.''</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The door here is not the door of individuals but the door of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church in Laodicea has knowledge, but she does not have the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord, the Head of the church, is actually standing outside the degraded church, knocking at her door.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that, in a very practical way, the degraded recovered church is Christless.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This church has Christ in name but not in presence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In actuality, the Lord is outside her door.</S>
