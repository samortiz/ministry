 <h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL REALITY NOT BEING<br />
PRODUCED BY IMITATION</h2>
<p>The reality of everything that we believe is in the Holy Spirit. What we believe does not come to us through teaching, rebuking, exhortation, copying, or imitation. Any living that is the result of imitation is not a genuine Christian living. The genuine Christian living does not come from imitation or teaching but from the Spirit. In the past, there was a brother from Germany named George M&#252;ller. This brother knew how to come near to God and receive the leading of the Spirit in his spirit. He was one who had many experiences of faith. As a result, many Christians from the past imitated him, and even today many continue to do so. However, none of those who have tried merely to imitate him have learned to do so successfully, because spirituality does not come from learning or imitation. Spiritual reality depends on the human spirit touching the Spirit of God. Because spiritual reality is in the Holy Spirit, in order for a person to have it, his human spirit has to touch the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIVING BEING<br />
A MATTER OF TURNING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Teachings in themselves do not have reality. Thus, being a Christian does not depend on teachings. Spiritual reality depends on the Holy Spirit, and today this exceedingly rich Spirit is dwelling in our spirit. As long as we turn to our spirit, we will touch the Spirit who is God Himself and who contains all spiritual riches and reality. If we learn to reject our emotion, desires, inclinations, views, thoughts, and opinions, putting them in a secondary position, and learn to turn to our spirit, we will touch the Spirit, and we will touch God. Eventually, this Spirit will be to us the reality of whatever we need. When we need shining, we will receive shining, when we need guidance, we will receive guidance, and when we need resurrection power, we will receive resurrection power. The Spirit today is all-sufficient and surpassingly rich. Everything of God, including all that He has accomplished, passed through, and attained, is now in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit has already entered into our spirit.</p>
<p>The secret to having a normal Christian living is to deny our mind, our emotion, and our will, putting everything we have in second place, and to turn to our spirit, the deepest part of our being. Our inmost part is our spirit, and the One who dwells in our spirit is the Holy Spirit. All spiritual riches and reality are in the Holy Spirit. Thus, genuine Christian living is not a matter of how much teaching we have heard or understood or of how much resolution and determination we have; genuine Christian living is a matter of living in our spirit. There is only one basic lesson to learn for our Christian living&mdash;to turn to our spirit. As long as we turn to our spirit, our mind, emotion, and will spontaneously are put in second place, and our spirit will have the first place. Then we will be able to contact and touch the Spirit of God in our spirit that we may touch the reality of the Holy Spirit. All the spiritual reality that we need can be received by us in this Spirit because all spiritual reality is in the Holy Spirit.</p>
