   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE TEMPERING OF THE BODY AND CARING FOR THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider some verses in 1 Corinthians 12.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 22 Paul says, "But much rather, the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may think that the stronger ones are needed but that the weaker ones are burdensome.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But this verse says that the weaker ones are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are necessary for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the local church, therefore, there is the need for the weaker ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE TEMPERING OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 24 Paul tells us that "God has tempered the body together."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For the building up of the Body there is the need for tempering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order for God to temper the Body, the weaker members are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul's word here was not only according to the revelation he had received, but also according to his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In his experience Paul realized that God needed the weaker members in order to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may think that if every member of the church in Anaheim were a Peter, a Paul, or a John, the church would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps it would be wonderful, but it would not be tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It would not be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord does not want a church that is extreme and unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BEAUTIFYING THE LESS HONORABLE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Continuing verse 22, verse 23 says, "Those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members have more abundant comeliness."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we consider that a certain brother or sister is less honorable, then we need to clothe that one with more abundant honor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that we need to beautify him by clothing him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the weaker ones are worthy of our respect because they are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, all the seemingly less honorable ones need to be clothed with more abundant honor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After these members are clothed with honor, they will have more abundant comeliness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With what are we to clothe the apparently less honorable members?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must clothe them with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the book of Exodus, the tabernacle had four layers of coverings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These coverings typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, all the textiles related to the tent of meeting are types of Christ in different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to clothe others with Christ, we need to experience Him in a rich way as our clothing, covering, and beautification.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we shall be able to clothe our brothers and sisters with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose a certain sister is inclined to argue with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, suppose her husband, a brother in the church, has a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In your eyes this brother and sister may not be very honorable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What should you do with them?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Should you give up on them or criticize them?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No. If you are faithful to shepherd them, you will clothe them with Christ by ministering Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It will not help to adjust this sister by teaching her to submit to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In speaking to her about her habit of arguing with her husband, you need to care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may say, "Sister, in our daily life we should not only follow the Lord Jesus, but also live by Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you argue with your husband, you are not living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our desperate need today is to live by Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps such fellowship will stir up that sister to pray that she may live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In her prayer she may ask the Lord to help her to live by Him in dealing with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through this kind of shepherding the sister is clothed and beautified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is ministered to her as her beautifying element.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is what it means to clothe the less honorable ones with the honorable Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This should take place continually in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By being instructed how to take Christ as life and how to live by Him, we shall eventually overcome our habit of arguing or of losing our temper.</S>
