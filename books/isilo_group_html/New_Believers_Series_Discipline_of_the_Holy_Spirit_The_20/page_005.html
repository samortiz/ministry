From the life of Jacob in Genesis, we can see the meaning of constitution.</P><P>Jacob's life began from a low point. He struggled with his older brother in his mother's womb and strove to be the firstborn by holding on to his brother's heel. He was crafty and greedy, always deceitful and taking advantage of others. He deceived his own father, brother, and uncle. But in the end he was deceived by his uncle and his sons. He tried his best to prosper, but in the end he found himself in a famine. We can say that Jacob's way was fraught with suffering. Some people spend their lives in ease and comfort, but Jacob's life was full of affliction.</P><P>While he was going through his sufferings, God was breaking him down again and again. He suffered one thing after another. Every experience he went through was a suffering to him. But thank God, after going through so much suffering in His hand, he finally acquired a touch of God's holiness. We see this when he was in Egypt. There we see a gentle, humble, bright, and dignified man. He was so meek and humble that he could ask for grace and mercy from his son. Yet he was so crystal clear that he could utter prophecies which Abraham could not utter. He could give blessings which Isaac could not give. He was so dignified that even Pharaoh bowed his head to receive his blessing. This shows us that through God's breaking work, the lowly Jacob had become someone God could use. Jacob had become a man of God!</P><P>After years of breaking, God constituted Jacob with Himself. This is why we can see such a beautiful picture at Jacob's deathbed when he leaned on the top of his rod and worshipped God. Though he was sick in bed, he could still lean on the top of his staff and worship God. This proves that he still remembered his pilgrim life and had not given up his pilgrim characteristic. At first he struggled to sit up, put his feet down by the bed, and prophesied. After prophesying, he gathered up his feet, gave up his breath, and died. The way he died was beautiful! This is indeed a beautiful picture.</P><P>We can muse carefully upon the whole life of Jacob. At the time he was born, I am afraid no one had a worse "taste" than he had. But when he left the world, his old taste was gone altogether. What we see is a man fully constituted by God.</P><P>We must realize that everything that comes upon us is for our edification one way or another. God tears us down through all kinds of sufferings. The tearing down can be quite painful. But after we pass through these trials, something will be constituted into us. In other words, when trials arise, it may appear that we are failing, but His grace will always carry us through. In the process of overcoming our trials, something is wrought into us. As we overcome our trials again and again, the constitution within us grows day by day. On the one hand, God puts us through difficult circumstances and tears us down through our trials. On the other hand, something is added into us as we rise from our trials.</P><P>Thank God that we have the discipline of the Holy Spirit. May God have mercy on us. May He break us and constitute us through the discipline of the Holy Spirit so that we may reach maturity.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>New Believers Series: Discipline of the Holy Spirit, The #20 &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
