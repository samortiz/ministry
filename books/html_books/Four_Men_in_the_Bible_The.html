<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee at a young people&rsquo;s training in Taiwan on February 8 through 12, 1972. According to the <em>Church News</em> report for this year, Brother Lee returned to Taiwan from the United States on January 24 and stayed there for twenty-six days. Other messages given in Taiwan during this period have been published in <em>The Lord&rsquo;s Recovery of Eating</em> and <em>Eating the Lord.</em></p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:45, 47; Eph. 2:15; Rev. 12:5; Gen. 1:26; Matt. 18:3; Gen. 2:7-9; Prov. 20:27; Job 32:8; John 4:24; 2 Cor. 4:6</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING A BOOK ON MAN</h2>
<p>The Bible is rich and all-inclusive. Some say that the Bible is a book on God, and this is true. But if we read the Bible carefully, we will see that the Bible is also a book on man. The Bible speaks very clearly and accurately about man. Numerous books have been written about the origin of man, but most of these writings are merely doctrines and theories. Based on Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution, for example, many people believe that man evolved from apes and monkeys. The theory of evolution, however, is an unverified deduction that does not explain the real origin of man. There was even a report that Darwin expressed regret on his deathbed for advocating the theory of evolution and that he repented to believe in the true God who created all things. The only book in the whole world that thoroughly and accurately explains man is the Bible. If we want to know man, that is, to know ourselves, we must know the Bible. The Bible is a book about man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN</h2>
<p>Although the Bible speaks of countless men, in one sense it speaks only of four men. The Bible begins by speaking of Adam. According to the revelation of the Scriptures, Adam is the first man, and the Lord Jesus is the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45). The first man is Adam, and the last Adam, who is also the second man, is the Lord Jesus (v. 47). <em>The second man</em> is an expression full of significance. Adam is the first man, and the Lord Jesus is the second man. Hence, in God&rsquo;s eyes there are only two men, Adam and the Lord Jesus; there are no other men in between these two.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that all men are in Adam and that all men are a part of Adam. Hence, even though many men were born between Adam and the Lord Jesus, such as Cain, Abel, Enosh, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Solomon, Jeremiah, and many others, they all were part of Adam, the first man. This is like our arms, hands, ears, and eyes being a part of us. Because we all are descendants of Adam and issued out from him, we all have the same surname.</p>
<p>The first man is Adam; the second man is Christ. The third man is the new man in Ephesians. Verse 15 of chapter 2 says, &ldquo;That He might create the two in Himself into one new man.&rdquo; This new man is the church. Thus, there are the first man, the second man, and the third man, which is the new man. The Old Testament is the history of the first man, the Gospels in the New Testament are the biography of the second man, and Acts to Revelation contain the history of the third man, the church, as the one new man. Revelation 12:5 speaks of the fourth man, the man-child. The last book of the Bible can be considered as the biography of the fourth man, the man-child.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD CALLING YOUNG MEN</h2>
<p>The first man, Adam, was created by God in His image so that God could be expressed through man (Gen. 1:26). This speaks of the purpose of man&rsquo;s creation. Furthermore, if we want to be used by God to express Him, we must be young men, not old men. The older saints may feel disappointed when they hear this word, but I have spent much time in the Bible, and it is hard to find a verse that speaks of God calling someone who was old. If you say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you are old,&rdquo; I would say, &ldquo;I am not old; I am younger than you.&rdquo; The Bible&rsquo;s definition of young and old is not based on age. The Lord said, &ldquo;Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (Matt. 18:3). We should become like little children because a child is not preoccupied; he is completely &ldquo;blank.&rdquo; He is not subjective, nor does he have opinions, biases, or old doctrines. This is the meaning of being young in the Bible.</p>
<p>An old person is full of opinions, feelings, and biases. This is the reason that it is difficult to handle elderly persons who are over fifty years old. When they are asked a question, they are full of opinions, biases, assertions, and prejudices. When an old person hears a word about loving the Lord, he will say, &ldquo;It is not enough merely to love the Lord. There must also be actions that demonstrate our love.&rdquo; If we say, &ldquo;That is right; there also must be actions that demonstrate our love,&rdquo; he will say, &ldquo;But not all actions are worthwhile.&rdquo; It seems as if nothing can satisfy an old person who is like this. When we speak of one matter, he will speak of another, and when we speak of that matter, he will speak of yet another matter.</p>
<p>Some still may wish to argue with me, saying, &ldquo;When the Lord Jesus was born, the elderly Simeon and the elderly Anna were in the temple.&rdquo; Indeed, these two feared the Lord very much and were very spiritual (Luke 2:25-38). But when the Lord Jesus called His disciples, He did not go to the temple and ask, &ldquo;Where is Simeon?&rdquo; Neither did He say, &ldquo;Simeon&rsquo;s experience will be very useful. I wish to invite him to come with Me.&rdquo; When the Lord Jesus came, He was a young man, fresh and new, without any old concepts. What would have happened if the Lord Jesus had said to Simeon and Anna, &ldquo;Follow Me. Let us go fishing by the sea&rdquo;? Simeon may have said, &ldquo;Lord, I only know how to pray; I do not know how to fish,&rdquo; and Anna may have said, &ldquo;Lord, I have never left the temple; I cannot go with You.&rdquo; With such responses, the Lord would have been unable to go on. Hence, the Lord Jesus did not call those who were old to follow Him.</p>
<p>When the Lord called James and John, He did not call their father Zebedee. The Lord called only his young sons to follow Him. When He called, they left their father and followed Him (Matt. 4:21-22). The Lord did not call old people in the temple, nor did He call old people by the sea. The Lord called young people, because young people do not have so many opinions or prejudices. Those with opinions and prejudices are old; those without opinions and prejudices are young. All those with opinions, prejudices, and biases are old, and the Lord cannot call them.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD CREATING MAN FOR THREE FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>A young person who is without opinions and prejudices can be used by God. According to the record of the creation of man at the beginning of Genesis, God created man for three functions. First, man was created in God&rsquo;s image in order to express God (1:26). God desires to be expressed through man. If we want to express God, we need to let go of our opinions because the most frustrating thing to God is our opinions. Our opinions are a great hindrance to the expression of God. When we hold on to our opinions, we become old, and God cannot use us. As a consequence, we lose God.</p>
<p>If we want to be blessed, we must drop our opinions. We have to let go of our prejudices, put away our biases, empty ourselves from within, and say to the Lord, &ldquo;I do not know anything, and I have nothing. I do not want anything. I want to be an empty vessel for Your use.&rdquo; We must have thorough prayer, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I want to be a young person, not an old person. Empty me. Empty not only the sins and the world but also my opinions, prejudices, biases, and assertions. I want to be an empty vessel to be filled with You and to express You according to Your image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second, man was created to exercise dominion for God (v. 26). God created man in His image and gave him the authority to exercise dominion for Him. When we have God&rsquo;s image, we have God&rsquo;s dominion. God uses man not only for His expression but also to exercise His dominion. Today we need to overcome our circumstances, we need to overcome all the persons, things, and affairs that bother us, and we need to overcome the attacks of Satan. We do not need to strive in ourselves, because striving is vain. We need to be young and to let God occupy us and fill us. When God fills us, Satan will spontaneously be under our feet. When we have God&rsquo;s image, we have God&rsquo;s dominion. When we are full of God, we are full of God&rsquo;s authority. When we have God&rsquo;s authority, the authority of darkness is under our feet, and all our circumstances are under our feet. When our inner being is occupied by God, we bear God&rsquo;s image and exercise God&rsquo;s dominion to deal with His enemy.</p>
<p>Third, man was created to contain God&rsquo;s life. In order to express God and deal with Satan, we must receive God&rsquo;s life. When we empty ourselves, God will fill us with His life. After God created man with His image and gave him dominion, God put man in front of the tree of life so that he would partake of the tree of life (2:8-9), that is, so that man would take God in as life. God&rsquo;s life is in man so that man can express God&rsquo;s image and exercise God&rsquo;s dominion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD CREATING MAN WITH A SPIRIT TO RECEIVE HIM</h2>
<p>In order for man to fulfill this threefold function, God created man in a particular way: He created man with a spirit. Man&rsquo;s outer shell was made from the dust of the ground (v. 7). This fact is fully proven by science, which shows that the composition of the human body is the same as dust or clay from the ground. In clay there are salt, sulfur, calcium, iron, copper, and other elements. In the composition of the human body, these elements also are present. However, our body is only an outer shell. Within us there is a spirit, which was formed when God breathed the breath of life into man (v. 7). Every man has a spirit within him (Prov. 20:27; Job 32:8).</p>
<p>God created man with a spirit because He is Spirit (John 4:24), and His purpose is that man would receive Him as Spirit in man&rsquo;s spirit. Consider the matter of air. If our body did not have a breathing organ, we would not be able to receive air into us. Thankfully, our body has a breathing organ to breathe in air. Similarly, we have an organ that is able to receive God who is Spirit. This organ is our human spirit. Our spirit is a God-receiving organ.</p>
<p>We can also consider a camera. Once a camera shutter opens, the film within the camera receives light from the outside, and this light imparts the scenery onto the exposed film. Second Corinthians 4:6 says, &ldquo;The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts.&rdquo; Man has a spirit, and our spirit is like the film in the camera. Whenever we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; we &ldquo;take a picture.&rdquo; This is very practical. Animals do not have a spirit. No matter how much a puppy barks or how much a cow moos, they are not taking any &ldquo;pictures.&rdquo; Even though the chirping of a bird is quite pleasant to the ear, there is no receiving that results from its chirping. However, when we call on the name of the Lord, our inner being is &ldquo;exposed,&rdquo; because we receive the Lord by calling on His name.</p>
<p>Through our study of the Bible and our experiences over the past several decades, we have discovered that the spirit within man is like photographic film that can receive the Lord as the Spirit. Hence, we need to open our being continually. We need to say, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen. O Lord, Hallelujah! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; This is the way for us to receive the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WONDERFUL PERSON JESUS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 9, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:47; 1 Tim. 2:5; Heb. 2:6, 9; Matt. 4:3-4; 26:63-64; Acts 7:55-56; John 1:51; 5:27; Rom. 5:17, 19</h1>
<h2 class="head1">JESUS BEING A WONDERFUL PERSON</h2>
<p>The Bible shows that the first man, Adam, failed. He failed because he did not take God in; that is, he did not eat of the tree of life. Instead, he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 3:1-7). This tree signifies Satan as the source of death, just as the tree of life signifies God as the source of life. God wanted Adam to contact Him, but instead, he contacted Satan and took in the wrong element.</p>
<p>After the first man failed, God did not forsake His eternal purpose. God never gives up on what He has ordained. What God ordains will be accomplished. Thus, at the fullness of the time, God in the Son came as the second man (Gal. 4:4).</p>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; Everyone knows that the One who became flesh is Jesus. God became flesh. This is truly a wonderful matter. However, unbelievers and even many in Christianity, including theologians, do not have a clear understanding of this matter. This matter is so mysterious that it is incomprehensible to the fallen human mind. It is not a concept that comes naturally to the human mind. Nevertheless, I must say that God became flesh. This is a great matter in human history.</p>
<p>God become flesh when He was born of a virgin. The prophecy of Isaiah in the Old Testament clearly says, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel&rdquo; (7:14). <em>Immanuel</em> means &ldquo;God with us.&rdquo; The son spoken of in this verse is very wonderful; He is a man, yet He is God; He is God, yet He put on flesh. He is God with man; this is Jesus.</p>
<p>The Bible certainly presents Jesus as a wonderful person; even history testifies that Jesus is a wonderful person. In human history there has never been a person as wonderful as Jesus. Every nation, even atheistic nations that oppose Him, regard the year of Christ&rsquo;s birth as the beginning of a new era. The Chinese know that the first year of an emperor&rsquo;s rule establishes the start of a new era and indicates that China, during that era, belongs to that emperor. Currently, the whole world is in an era based on the year of Jesus&rsquo; birth. Even nations that are against God and resist Jesus unknowingly acknowledge that they belong to Christ. Jesus is so wonderful. Even though some may oppose Him, they still acknowledge Him.</p>
<p>When Joseph Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union, which was strongly opposing God, he was served by a military marshal named Beria, who was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people. When Stalin died, Beria lost a power struggle, and he was discharged from service and executed. In 1953 I saw a newspaper report that contained a picture of his execution. According to the report, when Beria was taken to the place of his execution, he was granted one request. Incredibly, he asked for a Bible and began to pray. This shows that even those who profess to oppose Jesus still acknowledge Him in some way or another. Last year I went to Chicago and stayed at an American brother&rsquo;s home. He had a booklet concerning the repentance and conversion of Nikita Khrushchev, who eventually succeeded Stalin. I was amazed that Khrushchev, the one who dealt with Beria, heard the gospel and repented of his sins.</p>
<p>Saul of Tarsus resisted the Lord Jesus and was devoted to binding all who called upon the name of the Lord Jesus. One day, as he went from Jerusalem and drew near to Damascus, the Lord Jesus appeared to him and said, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; And He said, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you persecute&rdquo; (Acts 9:4-5). Saul thought that he was persecuting only the followers of Jesus, such as Stephen, but the Lord said that Saul was persecuting the Lord because the Lord Jesus and His believers had become one great person. After the Lord Jesus appeared to Saul of Tarsus, he became a believer and an apostle. Jesus is indeed a wonderful person.</p>
<p>Isaiah 7:14 says, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.&rdquo; Verse 6 of chapter 9 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / ...And His name will be called / ...Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; The baby who was in the manger in Bethlehem was the mighty God. He was a Son born of man, yet He was also the eternal Father. He is the Son, yet He is the Father. This is truly wonderful. Our Lord Jesus is such a wonderful One. He is the second man. Regrettably, most of the speaking in Christianity regarding the Lord Jesus relates to His status as God; seldom is there speaking regarding His status as a man. Although Christians confess that the Lord Jesus came into the world as a man to be our Savior, the depths of this confession are rarely considered.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD ACCOMPLISHING HIS ETERNAL PURPOSE<br />
THROUGH MAN</h2>
<p>We need to consider the humanity of the Lord Jesus because God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is accomplished through man. God cannot accomplish His purpose without man. His eternal purpose is accomplished in man and through man.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s expression of Himself is through man. Man is a God-expressing vessel. Without man, God&rsquo;s expression would not be fully manifested. When the first man failed, a second man came. The second man, Jesus, came to express God. During His thirty-three and a half years on the earth, He was expressing God. Prior to Jesus&rsquo; coming, no one had ever seen God, but when He, as God, came in the flesh, He, as the man Jesus, declared God (John 1:14, 18). This shows that the expression of God is through man.</p>
<p>God also has an adversary, Satan. However, God does not want to deal with Satan from His position as God. If God dealt with Satan in this way, He would be lowering His standing as God. Consequently, He deals with Satan through man. Without man, God is unwilling to directly deal with Satan. When the Lord Jesus was tempted in the wilderness, Satan said to Him, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread&rdquo; (Matt. 4:3). Satan, being very crafty, tried to draw the Lord Jesus away from His position as a man so that He would stand on His position as the Son of God. The Lord Jesus knew of Satan&rsquo;s subtle intention and said, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;Man shall not live on bread alone&rsquo;&rdquo; (v. 4). The Lord Jesus came as man to defeat Satan. The greatest threat to Satan was the humanity of Jesus.</p>
<p>Satan tempted the Lord Jesus in the wilderness, and when the Lord Jesus was judged by Caiaphas the high priest, Satan again tempted Him to stand on His position as the Son of God. When Caiaphas said, &ldquo;Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God,&rdquo; the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You have said rightly. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven&rdquo; (26:63-64). Prior to His crucifixion, the Lord Jesus stood in His position as the Son of Man. When He ascended, He was a man, and in His coming back, He will still be a man. Satan is most fearful of the Lord Jesus in His status as a man because God has chosen to deal with Satan through man.</p>
<p>Two more verses speak of the Lord as a man who has come to deal with Satan. The first verse, Genesis 3:15, indicates that the serpent&rsquo;s head would be bruised by the seed of the woman. Satan&rsquo;s head is bruised by the seed of a woman, and the Lord Jesus, who was born of a virgin, is this seed. God did not come only in His divinity in order to deal with Satan; rather, He came as the seed of a woman, being born of a virgin, in order to bruise Satan&rsquo;s head. The second verse, Hebrews 2:14, says, &ldquo;Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil.&rdquo; Jesus partook of blood and flesh as a man in order to destroy Satan.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus also came as the Son of Man in order to seek and save lost humanity. Luke 19:10 says, &ldquo;The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.&rdquo; If the Lord Jesus had not become a man, He could not have become our Savior. God expresses Himself through man, God deals with His enemy through man, and God saves the lost through man.</p>
<p>The importance of humanity can also be seen in the type of the forty-eight standing boards of the tabernacle in the Old Testament. Every one of the forty-eight boards was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 26:15, 29). Each standing board was a product of two natures&mdash;wood within and gold without. The gold without was for the adornment of beauty and the increase of value. The acacia wood within was for the boards to stand. Bible readers know that gold signifies divinity and that wood signifies humanity. The Lord Jesus has both divinity and humanity; He is both God and man. He is a man who has become God&rsquo;s dwelling place. He can stand firmly in the universe and accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose because He is not only God with divinity but also man with humanity. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; Jesus Christ became flesh; He is the tabernacle of God among us. The standing boards of this tabernacle come from the humanity of Jesus. Jesus is God&rsquo;s dwelling place because of His humanity.</p>
<p>Of the five types of offerings in Leviticus in the Old Testament&mdash;including the burnt offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, and the meal offering&mdash;the meal offering consisted of fine flour mingled with oil (2:1, 4). In the New Testament the Lord revealed that He was a grain of wheat that would fall into the ground (John 12:24); the meal offering typifies the humanity of the Lord Jesus in His walk on the earth. The meal offering was the daily food for the priests who served in God&rsquo;s presence (Lev. 2:3, 10). Every day the priests ate the meal offering. This typifies our need to take Jesus as our food in our service to God. In other words, we need the humanity of Jesus in our service to God.</p>
<p>God wants to express Himself, and He will do so only through man. God wants to deal with Satan, and He will do so only through man. God wanted to accomplish redemption to save man, and He could do so only through man. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth depends upon humanity, and the humanity of Jesus is our food in our service to God.</p><h2 class="head1">DESIRING TO BE ANGELS AND TO GO TO HEAVEN<br />
BEING WRONG CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>Many Christians have the thought and desire to be like an angel. Perhaps even some sisters among us would like to be an angel. According to the Bible, the fall of man began when Satan seduced Eve and told her that she could become like God by eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 3:5). In doing so, Satan tempted man to leave his status as a man. Some religions are focused on the thought of pursuing and attaining immortality, but this is not God&rsquo;s desire. Buddhist monks and Taoist priests have all been deceived by Satan in this regard. God wants us to be men who express Him; He has no desire that we become like Buddhist monks, Taoist priests, or Catholic priests and nuns. God needs normal men.</p>
<p>Christianity also promotes the concept of going to heaven. This is a wrong concept. Many Christians believe that they will go to heaven when they die, but Satan is not afraid of men who think only of going to heaven. Satan is afraid of men who will be men of God on earth. While man dreams of going to heaven, God longs to come to the earth. Man hopes for heaven, but God&rsquo;s hopes are related to the earth. God is very interested in the earth, and He wants to gain the earth. When the Lord Jesus taught people to pray to the Father, He said, &ldquo;Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo; (Matt. 6:10). Many Christians have no desire to be on this earth with its sufferings. A person may have no regard for his parents, be dissatisfied with his wife, disappointed in his sons, and displeased with his daughters. Hence, when he looks at his situation and considers his misery on earth, he longs to go to heaven as a means of escape. But this longing, however, goes against the Lord&rsquo;s word: &ldquo;Your will be done...on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some have accused me of speaking heresy because I tell people that the New Jerusalem is not heaven or a place of heavenly mansions. When I say this, their concept of heaven is nullified. However, this is the word of the Bible; it is not a heresy. Revelation 21:2 says, &ldquo;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&rdquo; Man wants to go to heaven, but God wants to come down to the earth. We do not need to be angels or to dream of going to heaven.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD NEEDING MAN</h2>
<p>God does not need angels; He needs man. He not only needed man in order to accomplish redemption; He also needs man for the preaching of the gospel. God does not want angels to preach the gospel. When Cornelius was praying in Acts 10, an angel came and said to him, &ldquo;Send for a certain Simon, who is surnamed Peter&rdquo; (v. 5). If I were Cornelius, I would have asked the angel to preach the gospel to me directly. I would have seen no need to send for Peter. If I had spoken to the angel in this way, however, the angel would have said, &ldquo;I am sorry, but I am not a man. I am not qualified to preach the gospel; I can only relay messages. Peter is qualified to preach the gospel.&rdquo; This shows that an angel is not higher than a man. Would you rather be an angel or a man? I am almost seventy years old, but I do not feel that I have had sufficient time on the earth as a man. I have no desire to go to heaven; I would like to be on the earth as a man, expressing God and doing God&rsquo;s will, until the Lord Jesus comes again. Those who feel that being a man involves only a bland existence lack Jesus. When we experience Christ in us, however, nothing is bland; even our sufferings become full of meaning.</p>
<p>The Bible contains only the revelation of God, but Christianity contains many concepts that are based only on the traditions of men. Women often want to be nuns because they do not want to deal with the difficulties of a husband or the encumbrance of children. This allows them to be an &ldquo;angel,&rdquo; according to their concept. This is in contrast to the thought of God, who said, &ldquo;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it&rdquo; (Gen. 1:28).</p>
<p>We should ask ourselves whether we truly have a desire to be a man, because the true value of a man lies in our enjoyment of the Lord Jesus. Jesus is a man. Even though Jesus, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit, He still is a man with humanity. His humanity and His person are in this Spirit. The Lord Jesus was not only a man on the earth; He is still a man in heaven, and He will be a man throughout eternity. In John 1:51 the Lord said to Nathanael, &ldquo;You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo; Acts 7 records that when Stephen was being martyred, he saw the Lord as the Son of Man in heaven (v. 56). In eternity our Lord Jesus will still be the Son of Man. This is mysterious, and its depths cannot be exhausted in words.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is real and living. He possesses humanity in addition to divinity, and He dealt with Satan in His humanity. In His humanity He became our Savior and the dwelling place of God. Furthermore, His humanity has become our food. We need to eat Him, drink Him, and take Him into us so that His humanity becomes our humanity! The more a man has the Lord Jesus as his humanity, the more he appreciates his status as a man, especially as a man in relation to his parents, his wife, and his children. The more he lives as a man, the more he appreciates the meaning of being a man and the more he is a man. The more he is filled with the Lord Jesus, the more he experiences the reality of being a man because this second man is complete and perfect. This is possible because His humanity becomes our humanity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH BEING ONE NEW MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 10, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:14-16; 4:22-24; Col. 3:9b-11; Eph. 3:16-19</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Chapter 15 of 1 Corinthians reveals that Christ is the second man, who passed through death and resurrection, becoming the life-giving Spirit (vv. 45, 47) and entering into us to be our life. In this chapter we will consider the third man, the one new man. The third man in the Bible is the church, the corporate one new man. In Christianity few have seen that the church is a corporate man, and even fewer speak of the church in this regard. Although it is common for people to speak about &ldquo;going to church,&rdquo; as if the church were a building like a chapel, this is a low and erroneous concept. A chapel is something without life, but the church is living. The church as the Body of Christ is the highest and most spiritual aspect of the church in the Bible. Although there are other designations for the church, such as the called-out ones and the gathering of the called-out ones, these expressions are not as deep as the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The book of Ephesians shows that the church as the Body of Christ is a man. This is based on 2:14-15, which says, &ldquo;He Himself is our peace, He who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man.&rdquo; <em>Enmity</em> refers to the law of the commandments in ordinances, and <em>both</em> refers to Jewish and Gentile believers. Christ abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances on the cross, that is, the enmity between men, so that He might create both Jewish and Gentile believers in Himself into one new man. From these two groups, the Lord created one new man in Himself. This proves that the one new man is not an individual but a corporate man.</p>
<p>Verse 16 continues: &ldquo;And might reconcile both in one Body to God.&rdquo; Many know that the church is the Body, but few see that the church is one new man. However, verses 15 and 16 show that the one new man in verse 15 is the Body in verse 16, and that the Body in verse 16 is the one new man in verse 15. Chapter 1 speaks of the church as His Body (vv. 22-23), and verses 15 and 16 of chapter 2 show that this Body is one new man. Therefore, the church is not only the Body of Christ but also one new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON<br />
AND LETTING HIM MAKE HOME IN US</h2>
<p>There are distinctions between the Body and the one new man. Because there is life within the human body, our body is a part of us, but the life that we have is also related to a person. We have life, and we are a person. Although a tree is a living entity, we cannot say that a tree is a person. However, human beings are both living entities and persons. Within our body there is life, and within our human being there is a person. A person can experience pain, be angry, and cry out when he is hit by another person, but a tree does not experience pain, become angry, or cry out when it is hit. It has no sense of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy. Neither does it have a preference, a will, or a mind. We cannot say that it is not living, because its growth proves that it is alive. However, it has only life; it has no person. Human beings are different because a human being is also a person. Human beings can be angry, laugh, and think. Similarly, the church is more than the Body of Christ with Christ as its life; it is also the one new man with Christ as its person.</p>
<p>Christ is not only in us to be our life; He is in us to be our person. Hence, Ephesians 3:17 speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts. Making home is a matter related to being a person. When we buy a table and place it in our home, we do not say that the table has made its home in our home. However, if I come to live in your home, this would involve my making home in your home. A wooden table has no person, and consequently, it is unable to make home in our home. Even if it is a beautiful table, it will feel nothing if it is kicked. In contrast, I could live in your home and even make my home in your home because I am a person. Being a person is higher than simply having life. The church is not only the Body of Christ with Christ as its life; the church is also the one new man with Christ as its person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD WANTING A CORPORATE MAN</h2>
<p>When the first man failed, God came to be the second man, Jesus. With Him there was no failure related to God&rsquo;s purpose for man. Jesus expressed God, dealt with Satan, redeemed sinners, became the dwelling place of God, and even became food for us to serve God as priests. Even though He was successful in every way, He was an individual man in His human living. However, God wants a corporate man, not an individual man. Genesis 1:26 says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness, and let them...&rdquo; In Hebrew <em>man</em> is singular because God created one man, Adam. Although God created one man, the pronoun that refers to this one man in the verse is not the singular <em>him</em> but the plural <em>them.</em> How many men did God create? Acts 17:26 says, &ldquo;He made from one every nation of men.&rdquo; This shows that God originally created one man, not many; nevertheless, this man is a corporate man.</p>
<p>Adam is a corporate man; Adam&rsquo;s descendants were all included in him. If Adam had died of an accident on the second day of his creation, we would not be here. Adam was a corporate man, but the Lord Jesus was an individual man while He was on the earth. However, as a grain of wheat, He fell into the ground and died in order to bear much fruit (John 12:24). As a grain of wheat the Lord Jesus died and rose in resurrection to produce us as many grains. As many grains that have been blended together, we have become a corporate new man in Christ. Individuals cannot accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose; therefore, God wants a corporate man. God&rsquo;s purpose cannot be fulfilled in the Lord Jesus as just an individual. Therefore, He passed through death and resurrection in order to bring forth many grains to produce a corporate man in Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">EATING AND DRINKING THE LORD JESUS<br />
TO ENJOY THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>In Christ the church is a corporate man composed of all who are saved; hence, no believer can be an independent individual. The church life consists of members of the Body of Christ, not independent individuals. On the surface it seems as if we are complete persons and even independent individuals. For example, I can speak, and you can speak. I can walk, and you can walk. I can hear, and you can hear; whatever I can do, you can do as well. In the church life, however, we are members, each of whom has a respective function, and not all the members have the same function (Rom. 12:4). A hand is a member, an ear is a member, and an arm is also a member. The hand can do only what a hand can do. If it wants to walk, it must depend on the feet. So Brother Hand needs to say to the feet, &ldquo;Brothers, if you do not walk, I cannot move.&rdquo; Then Brother Foot may say, &ldquo;Brother Hand, if you do not take the bread, I cannot receive the supply.&rdquo; Brother Hand then may say, &ldquo;Brother Mouth, if you do not eat the bread, we still cannot receive the supply.&rdquo; Then Brother Mouth will say to the eyes, &ldquo;Sisters, we want to eat, but if you do not look, we will not be able to eat either.&rdquo; Every member needs the other members.</p>
<p>Since we are members, we cannot be individualistic. It is easy for sisters to be individualistic. When they are angry, for example, they only want to be left alone. When I was young, I was full of energy and wanted to do everything by myself. I am not this way now. The more a person grows in the Lord, the more he feels a need for the other members. Without other members, many things will be left undone. If I am a mouth, I can only eat and speak; for everything else, I must depend on others.</p>
<p>According to the human life and nature, we all have a need for community. Our nature produces a desire within us to live and have a community life with others. This is a need that God created within man. People flock together by nature and need to live a community life. It is part of human nature to want to live with others in a community. However, because Satan injected his corrupt nature into man through the fall, man has a difficult time getting along with others. It is very easy for us to be in conflict with others. This is possible even among believers. On the one hand, we recognize our need for the brothers and sisters and sense a sweetness when we are with them, but on the other hand, it is easy to judge and criticize them. We need the Lord. His humanity is the meal offering, which is seasoned with salt (Lev. 2:13); the &ldquo;germ-killing&rdquo; function of the salt acts as a &ldquo;spiritual antibiotic.&rdquo; The more we eat the Lord Jesus, the more the Lord kills our &ldquo;germs&rdquo; and removes the negative elements, such as bitterness.</p>
<p>Human beings need to live together in a social setting, but society is filled with all kinds of wickedness because of the corruption in our human nature. However, those of us who eat the Lord Jesus have the church, and in the church these evil &ldquo;germs&rdquo; are killed by the &ldquo;germ-killing&rdquo; element in the Lord Jesus as our meal offering. If we do not eat the Lord Jesus and do not pray-read the Word, we will have problems in the church. If those who live in the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses do not eat Jesus and pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, problems will quickly arise. When a brother and a sister are married, they should eat the Lord Jesus and pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word together. They must eat the Lord Jesus in order to live the married life. This will kill any &ldquo;germs.&rdquo; Since we live in a social setting but have been poisoned by the fall, we must enjoy Christ to let Christ kill the &ldquo;germs&rdquo; within us. Additionally, because the Lord Jesus&rsquo; life is not an individual life but a corporate life, the more we eat the Lord, the more we will desire to live with the brothers and sisters in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN<br />
AND PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s subtlety is to divide men, and he uses ordinances related to our living to accomplish this. Different nations and people have different ordinances related to their living. The greatest distinction in this regard is between Jews and Gentiles. The Jews have numerous dietary regulations that separate them from Gentiles. In addition to the Jews, however, every ethnic group has particular ordinances, and sometimes there are even different ordinances within an ethnic group. For example, in China there are great differences between southern and northern Chinese. The Chinese who live in the south like to eat rice-based foods, while those in the north like to eat wheat-based foods. Those who live in the south regard those who live in the north as barbarians, and those in the north also regard those who live in the south as barbarians. Americans also have different ordinances based on where they live. Those who live in the north look down upon those who live in Texas, and those who live in Texas do not like those who live in the north. Various ordinances related to living cause people to be divided, and it is the same with language. When someone from Foochow meets a fellow countryman abroad who speaks with a Foochow dialect, he has a sweet and friendly feeling toward him. Those who speak with a Shanghai dialect feel quite happy when they encounter someone who speaks the same dialect. In the end, those who speak with a Foochow dialect and those who speak with a Shanghai dialect form separate groups that are divided from other groups. Thus, ordinances related to living and language divide people.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2 tells us that on the cross the Lord Jesus abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances and broke down the middle wall of partition separating Jews and Gentiles, slaying the enmity. This enmity is equal to the ordinances. Because of Christ&rsquo;s work on the cross, there is no longer any distinction between Jews and Gentiles who have believed into Christ. Similarly, in Christ there are no distinctions between the Chinese who live in the south and those who live in the north and even between Chinese and Japanese. All the differences have been nailed to the cross. The cross has terminated every distinction based on nationality. In order to live the church life, we must see that the ordinances related to our natural living have been abolished on the cross. Since the enmity has been fully slain by the Lord, there should be no separation based on nationality or region, such as Americans or Chinese and southern or northern Chinese. Every separating ordinance has been nailed to the cross.</p>
<p>When the Lord abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances on the cross, He created in Himself one new man out of Jews and Gentiles, Americans and Chinese, and so forth. Today everything natural has been abolished in Him. Consequently, after speaking in chapter 2 of the one new man, verse 22 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;Put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man.&rdquo; We need to put off the old man, which is our former manner of life. All manners of life concern societies and communities. Without a community there is no manner of life; the more we have a social life, the more we will have a manner of life. By ourselves, we have no manner of life. For example, a person does not need to honor his parents if he has none, or rear children if he has none, or love his wife if he has none. Without a community life there is no need for a manner of life. Therefore, our manner of life is a matter of community.</p>
<p>To put off, as regards the former manner of life, the old man, is to put off our old social way of living. Formerly, we were part of a social group with whom we participated in unfit things. That was our old man, as regards our former manner of life. Now that we are saved, we have put off that manner of life. Verse 24 continues, saying, &ldquo;Put on the new man.&rdquo; The new man is the church life. We put on the church life by being fellow members with the brothers and sisters, by loving one another, and by singing and psalming with our heart to the Lord (5:19). To put off the old man and to put on the new man are to put off our former social and community living and to put on the church life, to live in the church life. When we live in the church life, we will have no desire to hold on to anything but the church life, and we would be empty and full of bitterness without the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING SATURATED AND FILLED WITH CHRIST<br />
UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2>
<p>The young people who live in brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses will always have some trouble living together because our human nature still exists, and it irritates others. Nevertheless, it is truly sweet when all are in spirit and enjoying the Lord together. Therefore, in order to put off the old man and to put on the new man, we need to eat Christ so that He can grow in us. Otherwise, our putting off will be painful rather than enjoyable. When parents discipline their children, it is always a painful matter to the children and even to the parents. Parents often are angry when discipline is needed, and children also resist the discipline of their parents. By eating Christ and letting Christ grow in us, we will spontaneously put off the old man and put on the new man. This is like the transformation of a silkworm into a butterfly. When a silkworm grows, the cocoon is spontaneously shed.</p>
<p>In the church we have to lead people to eat Christ. The more we eat Christ, the more He will make His home in our heart. Furthermore, Christ spontaneously becomes our person as our old manner of life is put off. It is useless to tell others to be humble and overcoming, but if we help them to eat and enjoy Christ, they will spontaneously experience these things. The way that the Lord leads us is practical as well as simple. We have heard many doctrines and tried many methods, but today the Lord has given us the simple way of eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord. The Lord is edible. He is in the Spirit, and He is in the Word. The Spirit is in us, and the Word is in our mouth. If we pray-read and digest the Lord&rsquo;s Word every day, the Lord will make His home in our hearts. Thus, the Lord will not only become our life but also our person. As a result, we will see the reality of all the saints being the one new man. We are a part of this new man, and we can apprehend what the breadth and length and height and depth are only with all the saints (3:18). The breadth and length and height and depth are the dimensions of the universe. Christ is the breadth, Christ is the length, Christ is the height, and Christ is the depth. The universe is limitless; no one can say clearly how broad the breadth is, how long the length is, how high the height is, and how deep the depth is. These signify Christ and His boundlessness. Christ is the breadth and length and height and depth of the universe. Even though He is immeasurable, He can be enjoyed by us. When we enjoy Him, we are filled unto all the fullness of God (v. 19), which is the expression of all God&rsquo;s riches.</p>
<p>Eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord cause us to be full of Christ, and this is the church. Our being in Adam, in the flesh, and even in our self, that is, in our prejudices, religious concepts, and natural thoughts, has been dealt with in Christ. Now Christ can saturate us to the point that we are filled unto all the fullness of God. This is the one new man, which is the reality of the church life. The one new man accomplishes God&rsquo;s purpose and will defeat God&rsquo;s enemy to bring in the kingdom and bring the Lord back so that we can reign together with Him. This is God&rsquo;s will, and this is the role of the third man&mdash;the church as the one new man&mdash;in the Bible.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE MAN-CHILD IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 11, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 12:1-5, 7-11; 19:1-9</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUR MEN IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The first three men that the Bible speaks of are Adam, the Lord Jesus, and the church as the one new man. The third man&mdash;the church&mdash;is a corporate man produced by the Lord Jesus through His death on the cross and through the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost after His resurrection. However, the church soon became desolate. God then began to call for overcomers, signified by the man-child in Revelation, to accomplish His purpose. The man-child is the fourth man spoken of in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSAL WOMAN</h2>
<p>The man-child in Revelation 12 is brought forth by a universal woman. Verses 1 through 5 say, &ldquo;A great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; and she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth. And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, there was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems...And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child. And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.&rdquo; Verse 1 says, &ldquo;A great sign was seen in heaven.&rdquo; Hence, the woman, the dragon, and the man-child in this vision are all signs.</p>
<p>Certain Scriptures are clear and can be interpreted literally. For example, the phrases <em>in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth</em> and <em>God so loved the world</em> (Gen. 1:1; John 3:16) are neither symbolic expressions nor signs. Rather, they are clear words that can be interpreted literally. However, other verses, which contain visions, symbols, and illustrations, cannot be interpreted literally but should be expounded according to their spiritual significance. For example, Matthew 25 says, &ldquo;At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins&rdquo; (v. 1). <em>Virgins</em> here does not refer to ten actual virgins; rather, it signifies a group of people. Matthew 13:24-25 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field. But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat.&rdquo; <em>Wheat</em> and <em>tares</em> are metaphorical expressions that refer to a group of people who are like wheat and to another group of people who are like tares. Based on this principle, the woman and the man-child in Revelation 12 need to be interpreted figuratively.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Woman Signifying All of God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>The woman in Revelation 12 is not an actual woman but a symbol with spiritual significance. Verse 1 speaks of the woman being &ldquo;clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.&rdquo; This gives us a view of the universe and shows that the woman represents a corporate woman in the universe. The word <em>universe</em> encompasses both time and space, involving all time both past and present and including all space, that is, all places. This woman, as a sign, refers to a group of people, encompassing all time and all places; therefore, she is a universal woman.</p>
<p>This universal woman is clothed with the sun, the moon is underneath her feet, and a crown of twelve stars is on her head, but who does she symbolize? The Bible speaks of the sun, the moon, and twelve stars together in the same context twice&mdash;once in Revelation and once in Genesis. In Genesis 37 Joseph dreamed of the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowing down to him (v. 9). From the context we can see clearly that the sun refers to his father, the moon to his mother, and the eleven stars to his brothers who, along with Joseph, add up to twelve stars. When the sun, the moon, and twelve stars are put together, they represent all of God&rsquo;s people. Hence, the woman in Revelation 12 symbolizes the totality of God&rsquo;s people. Everyone who is of God throughout the ages and throughout the earth is included in this woman.</p>
<p>The Bible often refers to people who are of God as females because, figuratively speaking, God is the unique male. Hence, those who belong to God are female. According to the flesh, I am a male, but before the Lord, I am a female. In Song of Songs in the Old Testament the Lord is spoken of as our Beloved, and we are His love (2:10). In the New Testament, the ten virgins in Matthew 25 refer to all those who are of the Lord. Ephesians 5 also speaks of the church as the wife of Christ (v. 25). Thus, we can see that the persons who belong to God in the Bible are designated as females. Therefore, the woman in Revelation 12 symbolizes those who are of the Lord throughout all the ages on the earth. This woman includes Adam, Abel, Enosh, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Elijah, Jeremiah, Zechariah, Peter, James, John, and you and me.</p><h2 class="head2">The Woman Bearing the Symbols of Three Ages</h2>
<p>This woman is clothed with the sun, and the moon is underneath her feet. Furthermore, there is a crown of twelve stars on her head. Each of these heavenly signs is associated with a part of the woman&mdash;her body is clothed with the sun, the moon is underneath her feet, and the twelve stars are on her head. Each of these parts signifies a specific age. <em>Sun</em> denotes the age of grace. Luke 1:78 says that the first coming of the Lord Jesus is like the rising sun visiting us from on high. <em>Stars</em> and <em>moon</em> denote the dark night of the Old Testament age before the coming of the Lord Jesus, which can be further divided into the age of the patriarchs and the age of the law. The age of the patriarchs is signified by the twelve stars, and the age of the law is signified by the moon. The age of the patriarchs is from Adam to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob until the giving of the law; the dispensation of the law begins with Moses and concludes with the coming of the Lord Jesus. In the age of the patriarchs, people were not under the principle of the law but under the principle of grace; hence, the stars are on top of the woman&rsquo;s head. The law was not God&rsquo;s original intention; hence, the moon, representing the law, is underneath the woman&rsquo;s feet. These three symbols&mdash;the sun, the moon, and the stars&mdash;tell us that this woman is composed of all the Lord&rsquo;s people in these three ages.</p>
<p>Some Bible expositors say that this woman is Mary, the mother of Jesus, but this understanding lacks thoughtfulness. Mary was an Israelite woman, and it would have been impossible for her to be represented by a universal woman who stands between the heavens and the earth, who is clothed with the sun, who has the moon underneath her feet, and who has a crown of twelve stars on her head. Mary is only a part of this woman. This woman is the aggregate of all those who belong to the Lord throughout the age of the patriarchs, the age of the law, and the age of grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MAN-CHILD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Man-child Being the Overcomers in the Church</h2>
<p>Revelation 12:4 says, &ldquo;The dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child.&rdquo; This dragon symbolizes the ancient serpent Satan who stands before the woman with the intention to devour the man-child whom she will bring forth (v. 5), not to destroy the woman. The woman and the man-child are one entity before the child is brought forth; therefore, the man-child is a part of the woman. In the Bible females signify the weaker part, and males signify the stronger part. Although the woman symbolizes that God&rsquo;s people are weak, the man-child who is brought forth by the woman symbolizes a stronger part within the woman. This strength is seen by the fact that the man-child will shepherd all the nations with an iron rod (v. 5). In speaking of the overcomers in the church in Thyatira, verses 26 and 27 of chapter 2 say, &ldquo;He who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod.&rdquo; A comparison of these verses with 12:5 proves that the man-child is composed of the overcomers in the church. Just as the man-child is a part of the woman, the overcomers are the stronger part of the church.</p>
<p>The first man created by God, Adam, failed to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose. Therefore, God Himself came to be the second man, the Lord Jesus, in order to accomplish His purpose. Through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the church as the one new man was produced. This is the third man in the Bible. However, shortly after being produced, the church became weak and was unable to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose. Hence, in Revelation the Lord called for overcomers to be the man-child in order to accomplish the work that the church has not been able to accomplish (2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21; 12:5).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Overcomers Caring Only for God&rsquo;s Purpose,<br />
Not for Their Own Enjoyment</h2>
<p>All the churches on the earth today are a part of the universal woman as the totality of God&rsquo;s people. However, not everyone among God&rsquo;s people is strong. Consequently, God needs to call overcomers to be the man-child to accomplish His purpose. The case of Gideon in Judges 6 and 7 is a type of God&rsquo;s call for overcomers. At that time the children of Israel were experiencing the oppression and attack of Midian; consequently, God called Gideon to lead the people into battle against Midian. Initially, more than thirty-two thousand Israelites responded to God&rsquo;s call and were willing to fight. God, however, felt that there were too many people, so He asked Gideon to proclaim, &ldquo;Whoever is afraid and trembling should return and depart from here&rdquo; (7:3). As a result, twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained. However, God still felt that there were too many, and He eventually selected only three hundred men who lapped water into their mouth with their hand (vv. 6-7). They were the overcomers, the man-child of that time. Thus, we see that the overcomers are a group of people who, by God&rsquo;s grace, do not care for their own enjoyment but for God&rsquo;s purpose and interest. This is the distinction between the overcomers and others: they care only for God&rsquo;s purpose, not for their own enjoyment, future, career, marriage, family, or security.</p><h2 class="head2">The Man-child Being Strong to War against Satan<br />
for the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>Matthew 22 says, &ldquo;Many are called but few are chosen&rdquo; (v. 14). There are many believers throughout the ages, but only a minority of them are the man-child. Furthermore, the book of Revelation shows that Satan&rsquo;s attention is not directed toward the woman but toward the man-child, whom he seeks to devour. This is the real situation today. Although Satan afflicts the church and deals with the church, his darts are always aimed at the strong, overcoming ones&mdash;the man-child&mdash;in the church. Whoever is strong in the church becomes a target of criticism, opposition, and even attack. Revelation 12:5-7 even speaks of there being war in heaven when the man-child is caught up to God and to His throne. The man-child will war for the kingdom of God and cast down Satan and his angels (vv. 7-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cause of the Man-child&rsquo;s Victory over Satan</h2>
<p>Revelation 12:11 says, &ldquo;They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death.&rdquo; <em>They</em> in this verse refers to the man-child, the brothers who overcame Satan. Verse 10 speaks of Satan accusing the brothers before our God day and night. The brothers, however, overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, because of the word of their testimony, and because they did not love their soul-life even unto death. We can overcome Satan because the blood of the Lamb has redeemed us, because of the word of our testimony, and because we do not love our soul-life, our self, even unto death. Concerning negative things, the man-child will cast down God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, from heaven. Concerning positive things, the man-child will bring in the kingdom of God. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ.&rdquo; The man-child casts down Satan and brings in the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Man-child Being the Bride in Revelation 19</h2>
<p>The man-child in chapter 12 of Revelation becomes the bride in chapter 19. The overcoming believers who constitute the man-child will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb (vv. 7-9). Not every saved person will attend this marriage dinner. This dinner, which lasts one thousand years, is only for the overcomers. All those who are saved will be in the New Jerusalem in eternity future, but not everyone will be part of the bride. Nor will everyone be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. We must be today&rsquo;s man-child, the overcomers, to be part of the bride in that day and to enjoy the marriage dinner of the Lamb. In the coming millennial kingdom the overcomers will eat and rejoice together with Christ, enjoy His presence and joy, and enter into the full enjoyment of Him for one thousand years.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Becoming the Man-child to Defeat the Enemy,<br />
Bring In the Kingdom, and Accomplish God&rsquo;s Purpose</h2>
<p>From Genesis to the end of Revelation God has a purpose, which must be accomplished through man. In this matter the first man, Adam, failed. Then the Lord Jesus became the second man to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose. Through His death and resurrection, the one new man was produced, which is the church as the third man. This new man should have been able to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose, but the church failed. Therefore, God came in to call out overcomers from the church. These overcomers are the man-child. Only the man-child, composed of overcoming saints, can defeat and cast down God&rsquo;s enemy, bring Christ back, bring in the kingdom of the Lord, and accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Wherever the overcomers go, Satan is cast down and Christ is brought in. Hence, the kingdom of God, in which Satan is defeated and Christ is expressed, is with the overcomers. These overcomers are the man-child, the fourth man in the Bible.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">KNOWING AND EXPERIENCING<br />
THE SPIRIT OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 8, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 4:24; Matt. 28:19; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; Prov. 20:27; Ezek. 36:26-27; John 3:6; Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">VERSES IN THE BIBLE CONCERNING<br />
THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND THE SPIRIT OF MAN</h2>
<p>In speaking of man, the Bible particularly emphasizes the spirit of man (Zech. 12:1). In this chapter we will focus on the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. The Bible speaks of the spirit of man as well as the Spirit of God. In Ezekiel 36:26 God said, &ldquo;I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you,&rdquo; and in verse 27 He said, &ldquo;I will put My Spirit within you.&rdquo; These verses speak of both a new spirit and the Spirit of God. On the one hand, God has given us a new spirit; on the other hand, God has put His Spirit within us.</p>
<p>Please note the sequence of these verses. They do not speak of God first putting His Spirit in us and then giving us a new spirit. This would invert the actual sequence, which begins with <em>a new spirit,</em> referring to our spirit that is a vessel to contain God. In order for something to be received, there must be a prepared, receiving vessel. Hence, verse 26 speaks of a new spirit, which is a prepared vessel to contain God, and then verse 27 speaks of God putting His Spirit into this vessel. Our spirit is a vessel to contain God&rsquo;s Spirit, just as a thermos bottle is a vessel to contain hot water. A thermos bottle must first be prepared so that hot water can be poured into it. These verses show that there are two aspects to spiritual experience&mdash;our spirit and God&rsquo;s Spirit. Our spirit is a vessel, and God&rsquo;s Spirit is the content. Our spirit is the container for God&rsquo;s Spirit.</p>
<p>John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; In this verse <em>Spirit</em> refers to God&rsquo;s Spirit, and <em>spirit</em> refers to our spirit. The divine Spirit begets the human spirit, and the human spirit is born of the divine Spirit. The Spirit begets our spirit. This shows another side to the relationship between God&rsquo;s Spirit and our spirit. When speaking of our spirit containing God&rsquo;s Spirit, Ezekiel 36 first mentions our spirit and then God&rsquo;s Spirit, but when speaking of God&rsquo;s Spirit begetting our spirit, John 3 first mentions God&rsquo;s Spirit and then our spirit. Ezekiel 36 speaks of our spirit being prepared to contain the Spirit, whereas John 3 speaks of the Spirit begetting, or enlivening, our prepared spirit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; Here again the divine Spirit and the human spirit are mentioned. On the one hand, God is Spirit; on the other hand, those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness. This involves two spirits. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; The witnessing of the divine Spirit is in our human spirit. This witnessing involves two spirits, not just the witnessing of the Spirit or the witnessing of our spirit. Rather, we know that we are children of God because the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. In the Bible there are four places that speak of both the human spirit and the divine Spirit in the same context: Ezekiel 36:26-27 speaks of our human spirit containing the divine Spirit; John 3:6 speaks of the divine Spirit begetting our human spirit; 4:24 speaks of worshipping God who is Spirit in our human spirit; and Romans 8:16 speaks of the divine Spirit witnessing with our human spirit. These verses all refer to the two spirits.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT LEARNING DOCTRINES OUTWARDLY<br />
BUT BEING BORN OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Christianity is full of traditional concepts that are altogether religious and natural. Although it is not our intention to focus on the shortcomings of Christianity, I have received a burden from the Lord to speak concerning the revelation of the Spirit and our human spirit. We should never follow traditional concepts or religious thoughts. When the Lord said, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (John 3:6), He was speaking to an old Pharisee named Nicodemus, who came to the Lord at night. He did not come during the day to be with the Lord, like the twelve apostles. In fact, there were no old men among the twelve apostles. Neither was Nicodemus mentioned as being among the one hundred and twenty who were praying in the upper room in Jerusalem (Acts 1:13-15). What is an old man? An old man is a person who is full of preconceptions. A person who is only twenty years old can be an &ldquo;old young man&rdquo; if he is full of preconceptions. In contrast, a person who is seventy years old can be a &ldquo;young old man&rdquo; if he has no preconceptions. Whether we are old or young does not depend on our age but on the number of concepts and prejudices that we hold on to. The more prejudices and concepts that we have, the older we are; the fewer prejudices and concepts that we have, the younger we are.</p>
<p>Nicodemus was old because he came to the Lord full of religious concepts and traditional thoughts. As soon as he saw the Lord, he said, &ldquo;Rabbi&rdquo; (John 3:2). No one told him that the Lord Jesus was a rabbi; this came from his traditional concepts and from the poison of his religious thoughts. John the Baptist did not say, &ldquo;Behold, the Rabbi,&rdquo; when he saw the Lord coming to him; he said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God&rdquo; (1:29). Furthermore, when John baptized the Lord, he beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven upon the Lord (v. 32). The testimony of John the Baptist was a testimony related to the Lord as the Lamb of God upon whom God&rsquo;s Spirit descended.</p>
<p>If Nicodemus had not had any preconceptions about the Lord, he would have come to the Lord and addressed Him as the Lamb of God. It would have been wonderful if he had spoken in this way, but instead, he addressed the Lord as Rabbi. Once he said, &ldquo;Rabbi,&rdquo; he exposed that he was fully under the influence of traditional concepts. If he had not had any traditional concepts, he would have heard the testimony of John the Baptist, and he would have spoken of the Lord as the Lamb of God with the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Nicodemus&rsquo;s concept that the Lord Jesus came from God to be a great teacher is still present in Christianity. According to this traditional concept, our greatest need is for teaching. Christianity specializes in seminaries in order to cultivate teachers. When Nicodemus, as an old religious man, addressed the Lord Jesus as Rabbi, the Lord did not argue with him. Instead, He answered, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you...that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (3:5-6). The Lord cares about the Spirit begetting spirit. This is not a matter for a rabbi or a teacher; neither is it related to teachings or doctrines.</p>
<p>It is not easy to know the spirit because the spirit is mysterious and abstract. The Chinese word for <em>prudent</em> contains the character for <em>spirit.</em> A person who is filled in spirit is prudent. If a person has no spirit, his words and actions will be awkward and clumsy. But if he is filled in spirit with the Spirit, he will be very prudent and keen.</p>
<p>Since the spirit is mysterious, many Christians do not see the matter of the spirit when they read the Bible. Although they repeatedly read the Bible, they find only doctrines, teachings, regulations, and creeds. It is easy to touch the trunk, branches, and fruit of an apple tree, but it is not easy to touch the life within the tree. The Bible is like a great apple tree&mdash;it is easy to touch its trunk, branches, and fruit, which are all outward, but it is not easy to touch the life within it. However, it is this life that is most precious. Similarly, we can touch the cover of a microphone, but it is not easy to touch the electricity that flows through the microphone. Even with a nice cover, a microphone is useless without electricity. The function of a microphone depends upon its ability to receive electricity. The Bible is like an apple tree with a trunk, branches, and fruit, yet the core of the Bible is a matter of the spirit. The Bible is a book on the spirit. Hence, we should not be like Nicodemus and follow his example in order to learn doctrines, considering the Lord Jesus merely to be a rabbi, a teacher. First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Today the Lord Jesus is a life-giving Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">SALVATION BEING A MATTER OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Even though some parents are not Christians, they tell their children that it is better to have some form of religion than to have none. Furthermore, they often recommend Christianity, based on their perception of its superior doctrines. They may even say, &ldquo;Although Confucius said, &lsquo;What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others,&rsquo; Jesus said, &lsquo;All that you wish men would do to you, so also you do to them&rsquo;&rdquo; (Matt. 7:12). Thus, they realize that Jesus&rsquo; teaching is superior, because Confucius spoke of not doing negative things toward others, while the Lord spoke of doing positive things toward others. If our parents said this to us, how should we respond? We could nod in agreement and say, &ldquo;Yes, even though Confucius taught concerning negative things, the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in regard to positive things was extraordinary.&rdquo; Or we could say, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus not only gave me superior teaching, but He also is the life-giving Spirit. The Lord Jesus is in me as the living Spirit, not as a doctrine or teaching.&rdquo; Then we could say, &ldquo;If a motor has only an instruction manual but no electricity, it has only outward teachings, but once electricity is transmitted into it, it will run. Likewise, without the Spirit of the Lord entering into me, no teaching has any impact. The Lord Jesus has entered into me, and He is living and powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to let our parents know that we have received not Christianity but the living Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit. The Lord Jesus is Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17); He is the Spirit in order to be our Savior. We love the Lord because He is the life-giving Spirit living in us, not because He is the founder of a religion. We even love our parents because Jesus is living in us and daily operating in us, not because we have received the teachings of Jesus. For example, when we are even slightly unhappy with our parents, the Lord Jesus bothers us inwardly.</p>
<p>There is a difference between religion and the Spirit. Our Savior is not a religion, nor is our salvation merely a matter of teaching. Our Savior is the life-giving Spirit. He is more than a rabbi with outward teachings; He is in us as our life. Nicodemus was concerned with religious teachings, but the Lord Jesus was focused on the Spirit when He said, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (John 3:6).</p>
<p>John 3 presents a man who is a teacher of others, and chapter 4 speaks of a disreputable Samaritan woman. Nevertheless, this woman also liked to talk about religion. When the Lord Jesus spoke of living water, she asked the Lord for this living water. However, the Lord responded by asking about her husband, saying, &ldquo;Go, call your husband and come here&rdquo; (v. 16). The Lord asked about her husband because the disreputable aspect of her life was related to her many husbands. She responded with a &ldquo;truthful&rdquo; lie to the Lord. She answered and said, &ldquo;I do not have a husband&rdquo; (v. 17). Although we can lie to others, we can never lie to the Lord Jesus. All our lies will be exposed by the Lord. When the Lord Jesus heard this, He said, &ldquo;You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). As soon as the Lord spoke truthfully about her condition, she changed the subject from her husband to religion and worship, saying, &ldquo;Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&rdquo; (vv. 19-20).</p>
<p>At first, the Samaritan woman spoke about whether or not worship was possible on a mountain and then whether worship needed to be in Jerusalem. She did not want to talk about her husband but about the matter of worship, and according to religious thought, worship is a matter of location and forms. In response, the Lord Jesus told her that worship is not a matter of location or forms, because &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness&rdquo; (v. 24). When the Lord spoke of God being Spirit, He was referring to the substance of God being Spirit, and since God is Spirit, we must worship in spirit.</p>
<p>Nicodemus discussed matters of doctrine with the Lord, and the Samaritan woman discussed matters of religion. Although people like to talk about doctrines and religion, the Lord always answers with the divine Spirit and our human spirit, that is, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. If we want to know God, who is Spirit, we must exercise our spirit. We have a spirit, and when our spirit is regenerated by God&rsquo;s Spirit, we can exercise our spirit to worship God. This is not a matter of doctrine or teaching but a matter of the Spirit and our spirit. God is Spirit, and we have a spirit. Our spirit needs to be regenerated by God&rsquo;s Spirit, and God needs our spirit to worship Him. When the Spirit begets our spirit, our spirit can worship God, who is Spirit.</p>
<p>No matter what we are doing today, we must be clear that everything will pass away. The only thing that will last forever is the Spirit and our spirit. Only the Spirit and our spirit matter, not religion, teachings, or doctrines.</p><h2 class="head1">BAPTIZING PEOPLE INTO THE NAME<br />
OF THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Many people think that the Gospel of Matthew is quite long and full of doctrines, such as the Lord&rsquo;s words in chapters 5, 6, and 7, which are known in Christianity as the Sermon on the Mount. However, in 28:19, after the Lord Jesus had spoken concerning so many &ldquo;doctrines&rdquo; and prophecies, He said to the disciples, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; <em>All the nations</em> refers to the people in every country of the world. For example, Japanese, Filipinos, Chinese, and Indonesians are included in &ldquo;all the nations.&rdquo; The Lord, however, did not charge the disciples to go and preach doctrines to the nations but rather to &ldquo;disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; We need to baptize the Japanese into Christ, the Filipinos into Christ, the Chinese into Christ, and the Indonesians into Christ, that is, into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit&mdash;the Triune God.</p>
<p>The Chinese Union Version translates this verse as, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them <em>in</em> the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Based on this understanding, Christianity carries out an outward work of baptism. For example, if four people believe in the Lord, a pastor will say, &ldquo;Dear church members, praise God for giving us four new members today. We hereby baptize them so that they may join the church. We baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Praise God, they were formerly Gentiles, but now they are church members.&rdquo; Actually, in verse 19, the word <em>in</em> should be translated &ldquo;into.&rdquo; Baptism does not merely involve the repetition of the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; rather, baptism involves putting a believer <em>into</em> the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>There is a story of a Catholic priest who was doing a missionary work in a South American country. One day he preached the gospel to a young native, who then believed. The priest baptized the young native by sprinkling him with water. After baptizing him, the priest changed the young native&rsquo;s name to James. James then nodded and said, &ldquo;Formerly I was So-and-so, but now I am James.&rdquo; Catholicism has a custom that forbids the eating of meat on Friday, but it allows for the eating of fish. One Friday James went hunting in the mountains. When he could not find fish, he shot a deer and brought it back to be cooked and eaten. While he was eating, the priest passed by his window, smelled the aroma, and went in to rebuke him, saying, &ldquo;Do you not know that today is Friday? You cannot eat meat. You should eat fish.&rdquo; James said, &ldquo;Yes, I know, but I could find only this deer. Just as you changed my name after sprinkling water on me, I sprinkled some water on this deer and named it fish. This is no longer a deer but a fish. I am eating fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This story shows that in much of Christianity baptism involves merely an outward act. However, this is not the Lord&rsquo;s view. He charged us to baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, that is, to baptize people into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is unrelated to asking people to join a &ldquo;church.&rdquo; When we preach the gospel and baptize people, I hope we understand that we are not just baptizing them with water but baptizing them into the Triune God. As the Triune God, the Father is the source and the Son is the expression, and when He enters into man, He is realized as the Spirit. When we baptize people, we are not baptizing them into water only but into the Triune God Himself, into the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Hence, baptism is not a practice that makes people members of a &ldquo;church.&rdquo; Rather, it is to put people into the Triune God. Today the Triune God is the Spirit; the Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the realization. He enters into us, and we enter into Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING CAUTIOUS OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS AND TONGUES</h2>
<p>Christians today generally lack knowledge and experience of the Spirit. In an incorrect way other Christians pursue so-called spiritual gifts and speaking in tongues. I am not opposed to speaking in tongues, neither am I disregarding the speaking in tongues that is genuine, but I have seen much so-called speaking in tongues that is just <em>&ldquo;di di da da,&rdquo;</em> involving only the speaking of nonsensical sounds. I know what I am speaking about because over thirty years ago in Beijing, I led people to speak in this way. In contrast, on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit who entered into men was full of power, and three thousand were saved. However, we cannot see this kind of result in the Pentecostal movement in Taiwan today. We can see the manifestation of power even less. In recent years the so-called Pentecostal movement on the island of Taiwan was led by a sister. She said that speaking in tongues did not need to be related to a language but merely to sounds from the tongue. Toward the end of her life, she contracted tongue cancer and could not utter any sound. Those around her prophesied that she would be healed and that there would be an unprecedented revival in Taiwan and around the world in 1965 and 1966. But to this day, Taiwan has not witnessed this &ldquo;unprecedented revival,&rdquo; and the sister was not healed. Even after she passed away, her followers prophesied that she would be resurrected, but in the end nothing happened after she was buried. We should be cautious about pursuing spiritual gifts and tongues.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>The Lord created the heavens and the earth. After His work of creation, He became incarnated in the flesh in order to enter into His creature and be united with man. Moreover, in the flesh He accomplished redemption on the cross and then was resurrected from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit. Today creation, incarnation, and redemption have all been accomplished. He is the life-giving Spirit, and when we call upon Him, He enters into us as the Spirit. The Bible says, &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rdquo; (Rom. 10:13). Salvation is more than having our sins forgiven and not going to hell; salvation is the Lord as the life-giving Spirit entering into us to be joined with us as one. The Lord&rsquo;s Word says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:17). We should all say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, we are one spirit with the Lord!&rdquo; If someone asks us whether we have received the Holy Spirit, we should say, &ldquo;I have not only received the Holy Spirit; I am one spirit with the Lord.&rdquo; This is the meaning of salvation.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on His church and His children to show us that we are one spirit with the Lord. We and the Lord, the Lord and we, have been joined as one spirit. This is too glorious. The Lord is the life-giving Spirit, and He is with our spirit every day. In our spirit, He, as the Spirit, witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. We are in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us. Our spirit and the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit, the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit and our spirit, have been joined as one. Everything depends on the Spirit and our spirit, not on religion, teachings, or gifts, such as tongues.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SIMPLE WAY TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 9, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:6; 1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:4-6</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD AND MAN<br />
AS REVEALED IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The content of the Bible is altogether a matter of the Spirit of God and our human spirit. God created man as a vessel so that He could enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and nature for His expression. Therefore, God created a human spirit within man as an organ to receive Him (Gen. 2:7; Zech. 12:1). However, because of the fall of man, the spirit of man was deadened (Gen. 3:3; Eph. 2:1). Later, human culture, religion, and various philosophies emerged so that man&rsquo;s thoughts and concepts deviated from God&rsquo;s intention, bringing in many complications within man.</p>
<p>The biblical revelation regarding the relationship between God and man is actually quite simple. God is Spirit (John 4:24), and He created man as a vessel to contain Him by creating a human spirit within man (Rom. 9:23-24). God created a spirit within man because He, as the divine Spirit, desires to enter into man&rsquo;s spirit to be his life and nature. This simple relationship, however, became quite complicated because the fall of man filled man&rsquo;s mind with many distractions so that he cannot clearly see that God is Spirit, that man is a vessel to contain God, and that the human spirit is an organ and a vessel to receive God. Man, however, can still cry out to God and call on His name so that God can enter into his human spirit to be his life. This is regeneration.</p>
<p>To be regenerated means to be born again, which is to gain another life, the life of God, in addition to man&rsquo;s original life. The original life we received is the human life, but the life we receive through regeneration is the life of God. The life of God is divine and eternal; it is God Himself, and it is also the Spirit of God. We cannot separate the life of God from God; neither can we separate the life of God from the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>God is Spirit, and the Spirit is the Spirit of life (8:2). When God&rsquo;s life enters into our spirit, we receive another life, and we are regenerated. Regeneration is the issue of our believing in the Lord Jesus. We were fallen sinners, but God was incarnated to be a man, the Lord Jesus. As our Savior, Jesus accomplished redemption for us on the cross. God became a man in order to bear our sins on the cross, solving the problem of our sins before God. Hence, in order to be regenerated, we must believe in the Lord Jesus, who died for us and who redeemed us from our sins on the cross. When we believe in Him, His redemption is applied to us, and we are forgiven because His precious blood washes us of all our iniquities before our righteous God. Following His redemptive death, Jesus was resurrected from the dead and became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). His death dealt with man&rsquo;s sins, and in His resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, He can enter into man to be his life through regeneration (1 Pet. 1:3). Man needs to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus so that his sins can be forgiven. Then he needs to open to the Lord and call upon Him so that He can enter man&rsquo;s spirit to be his life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE LIVING LORD</h2>
<p>We need to follow the living Lord after our regeneration. Consider an example of a brother who was a criminal before hearing the gospel and believing in the Lord Jesus. First, his sins have been forgiven because of the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross. Second, the Lord entered into him as the omnipresent life-giving Spirit when he called upon the Lord&rsquo;s name. Not only were his sins forgiven, but the Lord&rsquo;s life also entered into his spirit. However, even though he has been regenerated with the Lord&rsquo;s life, he can still be tempted by the devil to do evil things and to think indecent thoughts in his mind. Nevertheless, deep within his spirit, there is an indescribable feeling that troubles him when he is tempted. This is the operation of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of life, in him. After a man calls upon the name of the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit enters into him, and even though he can be tempted to do evil and improper things, he no longer feels comfortable within when he does such things. This is because the Lord is living within him.</p>
<p>Before they were saved, all Christians had a certain sense of comfort with their sinful behavior. However, after believing into the Lord and calling upon His name, there is an additional sense, a feeling, within them that is real, even though it is almost indescribable. Previously, some believers were expert liars who could easily tell clever lies and be inwardly pleased with themselves. However, once they called on the Lord Jesus and received the Lord, it was difficult for them to lie. Some enjoyed watching movies very much, but the same sense of enjoyment was no longer present when they went to a movie. Ever since they called on the Lord, the Lord within them troubles them and makes them uneasy, because He is living and has no desire to go to a movie. This troubling proves that there is another person with another life in them. This is the operation of the Lord Jesus within a genuine Christian. Jesus, as the living Spirit, has entered into us and become our life. We have been born of the Spirit. John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; Jesus, as the living Spirit, is operating in us and troubling us so that we would follow Him. This is the mark of a genuine Christian.</p>
<p>Being a Christian is a very simple matter of following the Lord who lives within us. The Lord is the life-giving Spirit. As He stirs up things within us, He causes us to deal with our sins. Hence, we need to thoroughly confess our sins; the more thorough and more specific our confession is, the better it is. The more we confess our sins, the more the Lord will give us a sense of our sins. Then the more we have a sense of our sins, the more we can confess our sins so that our inner being will be fully occupied and filled with Him. When we call on His name, saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; and confess our sins before Him, our sins will be dealt with, and our inner being will be occupied and saturated with the Lord little by little. Furthermore, we will spontaneously enjoy the Lord and sense His presence, sweetness, and riches. The Lord will become our life, power, light, and holiness. We need to daily experience the Lord in this way and be filled with Him.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING DISTRACTED BY DOCTRINES,<br />
ORDINANCES, PRACTICES, OR TONGUES</h2>
<p>Regrettably, there are many distractions in Christianity. Christianity has many doctrines that are seemingly good but in reality are distractions. Christianity also has many ordinances, practices, and rituals that have become a form of bondage and restriction. The Pentecostal movement rose up in Christianity at the end of the nineteenth century because Christianity was full of doctrines, empty teachings, rituals, and ordinances, all of which were without life. The appeal of the Pentecostal experience was a reaction against this deadness. This movement, however, eventually went to an extreme, emphasizing the matter of speaking in tongues and teaching that a believer must speak in tongues in order to receive the Holy Spirit, be filled with the Holy Spirit, and have an overcoming living.</p>
<p>The Bible does record experiences of speaking in tongues, and I do not oppose genuine tongue-speaking, but I do not believe that many of the experiences of so-called tongue-speakers today are genuine. Thirty-six years ago I was influenced by the Pentecostal movement, and I spoke in tongues repeatedly. I even helped others to speak in tongues. However, I realized very quickly that it was meaningless, and I abandoned it. I have spent much time to study the matter of speaking in tongues and am confident that much of the current practice of speaking in tongues is false.</p>
<p>Tongues in the Bible refer to a dialect, either angelic or human; however, many so-called tongue-speakers have reduced this to the repeated use of a few sounds. But what dialect only relies on a few sounds? The tongues spoken of in the Bible involved much more than repeating &ldquo;<em>di di da da.</em>&rdquo; Many who promote this practice are deceiving God&rsquo;s children. Some even teach that a person who does not speak in tongues is not saved. Others teach that it is possible to be saved without speaking in tongues but that it is not possible to receive the Holy Spirit without at least some &ldquo;<em>di di da da</em>&rdquo; experience of speaking in tongues. Both teachings are absolutely wrong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MANY SPIRITUAL MEN BEING<br />
AGAINST SPEAKING IN TONGUES</h2>
<p>All over the world today, wherever there are Christians, there are people who have been helped by the books of Brother Watchman Nee. However, Brother Nee never spoke in tongues. Not only did he never speak in tongues; he was the first among Chinese Christians to tell people it was a doctrinal error to say that one must speak in tongues in order to receive the Holy Spirit. When I first arrived in Tientsin and Beijing to work in these two cities in 1936, I went to learn about speaking in tongues and to lead others to speak in tongues. When Brother Nee heard about this in Shanghai, he immediately sent me a telegram with the words of 1 Corinthians 12:30: &ldquo;Do all speak in tongues?&rdquo; He did not speak in tongues, and he did not believe that all Christians needed to speak in tongues. Brother John Sung, who was the most powerful evangelist among Christians in China thirty years ago and who brought many to salvation, opposed this even more. If he saw anyone uttering &ldquo;<em>di di da da</em>&rdquo; sounds, he would say that it was of the devil. He was altogether against this so-called Pentecostal experience.</p>
<p>Over the past few centuries, many servants who were greatly used by the Lord never spoke in tongues. Charles Spurgeon and D. L. Moody were both influential preachers in the nineteenth century, but they never spoke in tongues. Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis, who was considered to be a very spiritual person in the twentieth century, also was against such Pentecostal pursuits. She believed that in the Pentecostal movement there were many counterfeits from Satan and cases of demon possession. Andrew Murray was also a very spiritual man. He never spoke in tongues and did not encourage people to speak in tongues. The teaching that one cannot be saved without speaking in tongues or cannot receive the Holy Spirit without speaking in tongues is absolutely a satanic heresy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CASES OF COUNTERFEIT TONGUE-SPEAKING</h2>
<p>In 1963 I was invited by a Pentecostal group to lead a conference in San Diego for a week. When I arrived at the meeting place, I saw a sign advertising my name. Immediately, I asked them to take it down, or I could not speak. They took down the sign, and after speaking in the meeting, I stayed in the house of one of the leading ones, along with an American brother and two Chinese brothers and a sister. One night after the meeting was dismissed, we returned to his house, and I went to bed early. Then the host began to speak with the two Chinese brothers about tongues. He and his wife laid hands on them and told them to quickly and repeatedly say Hallelujah in order to speak in tongues. These two brothers were honest and could not pretend to speak in tongues. Nevertheless, the couple was so persistent that eventually one brother said to the other in Chinese that unless he babbled something, the couple would not let them go. The wife of one of the Chinese brothers was Indonesian, and so he uttered a few sentences in Indonesian. When the American couple heard this, they cheerfully applauded and proclaimed that he had spoken in tongues. The next morning the two brothers recounted how they were pressed to speak in tongues. When I heard this, I spoke to the brother who gave us hospitality, saying, &ldquo;Brother, why did you have to do this? Is the Lord Jesus not enough for you to preach? Is Christ not enough for you to supply? Why do you need to engage in such things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I was living near Los Angeles in 1963, a physics professor in his forties invited me to dinner in his home, and several others came with me. During dinner he testified how he was blessed to be able speak in tongues by just wagging his tongue and making sounds. As soon as he said this, I stopped him, saying, &ldquo;The Bible has no definite record that Peter and all the one hundred and twenty disciples spoke in tongues on the day of Pentecost. Furthermore, if the tongues they spoke at the time were just sounds made by wagging their tongues, then the tongues they spoke were not supernatural but merely manufactured. In the Old Testament Balaam&rsquo;s donkey spoke in a genuine human language. Tongue-speaking involves a supernatural power, that is, the power of the Holy Spirit coming upon you. There is no need to wag your tongue. If you need to wag your tongue, you are faking tongues.&rdquo; He had a doctorate in physics, and after hearing my analysis, he said nothing further.</p>
<p>Genuine tongue-speaking is produced by the Holy Spirit coming upon a person, but where is the power of the so-called tongue-speakers who make &ldquo;<em>di di da da</em>&rdquo; sounds today? Such ones also speak many prophecies, but none of them are ever fulfilled. A prophetess among some Pentecostals in Taiwan predicted that there would be a great revival throughout the whole world in 1966 and especially in Taiwan. Eventually, nothing happened. Some so-called Pentecostals on the West Coast of the United States repeatedly prophesied that there would be great earthquakes in Los Angeles and that the entire city would sink to the bottom of the sea. They even warned people to leave Los Angeles and live in mountain caves. These prophecies also were not fulfilled. When their prophecies did not come true, their movement declined on the West Coast.</p>
<p>Through our study, we discovered that their prophecies all had the same intonation, whether in Chinese, English, or any other language. There was even a so-called school for prophets on the West Coast that specialized in teaching people how to prophesy. Their prophecies were mainly extracted from the books of Isaiah and Jeremiah. Our study confirmed that this has been a great bothering to God&rsquo;s children. Over the past seven years, the churches among us in Southeast Asia and Taiwan have also been distracted very much by this movement. We need to issue a warning to God&rsquo;s people not to listen to these counterfeits from Satan.</p><h2 class="head1">RETURNING TO THE PROPER SCRIPTURAL WAY&mdash;<br />
CALLING ON THE LORD<br />
AND ENJOYING THE LORD IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We should return to the pure word of the Scriptures. In God&rsquo;s redemption, the Lord Jesus is God becoming man. He was crucified for our sins and accomplished redemption. Then He resurrected from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit. On the day of Pentecost, He poured out the Holy Spirit upon the Jewish believers and later upon the Gentile believers in the house of Cornelius. In this way He baptized the whole church in the Holy Spirit. This fact was accomplished before we were born. We must remember that there is no factor of time in God&rsquo;s redemption. For example, the Lord&rsquo;s death for us on the cross took place before we were born. And our crucifixion with the Lord Jesus Christ took place before we were born. In the same principle, on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius, the Lord Jesus baptized His whole Body, both Jews and Gentiles, in the Holy Spirit. This was accomplished before we were born.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; This verse says that all who have believed, whether Jews or Greeks, have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body. We were baptized in the Spirit before we were born. Our baptism in the Spirit has been accomplished. The Lord Jesus has died for us, and we have been crucified with Him. When we believed into Him, our sins were forgiven, and when we called on Him, His Spirit entered into us, regenerating us and making us members of His Body. When we believe and call upon His name, He enters into us. If we daily call on Him, we will enjoy Him daily.</p>
<p>We should not pay attention to doctrines, teachings, or rituals but to our living Lord, who is the life-giving Spirit. He died for us, and now He lives in us. We need only to open to Him by exercising our spirit and by using our mouth to breathe Him in as our life, power, light, and holiness. Doctrines are useless, teachings are useless, rituals and ordinances are useless, and speaking in tongues and predictions are even more useless. There is only one way that is true, spiritual, and of life: We need to believe into the Lord Jesus, who was God incarnated as a man, who died for us on the cross, who was resurrected from the dead, and who became the life-giving Spirit. When we believe into Him, our sins fall away. Moreover, we need to exercise our spirit to call on His name. The more we call on Him, the more He will fill us from within to occupy and saturate our inner being and to transform us. When we call on Him and enjoy Him, letting Him fill and occupy us every day, He will become our life, power, light, and holiness.</p>
<p>The way is so simple and practical. Therefore, the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit&rdquo; (Gal. 5:25). Our every action must be by the Spirit and according to the Spirit, and our mind must be set on the spirit. The mind set on the spirit is life and peace (Rom. 8:6). However, we have been distracted by many doctrines, rituals, ordinances, and the like, as well as disturbed by the so-called Pentecostal movement and speaking in tongues. Now we are clear that the simple way to open ourselves and to exercise our spirit is to contact the Lord by calling on His name and by pray-reading His Word. At the same time, we need to follow the leading of His Spirit and confess our sins so that our inner being can be completely occupied, saturated, and transformed by Him. Then we can enjoy Him again and again to be filled with His riches.</p>
<p>Our daily life must be in spirit, and our church life must also be in spirit. We are being built up together into one Body in spirit. Likewise, being an overcomer and being prepared as the bride are matters of the spirit. We should have a daily life in spirit. May the Lord have mercy on us so that our eyes may be opened to live in the spirit and be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s all-inclusive Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">ENJOYING AND EXPERIENCING<br />
THE RICHES OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 10, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:13; 2 Cor. 1:21-22; 5:5; Eph. 1:13-14; 4:30</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR UNIQUE SYMBOLS<br />
RELATED TO OUR EXPERIENCE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>There are four verses in the Bible that contain four unique symbols of the Spirit, all of which are related to our experience of the Spirit. The first symbol is water. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; We have all been given to drink of the Spirit. The Spirit is water to us, and we need to drink Him. Hence, water is the first symbol that speaks of our realization of the Spirit in our experience. The second symbol is ointment, the anointing oil. Second Corinthians 1:21 and 22 speak of our being firmly attached unto Christ and being anointed. The word <em>anointed</em> indicates that the Spirit is like ointment, the anointing oil, and that God has anointed us with the Spirit, having sealed us and having given us the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts. Verse 22, which says, &ldquo;He who has also sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge,&rdquo; also points to the third and fourth symbols, which are the Spirit as a seal and as a pledge. God has sealed us with the Spirit. The Spirit is not only like ointment but also like a seal. The Chinese usually have a seal that represents who they are as a person. Similarly, God has a seal, which is the Spirit, and He sealed us with His Spirit. The fourth symbol, the pledge, is also spoken of in verse 5 of chapter 5. This verse says, &ldquo;Now He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the Spirit as a pledge.&rdquo; A pledge is a security, a guarantee. The Spirit is in us as a guarantee that God is our portion. Therefore, the Spirit we have received is like water, ointment, a seal, and a pledge.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING ATTACHED US WITH THE ANOINTED ONE</h2>
<p>Verse 21 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.&rdquo; This refers to the attaching of the apostles with the believers unto Christ, the anointed One. The word <em>Christ</em> in Greek has the same meaning as <em>Messiah</em> in Hebrew. In John 1:41 Andrew found his brother Simon and said to him, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah (which translated means Christ).&rdquo; <em>Messiah</em> in Hebrew is translated as &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; in Greek, and it means &ldquo;the anointed,&rdquo; the One appointed by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose, God&rsquo;s eternal plan. Hence, both <em>Messiah</em> and <em>Christ</em> mean &ldquo;the anointed.&rdquo; The anointed One is the Lord Jesus whom God has anointed with the Spirit. In Luke 4:18 the Lord said, &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus is God&rsquo;s Anointed. God has poured out His Spirit upon the Lord, anointing Him with the Spirit; therefore, the Lord Jesus is the Anointed.</p>
<p>God has firmly attached the apostles with the believers unto Christ, the anointed One. God&rsquo;s anointing oil is altogether on Him, and this anointing oil has further been poured out upon the apostles and the believers. God&rsquo;s anointing oil has been poured out on Christ, and He has firmly attached the believers to Christ so that the anointing oil on Him now flows onto us.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:27 says, &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; This verse can also be translated, &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into the anointed One have put on the anointed One.&rdquo; God has baptized us into Christ, which equals baptizing us into the anointed One. Consequently, we have put on the anointed One. God has firmly attached the apostles with the believers unto the anointed One; thus, all the anointing oil on Him flows onto the apostles and the believers.</p>
<p>Although the Bible says that we have been firmly attached to the anointed One, it often does not seem as if there is any anointing oil upon us. At such times, it is easy to have little or no faith. Nevertheless, the Bible says that those who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. Consequently, those who have been baptized into the anointed One have put on the anointed One. God has firmly attached us to the anointed One; therefore, God&rsquo;s anointing is our portion. This is clearly experiential.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE RICHES OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Breathing the Name of the Lord<br />
Being to Drink of the Life of the Lord</h2>
<p>Now we need to see how to enjoy the riches of the Spirit. Since the Spirit is likened to water, we need to drink of this Spirit and even drink in this Spirit. We have received an all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit is likened to water, and we have all been given to drink of this one Spirit. For many years I knew that I needed to drink the Spirit, but I did not know how to drink. Now I know that the only way to drink is to breathe in the Lord by calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; When we call on the Lord, we are breathing in the Lord, and our breathing is our drinking.</p>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #73 speaks of breathing the name of Jesus and of drinking of life. Watchman Nee received great help from the author of this hymn, Miss M. E. Barber. The second stanza of the hymn says, &ldquo;Blessed Jesus! Mighty Savior! / In Thy Name is all I need; / Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed.&rdquo; Miss Barber was quite experienced in the Lord, and she discovered that to breathe the name of the Lord is to drink of the Lord&rsquo;s life. Just to breathe the name of Jesus is to drink of life indeed. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; we are breathing, and our breathing is our drinking. Hence, we can drink the Lord by calling on His name.</p>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #255, which was written by A. B. Simpson, who founded the Christian and Missionary Alliance in America, also speaks of breathing the Lord. Brother Simpson was raised up by the Lord in the mid-nineteenth century and served the Lord first in Canada and later in the United States. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Pentecostal movement was quite prevailing in the United States, and Brother Simpson was also involved in it. However, when the Pentecostals went to the extreme of saying that speaking in tongues was a requirement for receiving the Holy Spirit, Brother Simpson did not approve.</p>
<p>We have at least ten hymns in our hymnal that were written by A. B. Simpson, such as, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #482), &ldquo;Once it was the blessing, / Now it is the Lord&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #513), and &ldquo;Jesus only is our message&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #511). <em>Hymns,</em> #255 speaks of breathing the Lord in stanza 7, saying, &ldquo;I am breathing every moment, / Drawing all my life from Thee; / Breath by breath I live upon Thee, / Lord, Thy Spirit breathe in me.&rdquo; The experience of this hymn is very rich; the author was breathing continuously, drawing his life from the Lord. Although many of God&rsquo;s children have gone astray, there is a practical, simple, convenient, and proper way to breathe in and receive the Lord&rsquo;s life every moment.</p>
<p>If the sisters would continually call on the Lord as they are taking care of household duties, they would breathe out their temper and concerns and breathe in the heavenly air. This heavenly air is the Lord Jesus. Brother Simpson was full of experience. He said, &ldquo;I am breathing out my sin.&rdquo; When he called &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; sin was breathed out from within him. Then he would breathe in more of the Lord&rsquo;s riches so that breath by breath the Lord was manifested through him. This is truly a good hymn. I once introduced it to an American preacher who had been preaching for twenty-five years. When I introduced this hymn to him, he did not approve of it; he believed that it was quite strange. Several years later, however, he told me that this hymn was the best and most spiritual hymn, because it is not doctrinal. It was written by a person who was involved in the Pentecostal movement but who also was concerned that speaking in tongues was being overemphasized. Even though we emphasize the experience of the Spirit, we should not take the way of speaking in tongues or of foretelling but the way of breathing in the Lord by calling on His name. This is the proper way.</p>
<p>Recently, some opposers said that calling on the Lord is good for new believers but that there is no need to call once a believer has grown. This is indeed nonsense. If my parents were alive today, I would still address them as father and mother. There is no graduation from calling on the Lord, because we always need to breathe. Since calling on the name of the Lord is breathing, we should not say that there is no need to breathe simply because we are grown up. No matter how old a person is, he still needs to breathe in order to live. We can graduate from many things, but we cannot graduate from breathing. Hence, we should not say that breathing is something only for &ldquo;children&rdquo; but not for &ldquo;adults.&rdquo; We will call upon the name of the Lord for eternity. Even in the New Jerusalem in eternity future, we will be calling upon the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 13:11 says, &ldquo;When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; since I have become a man, I have done away with childish things.&rdquo; Speaking in tongues keeps us in a childish stage, but in the coming age the matured believers will grow up, and these childish gifts, especially the lesser gifts, such as prophecies and speaking in tongues, will be rendered useless and cease (v. 8). However, calling on the name of the Lord is a matter for eternity. The way for us to enjoy the Lord is to call upon His name; therefore, we should never forsake calling upon His name. Many of us can testify that if we were not allowed to call upon the name of the Lord, it would be very distressing to us. Calling upon the name of the Lord is a spontaneous life practice in our Christian living. I call upon Him every day, even when I am getting dressed, tying my tie, combing my hair, and walking or riding in a car. I call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; and it is so sweet.</p><h2 class="head2">Receiving the Anointing</h2>
<p>God also has anointed us with the Spirit as ointment. This ointment, which is God Himself, anoints God&rsquo;s element and essence into us. Consider the application of paint. When I paint a wooden table, I spread the element of paint onto the table, and the element of paint is manifested. When God anoints us, He anoints us with Himself as the anointing oil. The more He anoints and paints us, the more He anoints His element and essence into us. With each application of paint on the table, the table gains an additional element of the paint. Hence, calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; is not a small matter. We need to realize that when we call, we are not only breathing and drinking in the Lord, but we are also letting the Lord anoint us and paint us. This anointing anoints the essence and element of God into us. Once an unbeliever is saved and begins to call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; the element and essence of God will be anointed into him, and after a few years he will be a different person.</p>
<p>Because we have all called upon the name of the Lord, I believe that we have the full assurance that the element and essence of God have been anointed into us. Additionally, because we call on the Lord every day, the element of God that has been anointed into us far exceeds our previous experience of touching and receiving the Lord. The more we call on the Lord, the more the element of God will increase in us.</p>
<p>God has anointed us. This is not a theological teaching. Theology usually stresses that God is unique, that He created the heavens and the earth, that we need to repent for our sins, and that we should fear God and honor our parents. Learning these theological teachings, however, does not mean that we have been anointed inwardly with the element and essence of God. We may have learned a doctrine about fearing God and honoring our parents, but we still have a desire to watch movies in the theater. If we call on the Lord Jesus but still go to a movie from time to time, something within us will not be peaceful, and there will even be a sense of regret within us. This sense is not related to doctrinal knowledge in our mind but to the living element of our Lord that has been anointed into our being. This element cannot be reconciled with the environment of a movie theater; this element is holy and separate. This is the reason that we have no inward peace when we are watching a movie; we may even feel inwardly unclean. We may not like to hear a word such as this, but God does, and so do those who love the Lord. We have an anointing within us that anoints us with the element and essence of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Experiencing the Sealing and the Pledging<br />
to Be Firmly Attached to the Anointed One</h2>
<p>God has also sealed us with the Spirit as a seal. This seal is not only an imprint; it is God Himself. My Bible is stamped with a seal bearing my name, and this imprint proves that the Bible is mine. Anyone who picks up my Bible cannot keep it as his own. Furthermore, the image of the seal on my Bible is the same shape of the imprinting seal in my pouch. God has sealed us with the Spirit so that we not only belong to Him, but we also bear His image. God has stamped us with the Holy Spirit, and now we bear His image. We belong to the Lord; we have the image of God. Although we dare not claim to be absolutely different from worldly people, there is something different about us, whether we are at a train station, at our work place, at our school, or at any other place. This is because the Lord is being manifested through us. Once our inward parts are filled with the Lord, it is difficult not to express the Lord outwardly. When our whole being bears the Lord&rsquo;s seal, we do not need to wear a sign that says we are Christians. Simply by calling, &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; our difference is manifested.</p>
<p>I often welcome visiting saints at airports or at train stations, many of whom I do not know. However, it is not difficult for me to tell them apart from other passengers. We truly are different from the worldly people. When we call upon the Lord daily and hourly, the Spirit as the divine seal is stamped upon us. When the Spirit is applied to us as a seal, our expression of God&rsquo;s image proves that we belong to God.</p>
<p>In addition, the Spirit is a pledge to us. The word <em>pledge</em> implies many things in Greek, including the thought of security, guarantee, warranty, foretaste, and sample. When a person buys oranges at a fruit market, he is often given an orange slice to prove their sweetness. This slice is a sample and a guarantee that all the oranges he buys will be as sweet. Hence, the slice is a guarantee, a warranty. The Spirit being in us is a foretaste, sample, guarantee, and pledge that the God whom we will enjoy in the future is the One we are tasting today. Therefore, the Spirit is a foretaste. Every cook in a kitchen has the advantage of tasting every savory dish that is being prepared. The enjoyment in the kitchen is a foretaste; the eating at the table is the full enjoyment. We have been given the Lord as a foretaste, which assures us that the coming full taste will not only be the same but also fuller. This pledge is not only meant to assure and guarantee our coming full taste; it is also for our enjoyment today.</p>
<p>Today we can drink of the Spirit. Today we can be anointed with the element of God. Today we can be sealed with God and bear the image of God, and today we can enjoy God as a sample, a foretaste, and a guarantee. These experiences are not doctrines. When we experience drinking of this Spirit, being anointed with this Spirit, being sealed with this Spirit, and receiving this Spirit as a pledge, we will realize that God has firmly attached us to the anointed One&mdash;Jesus Christ. He is God&rsquo;s anointed One, in whom are all the spiritual riches. He is everything, and we are firmly attached to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT SEEKING EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCES<br />
BUT TAKING THE WAY OF LIFE</h2>
<p>We should never be distracted to think that we need to speak in tongues, using sounds like &ldquo;<em>di di da da.</em>&rdquo; When we simply open our being to Him from deep within, contact Him, and call, &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; He will be real and living in us. We need to give Him a thoroughfare in our being and not say, &ldquo;This is a dead end.&rdquo; No matter how He operates, we need to give Him a thoroughfare in our being. He wants to enter into our thoughts, so we should say, &ldquo;Welcome, Lord.&rdquo; We should not shut off His entrance into our thoughts. He wants to enter our emotions, so we should say, &ldquo;Welcome, Lord.&rdquo; He wants to examine our conscience, so we should say, &ldquo;You are even more welcome.&rdquo; If He says that something is not right, we should say Amen. If He says that we need to deal with something, we should say, &ldquo;This is wonderful.&rdquo; We need to cooperate with Him and let Him occupy us from within and saturate our entire being. Then we will be full of living water and covered with the anointing oil, and we will have a seal and a pledge of full enjoyment in our being. By being firmly attached to the anointed One in our spirit, we will enjoy all that He is.</p>
<p>There is no need to seek for extraordinary experiences, even though God may give us some. I had several dreams in 1934 involving threatening circumstances. Later I went through an exceedingly great trial. During this trial I was reminded of my dreams, and then I understood that God had given me these dreams so that I would be comforted with the realization that my life would be preserved during my trial. Even if we have some extraordinary experiences, we should not seek for them. We should not seek odd things but take the proper way to live a normal life by knowing the Lord as the life-giving Spirit, who is water, ointment, a seal, and a pledge to us. We have a spirit to contact Him. We can enjoy Him when we open our whole being to contact Him moment by moment, call on His name, and pray-read His Word. If we provide Him with a thoroughfare in our being, He will be able to spread, saturate, and gain our whole being, and we will grow in Him and enjoy His riches. Then we will live in the church life. The Lord&rsquo;s leading in His recovery is for the churches to take the proper way of life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT<br />
AND WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 11, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:19-21a; 4:23; 2 Tim. 1:7; Rom. 1:9; 12:11; 1 Cor. 2:4; 5:3-4; 16:18; 2 Cor. 12:18b; Rev. 1:10; 21:10; Eph. 2:22</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GRACE OF THE LORD BEING THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY<br />
OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Our Lord is the God who created all things and who came in the flesh, passed through human living, died, and became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection. All His accomplishments are in this Spirit. In other words, as the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit includes God, God becoming flesh, human living, crucifixion, the effectiveness of crucifixion, as well as resurrection, ascension, and glorification. Every positive element is included in this all-inclusive Spirit. The Lord Jesus whom we believe in, follow, love, serve, and enjoy is the Spirit.</p>
<p>As water, He quenches our thirst. As ointment, He anoints His element and essence into us; as the seal, He seals us in His image to be like Him; and as the pledge, He is our enjoyment and the foretaste of our enjoyment of Him in the future. This is the Lord Jesus who lives in us today.</p>
<p>Philippians 1:19 speaks of &ldquo;the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In Greek the term <em>bountiful supply</em> implies an all-inclusive supply. Among the ancient Greeks, there were musical choruses in which a choragus, a leader or director, was responsible to provide for all the needs of the chorus, whether it was food, clothing, lodging, or transportation. He even supplied the musical instruments for their performances. If someone needed clothing, the choragus would supply him with clothing; if someone needed food, the choragus would supply him with food; if someone needed sleep, the choragus would supply him with a place to sleep. The choragus was responsible for supplying every need of the chorus. The term <em>bountiful supply</em> in Greek refers to the supply of a choragus. Paul used this term to refer to the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ in us. Whatever we need, He supplies. If we have sin and need forgiveness, He supplies forgiveness. If we are weak and need power, He supplies power. If we are in darkness and need light, He supplies light. If we are foolish and need wisdom, He supplies wisdom. If we are afflicted and need comfort, He supplies comfort. Whatever we need, He supplies. The supply that He inwardly gives to us is bountiful, all-sufficient, and all-inclusive.</p>
<p>We can magnify Christ in our bodies because we have this supply. Since we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit in us, we can magnify Christ in our bodies in any situation, whether good or bad, life or death, joy or sorrow, rich or poor. If we want to cross over a &ldquo;sea,&rdquo; He is our &ldquo;boat.&rdquo; If we want to ascend to the heights, He is our &ldquo;airplane.&rdquo; We do not need to fear anything, because He is everything, and He supplies everything that we need so that we can magnify Him. Eventually, we will say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (v. 21a). If we have not experienced this all-sufficient and all-inclusive Spirit, we will not be able to say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; We must experience this all-sufficient Spirit and enjoy His bountiful supply. Then we will say, &ldquo;As always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death. For to me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (vv. 20-21a).</p>
<p>The last verse of Philippians says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit&rdquo; (4:23). <em>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ</em> in chapter 4 is equal to <em>the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</em> in chapter 1. Philippians begins by speaking of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ and ends by speaking of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. This indicates that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The bountiful supply is the grace that has been freely given to us. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is His bountiful supply, is in our spirit; hence, Paul says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING TROUBLED BY OUR MIND<br />
BUT TURNING TO THE SPIRIT TO ENJOY THE LORD</h2>
<p>As human beings, we are not simple. Even though we have a spirit, we also have a disagreeable and troublesome soul. This can be illustrated by the Chinese character for <em>soul,</em> which includes the radical for <em>devil.</em> The character is written as a combination of <em>devil</em> and <em>say</em>. Therefore, the character for <em>soul</em> implies the devil speaking, or the devil expressing opinions. Every time we express our opinions, our soul is active, and this activity is of the devil. Opinions come from the mind, and our mind is the most troublesome part of our soul. For example, if we are laboring with a brother and quarrel over a certain matter, our thoughts concerning him will be easily affected. For example, we may criticize his attitude, or we may think that he has been disrespectful toward someone. If these thoughts are not dealt with, there will be no way for us to coordinate.</p>
<p>Conflicts also inevitably arise when sisters take measure of their husbands according to their thoughts. Similarly, those who live in a brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; house must learn to continuously exercise their spirit, not their mind. Without such an exercise, they will measure one another according to their mind and be continuously displeased with one another. We all need to exercise to live in spirit. The grace of the Lord is not in our mind, not in our emotions, and not in our will. His grace is in our spirit. As long as we live in spirit, we can enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s grace. This is a simple matter. For example, if a lamp in our home is connected to a power plug, we simply need to turn on the switch in order for light to shine. However, if we do not know about the switch, we may try to turn on the light by adjusting the light bulb on the ceiling. This would be useless and even foolish.</p>
<p>Today our Lord, as the all-sufficient Spirit, is the bountiful supply of grace in our spirit. Philippians 4:23 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.&rdquo; We must always turn to our spirit. When we are weak and turn to our spirit, we become strong. When we are in darkness and turn to our spirit, we become bright. When we are in anguish and turn to our spirit, we are comforted. When we do not know which way to take and turn to our spirit, we become clear. In every situation we need to turn to our spirit. Even when a husband and wife are about to quarrel, they need to turn to their spirit, kneel down, and call upon the name of the Lord. They must turn to their spirit. Consider what would happen if the husband prayed, &ldquo;Lord, I am about to argue with my wife. Give me the proper words to speak when I argue. Give me utterance when I release my temper.&rdquo; If he were honest in this way and touched the grace in his spirit, I truly doubt that he would have any desire to argue with his wife, and instead of releasing his temper, he would release his spirit. We all need to turn to our spirit.</p>
<p>Although it is very easy for a wife to bother her husband, the husband must learn to turn to his spirit, not to his mind, when he is in a bothersome situation. If a husband turns to his mind, his mind will cause problems and arouse his emotions even to the point of anger. Thus, he must turn to his spirit and simply say, &ldquo;O Lord.&rdquo; The more he is bothered, the more he needs to call on the Lord. He should not turn to his mind, because this brings in emotions, including anger. A bothersome situation is the best indication of our need to turn to the spirit. It is like a red light warning us to stop and turn to our spirit. Second Timothy 1:7 says, &ldquo;God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness.&rdquo; For power, we need to turn to our spirit. For love, we need to turn to our spirit. For sobermindedness, we need to turn to our spirit. In our spirit there is power, love, and sobermindedness. <em>Of power</em> refers to our will, <em>of love</em> refers to our emotion, and <em>of sobermindedness</em> refers to our mind. Our mind is clear and sober only when we turn to our spirit. Otherwise, our mind is muddled and cloudy. Furthermore, when we turn to our spirit, our emotions are adjusted, and we are able to receive others with a proper love. Furthermore, when we turn to our spirit, our will is steadfast, powerful, and exceedingly strong. In our spirit we have power, love, and sobermindedness.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE HUMAN SPIRIT<br />
TO EXPERIENCE THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The truth concerning our human spirit is very much neglected in Christianity. It is possible to hear numerous messages in Christianity concerning the Holy Spirit but not hear one message on the human spirit. Many have said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, before you came to the United States, we did not know that man has a spirit.&rdquo; In this Christian country most people do not know that they have a spirit even though the Bible speaks of both the Holy Spirit and the human spirit. From the Old Testament to the New Testament, there are many verses that speak of the human spirit. If we do not know our own spirit, we can never properly experience the Holy Spirit. In America Christianity emphasizes either doctrines or Pentecostal experiences associated with the Holy Spirit. However, neither of these enable us to properly experience the Spirit. Today our Lord is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit; therefore, we need to turn to the spirit. When we turn, we will have light, and our conscience will function to condemn or reprove us. When the light shines, we can be washed by the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood. The more we apply His precious blood, the more our inner being will be bright, and the more we are cleansed by His blood, the more we will enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence and riches in our spirit. This is the proper way.</p>
<p>We should not listen to nonsensical speaking related to tongues or foretelling. The greatest indication of the failure of the Pentecostal movement can be seen in the lack of any fulfillment of their &ldquo;prophetic&rdquo; utterances. In the Old Testament an unfulfilled prophecy was a serious matter. If an Israelite spoke a prophecy that was not fulfilled, he was to be counted as a false prophet and even put to death (Deut. 18:20-22). God condemned false prophets and even wanted such persons put to death so that others would not listen to their nonsense. When some Pentecostals in Taiwan prophesied that there would be a great revival in 1966, nothing happened because it was a false prophecy. Today in our studying and expounding of the Scriptures, we are very concerned about quoting things out of context. It is dangerous to emphasize even a single sentence in the Bible without considering the entire context. Knowing something in a superficial way is dangerous. Regrettably, many Pentecostals do not use the term <em>tongues</em> according to its biblical context. Instead, they care only for their interpretations, and they neglect everything else. This is utterly dangerous.</p>
<p>If we consider the whole Bible, we will see that the proper way to experience the Spirit is to know the Spirit in our spirit. Philippians 4:23 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.&rdquo; We need to turn to our spirit and not focus on our mind, emotion, or will. When we call upon His name, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; we will touch our spirit and not be in our mind, emotion, or will. We need to exercise our feet by walking, and we need to exercise our spirit by calling on the Lord. If we are being bothered by our spouse, we will surely fail if we do not call on the Lord, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah.&rdquo; We can overcome by calling, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; Satan has no way when we turn to our spirit. The simplest way to turn to our spirit is by calling on the name of the Lord and by pray-reading His Word. When we call on the Lord and pray-read His Word, we are in spirit, and we are inwardly filled with Him.</p>
<p>This is the safest way to be filled with the Holy Spirit. There is no need for fasting, for abstaining from sleep, or for looking for something to fall from heaven. When we seek for experiences in this way, that is, waiting for something to fall from heaven, is it any wonder that some will eventually start speaking in tongues? The Pentecostal movement teaches others to seek such experiences, but eighty or ninety percent of the time, these experiences are not genuine. This kind of seeking even opens the door to demons. Cases of demon possession in the Pentecostal movement are undeniable. I have had experiences of casting out demons from some who were in the Pentecostal movement. In their passive waiting for the so-called filling of the Holy Spirit, they emptied themselves and opened themselves in a way that allowed evil spirits to come into them. This does not mean that there is no such thing as genuinely speaking in tongues, but most of the tongue-speaking today involves &ldquo;self-manufactured&rdquo; tongue-speaking and even some cases of demon possession. These are not proper experiences of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE SPIRIT, EXERCISING THE SPIRIT,<br />
AND MANIFESTING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The scriptural way is to experience the grace of the Lord in our spirit (Phil. 4:23). We need to learn to be burning in spirit (Rom. 12:11); that is, we need to learn to use our spirit, exercise our spirit, manifest our spirit, and act by our spirit. When we exercise our spirit, we will touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence in our spirit. Then our spirit will be open to the Lord, and the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit will permeate, saturate, and possess us until He gains us fully. Thus, we will be one with the Lord, even one spirit with the Lord. This is the proper way to experience the Spirit.</p>
<p>I hope we will not have a curiosity for spiritual experiences that lead us to fast, abstain from sleep, or wait for something to fall down from heaven. We need to learn to take the simple way revealed in the Scriptures. Paul says, &ldquo;God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:7). He also says, &ldquo;God...whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son&rdquo; (Rom. 1:9). Paul&rsquo;s service to God was in his spirit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Paul also told the Corinthians, &ldquo;My speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:4). When Paul first arrived in Corinth, his speech and proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit. The demonstration of the Spirit comes from our human spirit. Today the Spirit of God is joined to our spirit. When we exercise our spirit, the Spirit of God joins in. This is the manifestation of our spirit. Our emphasis is not on manifesting eloquence or wisdom but on our spirit, which is to manifest the Spirit of God in our spirit. This can be likened to a sister who is naturally graceful, who has been highly educated and is able to speak persuasive, tactful words and give refined testimonies. Although her words may be persuasive, this does not mean that there has been a demonstration of Spirit. In contrast, a sister who simply calls, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; will actively manifest the Spirit.</p>
<p>John Sung&rsquo;s preaching did not depend on eloquence but on the manifestation of the Spirit. He was from Putian, Fukien. The Mandarin spoken in this region is not very polished. There is even a saying that one does not need to fear heaven or hell but only a Putianese speaking Mandarin. John Sung&rsquo;s sermons seemingly did not have much content. When he preached, he often wore a long gown and used small props. Once when he was speaking, he showed the people an opium pipe, a mah-jongg tile, and a small coffin. When he showed them the coffin, he cried, &ldquo;Get a promotion! Make a fortune! Make a coffin!&rdquo; That was his sermon. Another time he brought out a conductor&rsquo;s baton and pointed to a young woman in the audience and addressed her as a concubine. Everyone was concerned that he had offended the woman, but his word was a manifestation of the Spirit that day because she was indeed a concubine. Nevertheless, the woman was very angry because she thought someone had told John Sung about her. Throughout the night, however, the Holy Spirit operated in her, saying, &ldquo;Do you blame that preacher? Think about it: Are you not a concubine, a sinner?&rdquo; Through this enlightenment, she repented. The next day she came to the meeting in tears. This shows that although John Sung had no eloquence, no persuasive words of wisdom, there was a manifestation of the Spirit in his speaking.</p>
<p>One time he was preaching about the woman with the flow of blood in the Gospel of Mark (5:21-43). He drew a heart on the blackboard and said, &ldquo;Dr. John Sung came, and the church members became zealous, and they said, &lsquo;The precious blood of Jesus has cleansed our hearts; it cleansed our hearts.&rsquo;&rdquo; Then he filled in the outline of the heart with white chalk and said, &ldquo;Dr. Sung left, and after two months the heart of the church members grew cold. The precious blood leaked out. Hemorrhaging! Hemorrhaging!&rdquo; What kind of doctrine is this? How can the precious blood be likened to blood that hemorrhages? He continued, saying, &ldquo;More time went by, and Brother Wang Ming-tao came, and again the church members became zealous, saying, &lsquo;The precious blood of Jesus has cleansed my heart.&rsquo; But in another three months, the precious blood leaked out again.&rdquo; Then he erased the chalk on the board to reveal the black heart. His doctrine was not according to the truth, but no one could deny the manifestation of the Spirit in his speaking. In the end he said, &ldquo;All those who want the precious blood to cleanse their heart come forward.&rdquo; Crowds of people moved forward, many bursting into tears, kneeling down, and praying again and again, &ldquo;The precious blood cleanses my heart!&rdquo; and &ldquo;May the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood cleanse my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Sung did not have persuasive words of wisdom, but he had the manifestation of the Spirit, the demonstration of the Holy Spirit. When he spoke, the Spirit went forth; when he spoke, he touched men&rsquo;s spirit, and they felt the filthiness of their heart and their need for cleansing by the precious blood of Christ. If a person had been saved for many years without much growth, he would have been touched to return to the Lord for His cleansing. Although the doctrine in John Sung&rsquo;s sermon was not accurate, his spirit was right. We are not promoting the use of wrong doctrines, but we need to manifest the Spirit in addition to just presenting right doctrines. Persuasive words of wisdom alone cannot touch the spirit of others. When words come from the Spirit and touch the spirit of others, there is a supply even if the words are not so fine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GENUINE BUILDING BEING IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Paul spoke to the Corinthians, saying, &ldquo;I, on my part, though being absent in the body but present in the spirit, have already judged, as if being present, him who has thus done this&rdquo; (1 Cor. 5:3). When the Corinthians met together, Paul&rsquo;s spirit was with them in their gathering, even though he was not present with them in his body. This proves how much Paul lived in the spirit. Do we have such an experience, that is, of being in Kaohsiung but meeting in spirit in Taipei? At times, when I am in Los Angeles, it is as if I were meeting in Taipei in spirit. In 16:17-18 Paul mentioned the names of a few brothers who refreshed his and the Corinthians&rsquo; spirit. These brothers refreshed Paul&rsquo;s spirit. The most precious thing in being a Christian is to have a refreshed spirit. Paul was a person who fully lived in the spirit. Second Corinthians 12:18 shows that Paul and Titus were &ldquo;in the same spirit.&rdquo; In Revelation 1:10 the apostle John said, &ldquo;I was in spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and heard.&rdquo; At the end of Revelation, John was carried away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and saw the New Jerusalem (21:10). Our hearing and our seeing are both matters that are in the spirit. We must live in spirit, and we must exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;You also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; The dwelling place of God is our spirit. When we live in spirit and exercise our spirit, we become one in spirit. This is the genuine building. Today genuine building is not in our mind, emotion, or will but in our spirit. When we turn to our spirit, there is coordination with one another. When we turn to our spirit, there is oneness with one another, and when we turn to our spirit, there is building with one another. The building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place is in our spirit, and the dwelling of God is in our spirit.</p>
<p>Our Lord has accomplished everything. He is now the life-giving Spirit living in our spirit to be our bountiful supply, which is just grace for everything. We need to exercise our spirit to touch Him in order to live in and move by the spirit. When we are persons who live in the spirit, we will be coordinated in oneness, and we will be built together to be the dwelling place of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">KEEPING THE GROUND OF ONENESS<br />
TO BE DELIVERED FROM DIVISION AND CONFUSION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 12, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 17:4-5; Gen. 11:9; Deut. 12:5-7; Ezra 1:1-6; Acts 2:14; 1 Cor. 1:10-12; Rev. 21:2, 18, 21</h1>
<p>In the preceding chapters we saw that the revelation in the Bible is altogether related to the Spirit of God and the human spirit. After God accomplished creation and man fell, God was manifested in the flesh in order to accomplish redemption through His death on the cross, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. When man opens to the Lord, the Spirit, as the all-inclusive Spirit, enters into man&rsquo;s spirit to be one with him. When the Holy Spirit and our human spirit become one spirit, we are mingled as one spirit with Him. In our living today, we need to exercise to live by our spirit and serve by our spirit. I believe that all the saints are clear about this truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SYMBOL OF TWO WOMEN IN REVELATION</h2>
<p>I would like to fellowship about another crucial matter in this chapter, laying a basic truth before you concerning the way that you should take in your service to the Lord for your whole life. If you know this basic truth, it will become a compass to guide you and guard you on your life&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>There are two names in the Bible that represent two principles and two ways: Jerusalem and Babylon. Each of these names is symbolized by women. Revelation 17 and 18 speak of Babylon as a harlot (17:5; 18:2-3), and chapters 19 and 21 speak of Jerusalem as a wife and bride (19:7; 21:2). Babylon is represented by a woman in a negative sense as a harlot. Being a harlot is even more negative than being an adulteress. An adulteress is a woman who has unlawful contact with a man other than her husband, whereas a harlot is a woman who contacts men loosely and does not even have a husband. Verse 5 of chapter 17 says, &ldquo;On her forehead there was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&rdquo; She is the mother of the harlots and the abominations of the earth. Babylon is not only a harlot; she is the mother of harlots, having given birth to many daughters, each one of whom also is a harlot. Thus, she is called &ldquo;the mother of the harlots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Babylon is a harlot, Jerusalem is a bride, a chaste wife. This may not seem to be an exciting doctrine, but like a compass, it points us in the right direction. The sixty-six books of the Bible speak of many things and contain many revelations. In the end, however, there are two women. The conclusion of the Bible, the last chapters of the book of Revelation, is a story of Babylon and Jerusalem&mdash;two cities and two women. We need to have a clear understanding of the principles represented by these two women so that we may serve the Lord in a proper way. This is exceedingly crucial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF BABYLON<br />
BEING DIVISION AND CONFUSION</h2>
<p>In a sense, the whole Bible is a story of Babylon and Jerusalem. One may say that the Bible is the history of the struggle between Babylon and Jerusalem. <em>Babylon</em> is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word <em>Babel,</em> which is mentioned in Genesis 11:9, and it means &ldquo;confusion.&rdquo; Hence, Babylon means confusion, and confusion means to be without regulation or governing principles. For example, the chairs in this meeting are aligned in straight rows, and this method of alignment is a governing principle. If the chairs were unevenly aligned, crookedly placed next to each other, or even overturned, it would indicate that the chairs are in a confused and unprincipled situation, a situation that reflects the principle of Babylon.</p>
<p>God created one man in the beginning, and out from this man came many men. At Babel these men formed an alliance among themselves to build a tower in rebellion and in opposition to God. Hence, God confounded their language, producing many languages. The people on the earth became divided at this point, and once there was division, there was confusion. Division is included in confusion; without division there is no confusion, and without confusion there is no division. Man spoke the same language originally and was not divided or confused until the time of Babel. Babylon represents division and confusion. In the church there are many brothers and sisters, but we are not divided or in confusion; hence, the church is not Babylon. If, however, some sisters quarrel with other sisters, and some brothers fight with other brothers to the point that they decide to no longer meet with the saints and instead set up another place of meeting, the resulting division is in the principle of Babylon. Babylon represents division and confusion.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF JERUSALEM<br />
BEING ONENESS WITHOUT CONFUSION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Confusion and Oneness in the Old Testament History</h2>
<p>After the tower of Babel in Genesis 11, man was divided and confused on the earth. God, however, came to Ur of the Chaldeans, the location of Babylon, and in the midst of a divided and confused situation, He called out Abraham and brought him to the land of Canaan and gave him the land (12:1-5). Although Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, the twelve tribes of Israel, subsequently failed because of famine and left the land of Canaan to go down into Egypt, God redeemed them and brought them out of Egypt, back to the land of Canaan. Even though there were twelve tribes in the land of Israel, God did not allow His people to be in a situation of division and confusion. Rather, God maintained the oneness of His people by establishing a unique center of worship on a unique ground. In Deuteronomy God repeatedly exhorted and charged the children of Israel not to casually worship and offer up sacrifices in any place. Instead, He charged them to worship at the unique place that He had chosen to put His name (12:5-7; 14:22-23; 15:20; 16:2, 5-7, 15-16). This unique ground, center, and place of worship maintained and preserved the oneness among God&rsquo;s people. This place was Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Whereas Babylon signifies division and confusion, Jerusalem signifies oneness without confusion. This is a matter of biblical history. Babylon represents division and confusion among men, and Jerusalem represents the oneness of God&rsquo;s people without confusion. Even though the children of Israel were made up of twelve tribes, their normal condition did not involve division and confusion. Furthermore, even though the Jews have been scattered throughout the nations, there never has been more than one holy temple on the earth. The site for the holy temple is in Jerusalem. All Jews are clear concerning God&rsquo;s charge in chapters 12, 14, 15, and 16; consequently, no one has dared to build a temple in any other place. Today all the Jews are awaiting the rebuilding of the holy temple on the temple site, which is the high peak of Zion in Jerusalem. Only this place is the center and unique ground of their oneness. Jerusalem represents the oneness of God&rsquo;s people without confusion, and Babylon represents division and confusion.</p>
<p>At the time of 2 Kings 25, the children of Israel were in desolation. Consequently, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came with his whole army, breached the walls of Jerusalem, destroyed the holy temple, and took the captured Israelites to Babylon. Jerusalem was conquered by Babylon. When Babylon overcame Jerusalem, God&rsquo;s people were scattered everywhere, and they lost their oneness. After seventy years, God enabled the scattered captives, particularly the Israelites in Babylon, to rise up and return to Jerusalem (Ezra 1:1-6). Leaving Jerusalem is a matter of scattering and confusion, but returning to Jerusalem is a matter of recovering the oneness without confusion. The book of Ezra shows that only a small number of the children of Israel returned to Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the testimony of Jerusalem was recovered. This recovery lasted until the first coming of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confusion and Division in the New Testament History</h2>
<p>The Old Testament speaks of things that have historical, physical, and symbolic significance. With the coming of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament, the spiritual significance of these things becomes apparent. For example, when the church was formed on the day of Pentecost, the situation of division that was brought in at Babel was reversed by the spiritual reality of the formation of the church. At Babel everyone spoke different languages or dialects, and no one could understand each other. But on the day of Pentecost, when people who spoke different languages from various nations were gathered in Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples, and they spoke in tongues so that these people could understand. At Babel there were division and confusion; at Pentecost in Jerusalem there was oneness without confusion. According to the record of Acts 2:14, when Peter stood with the eleven and spoke, everyone heard his word, and &ldquo;they were pricked in their heart&rdquo; (v. 37). Thus, the division and confusion brought in by Babel were terminated, and there was oneness in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The church is the genuine Jerusalem, and it is based on the principle of oneness without confusion. This is the spiritual reality of Jerusalem. The spiritual reality of Jerusalem is the church, and the church is one and without confusion. Today in the church we can worship God in oneness and without confusion. Both God&rsquo;s name and God&rsquo;s habitation are with the church. Acts 2 records the oneness and the absence of confusion in the church on the day of Pentecost; this is Jerusalem. However, Satan still has subtle schemes. In 1 Corinthians 1:10 Paul said to the Corinthians, &ldquo;Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s exhortation to speak the same thing indicates that there were divisions among the Corinthians: one said that he was of Paul, another said that he was of Cephas, and yet another said that he was of Christ (v. 12). At Pentecost there was oneness without confusion, but in Corinth there were division and confusion, and even the reappearance of a spiritual aspect of Babylon. The spiritual aspect of Jerusalem was manifested on the day of Pentecost, but the spiritual aspect of Babylon was later manifested in Corinth. Gradually, this confusion developed into Roman Catholicism.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MIXTURE IN ROMAN CATHOLICISM</h2>
<p>Bible readers recognize that Babylon the Great, the mysterious Babylon, mentioned in Revelation 17, refers to Roman Catholicism. By studying history, it is easy to see that Roman Catholicism is associated with Babylon the Great because it is full of divisions and confusion. When some ask, &ldquo;Are there no children of God in Catholicism?&rdquo; we should acknowledge that there are, but they are in a situation of mixture. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls.&rdquo; Those who have a little understanding of Roman Catholicism know that red is the most distinctive and vivid color in the Vatican.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21 the New Jerusalem is the bride (v. 2), the city is of pure gold (v. 18), the foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every precious stone (v. 19), and each of the gates is, respectively, of one pearl (v. 21). Catholicism, however, uses gold, precious stones, and pearls only in the way of gilding, which refers to outward adornment by layering gold, precious stones, and pearls on something that is not of the same material. In Roman Catholicism there truly have been some lovers of the Lord. Madame Guyon can be likened to a pearl, and Brother Lawrence can be likened to a precious stone. However, these exceptions do not represent the true nature of Catholicism. They speak only of an aspect of adornment in Catholicism.</p>
<p>Verse 4 of chapter 17 says, &ldquo;Having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations.&rdquo; In typology gold signifies the divine nature. Therefore, the golden cup shows that on the surface Roman Catholicism does indeed have some things related to God. She preaches the unique God and declares the name of Jesus Christ, but her &ldquo;golden cup&rdquo; is &ldquo;full of abominations.&rdquo; This is Roman Catholicism today. Although there are some genuine children of God, some gold and precious stones and pearls within her, they are mixed in among evil and unclean things.</p>
<p>Verse 5 says, &ldquo;On her forehead there was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&rdquo; This mysterious Great Babylon is the great harlot, the mother of many harlots. This mother is a great harlot who has given birth to many daughters, each one of whom is a harlot. The great harlot is Roman Catholicism, the mysterious Babylon. Revelation is a book of revelation and prophecy. Chapter 17 is a prophecy concerning Roman Catholicism and the various denominations, sects, and groups in Protestantism, which evolved from Roman Catholicism and which are all the harlot daughters of the great harlot. There certainly are things of God and children of God in Protestantism, but they are under the influence of Roman Catholicism, and they are in a situation full of division and confusion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE PROPER GROUND<br />
IN ADDITION TO SPIRITUALITY</h2>
<p>Today it seems as if God&rsquo;s children care only for spirituality and have no consideration for the proper ground. In addition to various denominations in Protestantism, there are many small free groups that are apparently quite spiritual. However, in God&rsquo;s eyes they are divided, confused, without principle, and without regulation because they follow their own preferences. If a married woman is not faithful to her husband, it does not matter how meek and kind she is toward others; she is still in a confused and improper situation. Her meekness and kindness mean nothing. In God&rsquo;s creation there is a governing principle of one husband and one wife. If a woman does not care for God&rsquo;s principle but only for her preferences and tastes, God&rsquo;s principle will be violated. Regrettably, this is the condition in today&rsquo;s Christianity. All the denominations, sects, and free groups in Christianity have been established according to preferences, which result in the violation of God&rsquo;s principle.</p>
<p>In contrast, a married sister who sees the principle of one husband and one wife will be preserved from the temptation of following her own preferences and tastes even if her marriage is difficult at times. In Matthew 19:7 the Pharisees disputed with Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and divorce her?&rdquo; Jesus answered them, saying, &ldquo;Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so&rdquo; (v. 8). The Lord told the Pharisees that divorce was not according to God&rsquo;s principle from the beginning. He recovered the significance of human marriage to correspond with God&rsquo;s original ordination.</p>
<p>Today various groups in Christianity are like women who act according to their preferences and tastes, but they only produce confusion. This is inappropriate, because initially Christians met according to the principle of oneness without confusion. Oneness is the way that was from the beginning. I would like to inoculate the young people from the temptations that come from speakings like &ldquo;Such-and-such fellowship is so good; let us go there,&rdquo; &ldquo;Such-and-such denomination is so good; let us go there,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I know a place where we can listen to many good sermons.&rdquo; When you hear such things, you need to reply, &ldquo;Please stay away from me. I cannot go to Babylon. I cannot follow that great harlot Babylon or follow any of her daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Christians do not take the matter of the oneness of the church seriously, they will fall into the principle of the harlot and be involved with the many daughters of the harlot, even if they are not involved with the great harlot. Today we should take only the way of Jerusalem; we should not casually follow any Babylonian principle. Babylon represents division and confusion; any division and confusion are of Babylon or of the daughters of Babylon. They are all harlots in God&rsquo;s eyes. We have no desire to accuse others loosely but rather to proclaim God&rsquo;s truth and holy Word faithfully.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLDING FAST THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE OF GOD&mdash;<br />
ONE CITY, ONE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We have all seen that the great harlot in Revelation 17, Babylon the Great, is Roman Catholicism, and her daughters are divisive Christian groups established at will, based on self-preferences. These groups have taken the way of harlots, falling into the position of a harlot, by not holding fast to God&rsquo;s governing principle. God&rsquo;s governing principle is oneness&mdash;one city, one church&mdash;just as in a household there can be only one husband and one wife. Because there is one Christ, there should also be one church.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s ordination is related to Jerusalem, but Jerusalem is troubled by the division and confusion of Babylon. Today division and confusion are prevalent because there are so many denominations, sects, and free groups in Christianity. There is nothing that can be put on their signs that will change the fact that they are in the principle of a harlot because of their division and confusion. Divisions produce harlots; this is an extremely serious matter. In contrast, Jerusalem is oneness without confusion. There is only one church in Taipei even though there are many meeting halls, because the saints in Taipei are one and without confusion. If another &ldquo;church&rdquo; were established in Taipei, it would be in the principle of Babylon. We need to be cautious because divisiveness and division are not small matters. Several years ago some brothers did not see the seriousness of this matter, and they went out from among us to set up their own meetings. The result of this has been division upon division and confusion upon confusion.</p>
<p>Those who create division and confusion, no matter the reason, are in the principle of being a small harlot in God&rsquo;s eyes. Whether or not a Christian group is a small harlot is not dependent upon its spiritual condition but on its position and standing. If some are standing as the church in Taipei, the establishment of another &ldquo;church&rdquo; only creates division, and it involves the divisive ones in the principle of Babylon. There is a church in Taipei, and all the saints in Taipei should know that in God&rsquo;s eyes the establishment of another group involves the principle of Babylon.</p>
<p>We must hold fast to God&rsquo;s governing principle whether we are in Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, or Keelung. There cannot be another &ldquo;church&rdquo; in a locality where a church is standing on the ground of oneness. If there is, the principle of the harlot is present. We all need this compass, and we need to clearly see that Babylon is related to division and confusion but that Jerusalem is related to oneness without confusion. The church is today&rsquo;s Jerusalem, and any activity outside the church, no matter the group or the acts, comes from those who are standing in the position of a harlot. Although these words are not pleasant to the ear, I must speak them because a desire for acceptance from man cannot replace the need to speak God&rsquo;s word truthfully.</p></body></html>
