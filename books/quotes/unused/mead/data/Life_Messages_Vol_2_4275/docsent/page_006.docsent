   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have many dear friends in Christianity or in the world, and when we first came into the church we damaged many of them by sharing in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As you say, we do need to pray and go to the Word, but I still would like some practical help as to what to do for these whom we have damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The best way to heal this situation is to pray for the ones you damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not initiate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Contact the Lord and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As you do so, you will know His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He may lead you to go to some of them, not only to become reconciled but also to say a word about God's economy to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the Lord leads, you go.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If not, do not go.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not feel that because you did some damage, you must try to set matters right.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not initiate anything with that in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Simply follow the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not go to others with the intention of correcting some damage you may have caused.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To do so is to play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you go, you do so because you are led of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have no choice but to be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You do not care for the result but simply follow Him because you are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This should be your attitude regardless of how many you have damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the past is under the blood and is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now is a new day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the Lord moves, you move.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What He does you do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The past is over.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The future you do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You have only today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We Christians do not live in tomorrow nor in yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have only today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are two schools of thought on preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One is to be burdened, pray, and go as the Lord leads.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The other is to be instant in season and out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Could you say something about this?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you keep contacting the Lord, you will find that you are preaching all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if you neglect contacting the Lord and take up the exhortation to be instant in season and out of season 2 Tim 4:2 , you will be keeping a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This would be religious; that is, you would be doing something for God without Christ's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we keep contacting the Lord and live with Him, we shall spontaneously preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord says, "He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit" John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you abide, surely you will bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you do not bear fruit, it means you are not abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet if you try to bear fruit without abiding, that is your doing and becomes religious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's economy is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may compare it to the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For a person to breathe, he has to be living.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you try to breathe yet you do not have life, you are seeking to fulfill a requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when you are living, you breathe unconsciously, whatever else you are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may be busy and not notice that you are breathing, but nonetheless the breathing goes on.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the same way, if you abide in the Lord have life , you will bear fruit breathe .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is no point in talking about someone's physical problems if he is no longer alive.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Doctors prescribe medication based upon the fact of your being alive.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once you are dead, they can do nothing to help.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Medication has no effect if you are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Surgery too would be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many times a surgeon will not operate if the patient is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even if the surgery was well done, without the support of the patient's life, it would be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Life is what matters in the church life too.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christianity may maneuver, arrange, and organize, but in the Lord's recovery we have seen that where there is life, there is no need for so many plans and schedules.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The body does not plan what it will do and say during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As long as it is alive, all its members function spontaneously in a good coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In our life with the Lord, we contact Him by reading His Word and praying and by being one with Him all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We do not need to anticipate anything nor regulate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Let us simply live Christ the way the branches abide in the vine.</S>
