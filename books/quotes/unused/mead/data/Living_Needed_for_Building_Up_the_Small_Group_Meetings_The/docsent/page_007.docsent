   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TEACHING OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO WALK ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Christian life is not a life according to culture.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not a life of religion, ethics, morality, tradition, or customs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Christian life is a living that is out of the Holy Spirit and through the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is also a living whose walk is according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Unfortunately, you and I have not yet attained to that standard.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many brothers and sisters are very pious toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are very strict toward themselves and very forgiving toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their manner of life is very honest and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We Chinese have been taught this way from our youth, and in our daily life we are very much controlled and governed by these teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As far as Confucius is concerned, this kind of behavior is good, and as far as morality and ethics is concerned, it is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such behavior is upheld by tradition and welcomed by natural reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But as far as God s economy is concerned, it is off the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God does not approve any of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He does not approve anything that is not according to His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the New Testament apostles came to realize, even the ordinances that were given by God in the Old Testament have all been set aside Eph 2:15; Col 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul shows us in the book of Galatians that if a man desires to keep the law, he is severed from Christ and has fallen from grace Gal 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is made of no effect to him Gal 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This does not mean that we have the liberty to break the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not a matter of keeping the law or of breaking the law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To keep the law is a matter of good, and to break the law is a matter of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Both good and evil are from the same tree, the tree of knowledge of good and evil Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the tree of life is neither a matter of good nor a matter of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a matter of life, and this life is Christ John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Romans 7:21 Paul said that whenever he desired to do good, evil was present with him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who live in the realm of the tree of knowledge of good and evil are always in turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul cried, Wretched man that I am!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who will deliver me from the body of this death?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then in chapter eight he declared that the law of the Spirit of life had freed him 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we have not the law of good nor the law of evil, but the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To most people, it is commendable to be able to differentiate between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To their way of thinking, it is right to be lawful, moral, and ethical.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Chinese classics say that the way of the higher teaching is in the development of the bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as a person will develop the bright virtue within him, he is good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But to the Christian this is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The teaching of life is not a matter of developing the bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The teaching of life is to walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The teaching of Confucius exhorts man to cultivate and develop the bright virtue within him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we Christians are not here to develop that bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are here to develop the spirit within us which is mingled with Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This mingled spirit within us is much higher than the bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually, the bright virtue is simply the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The bright virtue of Confucius is the conscience that Wang Yang-ming, another Chinese philosopher, spoke about.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the teachings concerning the development of the bright virtue are the result of the highest discoveries of the Chinese philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They discovered that within man there is the noblest part, which is the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But within us the believers is a spirit which contains the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is much higher than the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I hope that the brothers and sisters will hear this word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What many seeking Christians are doing today is simply developing their bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are not walking according to the spirit within them which is mingled with God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Bible does not teach us to develop our bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It does not tell us to cultivate our natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, it teaches us to walk according to the spirit Rom 8:4; Gal 5:16a, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This spirit is the mingled spirit which is produced when the Spirit of God enters into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Spirit of God is the life-giving Spirit who has passed through creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today this Spirit has entered into the spirits of all those who are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God s intention today is not for us to develop our bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, He wants us to walk according to that inward spirit in which God s presence dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The way of the higher teaching is in the development of the bright virtue; but the teaching of life is in walking according to the spirit.</S>
