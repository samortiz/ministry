   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ABSENCE OF FEELING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to tell you the secret of abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is based upon my experience, not on the black and white pages of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matters concerning life are not characterized by feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you have a stomachache, you know something is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you have a pain in the chest, you need to see a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you are in good health, however, you are not conscious of any particular feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The same is true when you are abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As soon as you are out of Christ, you are aware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you criticize a brother, you know deep within that you are not abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even in a small matter, like smiling a little, you may sense that you are not abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may say yes to a question and sense that your answer was a political one, spoken apart from the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you find yourself in a difficult situation, do not react.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you feel you are not abiding in Christ, do not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If your wife starts an argument with you and you feel you are not abiding, do not answer or even look at her.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not even pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let her keep talking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not say, "Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That would be coming from your flesh and would only further aggravate her.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Practicing not to do anything is the negative secret of abiding in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you feel drawn to love something apart from the abiding, refrain from loving it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Lord, I turn away from whatever does not come from my abiding in You."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this divine birth two spirits have been joined into one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The divine part within has the desire to worship the Father; the divine Spirit would worship by your human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This divine part also loves and appreciates the words spoken by the Lord, His instant practical speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This divine part further tells you that the Father and the Son are making an abode with you, and that you are abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever you sense within that you are not abiding, say, "Lord, forgive me and cleanse me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I don't want to be out of the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I want to stay in You all the time."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this abiding we pray without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our prayer while we are abiding is simply our spontaneous trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>SIGNS OF ABIDING</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How many of you will practice this?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who do will find that they are in practice one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are one in the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At times they will not say even a word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They will not take any action.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They will not express an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They simply remain in the spirit that involves the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this abiding they have holiness; victory over sin, the world, Satan, the flesh, and the self; spirituality; the actuality of being a member of the Body of Christ; the normal Christian life; and the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No problem remains, for they are one with the Son of God, who has conquered all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of striving, they enjoy what He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their unceasing prayer is the expression of their constant trust in this living One who is now one Spirit with them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This should be the experience of all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have tried various ways in the past to overcome sin and be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we have learned that the secret of all the hows is in the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we abide in this mingled spirit, every spiritual blessing is ours, because it is wrapped up in this dear One.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Him, this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, is the processed God; the uplifted humanity; the all-inclusive death and resurrection; redemption; and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let us abide in Him and enjoy His all-inclusiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>LOVE AND VISION</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To believe in the Lord is adequate for us to have the divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But to enjoy the divine birth by abiding, we need to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Gospel of John first tells us to believe in Him, then to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him" 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This making of the mutual abode depends upon a constant love on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On His side the love is always there.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Keep this vision always before you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not allow any veil to cover your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not be side-tracked by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not say you cannot stand a certain brother, that the church life is not so good in your locality, or that the recovery has gone downhill these past years.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Any such remark will keep you out of the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One complaint can cut your lifeline.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To criticize or murmur is like slashing your wrists.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Your life will ebb away.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not for you to evaluate whether the church is high or low, or whether the brothers are spiritual or fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Your business is to abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the church is really poor, by your abiding it will be uplifted and enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The remedy for the church comes from the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Stay in this divine place, involving the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Worship here.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Receive the instant word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As you live in Him and He dwells in you, there is a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this place you are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Your Christ will be no longer merely doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He will be your experience all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You will be able to testify that you are one with Him and He with you, even that you are abiding in this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I believe we have all experienced abiding in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The problem has been that we have not made it a constant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Now we must come to the place of constant abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The whole world will be under our feet!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We shall not utter a vain word.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Whatever we are will be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Whatever we do will be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whatever we say will be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>"For to me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 will be our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Galatians 2:20 will be true of us, that we have been crucified with Christ, nevertheless we live; yet not we, but Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It will be hard to distinguish whether this is He or we.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We and He are one.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord's recovery needs this.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>There is the need of this abiding life that the church life may be enriched.</S>
