   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We also have to overcome frustrations for our preaching of the gospel in the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was recently fellowshipping with some brothers about my feeling that the Lord's recovery should reconsider its direction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The world has changed and it is still changing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There have been four great recent changes in the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, today Europe has a common market.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, East and West Germany have been united.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Third, there has been much political change in the small European countries.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fourth, Russia and all her satellite countries have changed and are still changing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the leaders of this earth are considering what steps to take for their economy, their industry, and their education for their future among all the nations on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have pointed out in the past that the entire world situation is the preparation for the Lord's move in His gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book of Isaiah shows that God's chastisement of His chosen people and His judgment of the nations ushers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is just the gospel, and the world situation is for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The present world is changing for the advancement of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even the Lord Jesus came as the world was changing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Roman general Pompey had conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C. In 27 B.C. Augustus received the approval of the Roman Senate to form the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That prepared the way for Christ's birth just twenty-seven years later.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The apostles' preaching of the gospel followed the political situation at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the past twenty centuries, the gospel has always traveled according to the political changes on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The brothers who have traveled to Russia recently have shared that the Lord has opened up Russia to our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are many encouraging letters from the Russian people testifying of this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We cannot merely observe this situation and be complacent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to reconsider our direction in light of the world situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Acts 13 shows five prophets and teachers in the church in Antioch fasting and praying together.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the guidance came that Paul and Barnabas should be separated and sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They carried the gospel from Antioch to Asia Minor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That was a big step for the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe that these five prophets and teachers were considering how to bring the Lord's gospel from the Holy Land to the Gentile world, and during their consideration, the guidance came.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Paul's second journey, he and his co-workers intended to speak the word in Asia, but they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit Acts 16:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then they tried to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them v. 7 . The Holy Spirit's forbidding them to go to the left, to Asia, and the Spirit of Jesus' not allowing them to go to the right, to Bithynia, indicated a straightforward direction for the apostle and his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Spontaneously, they should have just gone forward to Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But Paul had to receive a vision during the night of a Macedonian man entreating him to come over across the Aegean Sea into Macedonia to help them v. 9 . Then Paul and his co-workers concluded that God had called them to bring the good news to Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They crossed the Aegean Sea into Europe and came to Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Philippi was a fortified outpost of the Roman Empire in a foreign country, where the citizens had equal rights with those at the capital, Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a fort of the ancient empire of Rome, Philippi was a very strategic city for the spread of the gospel at its beginning in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From there the gospel spread throughout Europe and eventually to Greece and Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to consider the present world situation and our present direction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Should we just look at the situation and say that everything is good with the Lord's recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many young ones among us have been trained in the past few years, and we presently have over one hundred in the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are praying about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It may be that in our next term of training, we will change our language lessons to Russian, French, and German, plus British English.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If one has a knowledge of these four languages, he can travel and speak to people throughout nearly all of Europe and Russia.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I encourage the young people to learn French, German, and Russian for the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In these days we need to pay our full attention to the all-inclusive Christ, who is the centrality and universality of the great wheel of the move of the Divine Trinity for the divine dispensing of Himself into His elect.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the church life for the Lord's recovery, where the proper revival and restoration of life are taking place, Christ should be the twig, the branch, the banner, and the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First, we ourselves must have a restoration of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then this will be propagated and will be designated by a banner, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He will then be sought after by the nations, and He will become a standard to them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah for Christ!</S>
