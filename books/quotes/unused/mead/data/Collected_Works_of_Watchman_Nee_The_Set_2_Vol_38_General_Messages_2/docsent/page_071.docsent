   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Third, as a consequence of self-exaltation, you think that others should not be as highly regarded as you.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You only want to see yourself being uplifted; you do not want to see others being uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You only want to gain something for yourself; you do not want others to gain anything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You rejoice at others' failure and are sad at others' success.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is jealousy, and jealousy occurs not only in the secular realm but also in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who are proud rejoice at their brothers' failures and are unhappy when they see their brothers standing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a despicable attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No attitude is more despicable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a man rejoices when others fall, he is the same as Satan, who loves to see others fall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What a shame for God's children to have Satan's sentiment!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The meanest and most despicable sentiment is one which rejoices rather than grieves over a brother's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The basis for this kind of feeling is the desire for the self to be exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One hopes to see everyone around him fall in order that he can be exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brothers and sisters, a person who knows God wants to see both himself and others rise.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who do not know God want to see themselves rise, yet do not want to see others rise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They even hope to see others fall so that they can be exalted by the contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a despicable sentiment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Temper often comes because there is jealousy in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you are a self-exalting person, you will be angry if you see someone better and higher than you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jealousy leads to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you ignore jealousy and try to deal with just your temper, you will never succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must uproot jealousy from your heart before you can remove your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If jealousy remains, your temper will flare up again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Fourth, with some people the self is expressed in the form of self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They love themselves more than anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Their attention is on themselves, and the only persons they treasure dearly are themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When it comes to eating, the most important ones to be taken care of are themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When it comes to lodging, the first ones to be taken care of are themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When it comes to bedding, the first ones to be taken care of are themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In everything related to the human life, the first ones in their mind are themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They want more benefit for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They want more comfort for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All of their thoughts are centered around themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They care for themselves and treasure themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When any discomfort comes their way, they become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many people become angry because their self-love is hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They love themselves so much that they are not willing to suffer any hurt, pain, or embarrassment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once their self-love is hurt and they fall into some discomfort, suffering, or embarrassment, they become very angry and lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who have learned this lesson before the Lord know that they live on this earth for the Lord and according to God's grace; they do not live according to their self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They live by His grace and not by their self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They realize that they live and stand because of His mercy and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When they live this way, they do not lose their temper even if they are very justified in doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their self-love has been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, I hope that we realize that all of our temper stems from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the self is not dealt with, temper will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot expect anyone to stop their temper if the self is not dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who do not deal with themselves will find that their temper is still with them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fifth, some brothers and sisters love themselves so much that they care only for their own things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are only interested in their own affairs and have no interest in the affairs of others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They have no interest in helping others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Their conduct and thoughts are centered around themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are the most important persons, and their affairs are the most important affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Their thoughts are on themselves, and whatever they do is for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are busy for themselves, and they care for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, they have no time left for others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If others bother them, they become irritated, and their temper flares up.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Their activities are centered around themselves, and they have no sympathy for others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They love themselves so much that they have no time to sympathize with others.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They are so busy with themselves that they have no strength to bear others' sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many people lose their temper when others infringe upon their self-centered love; they feel disgusted and bothered, and they are impatient and angry.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The root of all anger is in man's self.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we are not self-centered and are able to sympathize with others and if we learn to love others, we will not feel bothered and angry when others trouble us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We will feel that it is a joy to help others and that by helping others we are serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, we must not deal just with our temper, because it is not the root.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must deal with the root of the sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If our self is dealt with, our temper will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The more thoroughly we deal with the self, the more our temper will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sixth, some people love not only themselves, but they have other kinds of love they love things; they love money.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some people are not yet delivered from material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Money and material possessions are precious to them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All kinds of things are precious to them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They have a self that craves things, objects.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The expression of the self in these people is in their love for objects.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If someone comes to their house and breaks an object or loses something that belongs to them, they become very angry because they are hurt; the self which is attached to the objects is hurt, and the result is anger.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The cause of their anger lies within themselves, not in others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you hit a piece of wood with your hand, what kind of sound will you hear?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You will hear the sound of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you knock on the wall, what kind of sound will you hear?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You will hear the sound of the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you knock on a piece of glass, what kind of sound will you hear?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You will hear the sound of glass.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The hand is the same, and the knocking is the same, but the sounds that are produced are different.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>One is wood, and the sound is the sound of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>One is a wall, and the sound is the sound of a wall.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>One is glass, and the sound is the sound of glass.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Different objects have different sounds because the nature of these things is different.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>An outward phenomenon is an expression of the inward nature of something.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Our temper is within; it is not outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If the self is gone, the environment cannot stir up our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>A man loses his temper because there is the element of self within him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As long as the self is within, he will lose his temper given the right environment.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The environment does not produce the temper; it merely brings out the temper that is within.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In conclusion, anger comes from man's self.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As long as a person is angry, it means that a certain aspect of the self has not been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Perhaps many aspects of the self have not been dealt with, or perhaps one particular aspect of the self remains.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Therefore, the extent to which one's temper is dealt with depends on the extent to which the self has been dealt with before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The more thoroughly a man's self is dealt with, the more he is delivered from his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If the self is not clearly dealt with, his temper will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We should not be so foolish as to just deal with our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should remember that the problem of self is much deeper than the problem of temper.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we do not deal with the self, our temper will always be present.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>As we learn to prostrate ourselves before the Lord, we will be enlightened concerning the condition of the self, and God's mercy will bring about many things in our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we have learned some lessons before the Lord, we will bow our head when these things come upon us and say, "Lord, Your arrangements are the best.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It is good that You deal with my self this way.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I submit and I accept these dealings."</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If you do this, your anger will not be vented.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If you do not know the Lord's hand, like a mule that is without understanding, you will think that men or the environment are inflicting these dealings on you.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When your eyes are set on men and the environment, you will be rebellious and angry.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It is useless for a person to deal with his temper without first dealing with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We have to see that the root of temper is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Temper in a Christian is a sign of his refusal to accept the arrangement of the Holy Spirit in his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We have to learn to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit and set ourselves aside.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We have to realize the futility of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If we do these things, the problem of temper will be solved spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Immediately after believing in the Lord, we should deal with the problem of temper.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We should not allow this problem to continue; nor should we deal with it only after we have been Christians for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>A Christian should be one who denies himself.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>He should not be subjective, proud, jealous, self-loving, or self-caring, and he should not love money.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We need to deny the self and realize that everything that comes upon us is under the Spirit's arrangement for our own good.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We should learn to accept everything.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We should not deal with our temper as a symptom, but we should deal with the root of the sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>We cannot deal with our temper without dealing with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Where there is temper, there is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We have a quick temper because we have a quick disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>However, do not think that those who are slow will not lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>They lose their temper as well, except in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>As long as there is the self, there is temper.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Brothers and sisters, in order for us not to lose our temper, we have to deal with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Once we are enlightened concerning the self, we will be delivered from our temper.</S>
