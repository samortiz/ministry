Jehovah Baring His Holy Arm<br>in the Sight of All the Nations,<br>and All the Ends of the Earth<br>Seeing the Salvation of Israel's God</H2><P>Isaiah 52:10 says, "Jehovah has bared His holy arm / In the sight of all the nations, / And all the ends of the earth will see / The salvation of our [Israel's] God." The arm of Jehovah here is the all-inclusive Christ. All the Arab countries surrounding the small country of Israel have been unable to destroy Israel or to gain any of Israel's territory. This is because they have been restricted by the arm of Jehovah, who is Christ as the all-inclusive Servant of Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE REIGNING GOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Your (Israel's) God Reigns!</H2><P>Isaiah 40:9b says, "Say to the cities of Judah, / Here is your God!" This word speaks of God's revealing of Himself in His becoming a man through incarnation. The coming of Jesus is the coming of God. Thus, when Jesus is here, God is here. By comparison, Isaiah 52:7 says, "Your God reigns!" This is the glad tidings, the good news, and the announcing of peace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. A Good News, a Glad Tiding,<br>of Peace and Salvation</H2><P>In the day when Israel returns from their captivity, the sound will go forth, "Your God reigns!" The reigning of God on this earth among men is not a small thing. Today many nations are reigning on the earth. We cannot yet see the reign of God in full. But in the day when the exiled Israel returns to their fathers' land, the watchman will shout, "Your God reigns!" This is truly a glad tiding and a good news to the returned Israel.</P><P>Today the leaders of the nations are very concerned about the economic condition of their countries and whether those under their administration will have an adequate supply of food and other necessities. However, as long as our God reigns among us, we do not need to worry about anything. When God reigns, He also supports, supplies, and provides. When He reigns, He provides the food that His people need. Under His reign there is no lack of food. "Your God reigns" is the good news, the glad tidings of peace and salvation. As long as we have peace and salvation, we can be satisfied; we do not need anything else.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_244.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_246.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 245</div><br></body></html>
