EXERCISE UNTO GODLINESS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Exercise of the Spirit</H2><P>[First Timothy 4:7 says to "exercise yourself unto godliness." 2 Timothy 1:7 tells us, "God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind." Then 2 Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit." When we put all these verses together, we can see that the exercise unto godliness depends on the exercise of the spirit, where the Lord is. If you are going to exercise your self unto godliness, you have to know how to exercise your spirit because the very God is in your spirit. These verses are the scriptural ground for the exercise of the spirit.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. More Profitable than Bodily Exercise</H2><P>[In the Greek text of the New Testament, the word for "exercise" is the same as the English word "gymnastics." In the days when the Apostle Paul wrote these epistles, gymnastic exercises were practiced by the Greeks. Therefore, the historical background of the word used by Paul was the exercise of bodily gymnastics. Even today, people are learning more and more how to exercise their body for their physical health. However, the Apostle Paul utilized this word to stress the vital need of another kind of gymnastics, another kind of exercise that is not related to the physical body. This kind of gymnastics pertains solely to the matter of godliness.</P><P>Perhaps some brothers have daily exercises or gymnastics for their body. Well, this is good, for Paul said that bodily exercise has some profit. It is good, but only to a certain degree. However, Paul describes another kind of gymnastics which is good forever&#151;both for today and for eternity! He says that this second kind of gymnastics gives us profit for the life today and for the life in eternity. Therefore, we should pay more attention to this other gymnastics, the exercise of our spirit.]</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 3: Two Spirits-Two Spirits - the Divine Spirit and the Human Spirit &nbsp; pg 65</div><br></body></html>
