<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As All the Divine Attributes and<br>All the Human Virtues</H2><P>Christ is all the divine attributes and all the human virtues. Whatever God is in His being is an attribute. God is holy and God is righteous; therefore, holiness and righteousness are two of His divine attributes. He is love, light, life, redemption, salvation, power, and strength. All of these items are divine attributes. Attributes are different from virtues. Attributes are the things which belong to us as our possession; virtues are the things we possess that are expressed for others' appreciation. God is love. When love is expressed for others' appreciation, it becomes a virtue. According to 1 Peter 2:9, we are a royal priesthood to tell out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. Christ is all of the divine attributes and the human virtues.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As the One Who Is Unsearchable and<br>Untraceable in His Riches</H2><P>Christ is rich and His riches are unsearchable and untraceable (Eph. 3:8), indicating that He Himself is unsearchable and untraceable.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As the One Who Is Sufficient in His Grace</H2><P>He is also sufficient in His grace (2 Cor. 12:9). The grace of Christ is sufficient. This grace is the processed Triune God given to us for our enjoyment and supply. In such a grace Christ is sufficient to meet our various kinds of need.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As the One Who Gives the Spirit Not by Measure</H2><P>Because Christ is unsearchable, He gives the Spirit not by measure (John 3:34). This means that the Spirit given by Him is also unsearchable as He is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As the Life-Giving Spirit&#151;the Spirit</H2><P>Christ is the life-giving Spirit&#151;the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). Christ is not only the Son embodied to be a man, but has also become the Spirit in His resurrection; hence, He is the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As Our Life</H2><P>Christ is our life (Col. 3:4a). He is the divine life (John 11:25; 14:6) coming into us to be our life; hence, we live by Him (John 14:19).</P>
