   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Thirty THE CITIES OF REFUGE Scripture: Num 35; Deut 19; Josh 20:1-6 It is so easy for man to sin The cities of refuge were set up for those who killed any person unwittingly.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Killing unwittingly means killing ignorantly, unconsciously, or unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today man does many things unwittingly and unconsciously offends the law in his ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some might be teaching, helping the poor, working toward a promotion, or earning money, yet unconsciously in doing these things they may be committing sins which lead to death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Give some examples to illustrate the meaning of killing unwittingly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not think that committing sins is a light thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please remember that a murderer must give his life in recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though he did the killing unwittingly, he would still have to die.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s saving way During that time God set up six cities of refuge in Israel, three west of the Jordan River, and three east of it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Three times two equals six.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Three is the number that represents the Triune God, and two represents witness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Three on each side of the Jordan were for the convenience of those who killed unwittingly, so that they could flee into one of them easily.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there had been only one city of refuge, it would have been more difficult for the guilty ones to reach that city.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Triune God comes to the eastern world and to the western world to save people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No matter where you are today, a city of refuge is close to you, because the cities of refuge on this earth are God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever you discover that you deserve death, just come to this Triune God and you will be under His protection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who fled into the city of refuge could not be released until the death of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This typifies that we could only be released by the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore fleeing into the city of refuge is fleeing into the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The aspect of the city of refuge shows we are escaping.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The aspect of the death of Christ shows we are released.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The city shows God is our escape, the death of Christ, our release.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way of salvation Run fast.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No doubt the city of refuge is close to you, but you have to run fast, lest the avenger catch you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Running fast is to believe quickly, or else you will have no time to flee when the avenger comes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whatever you have done, as long as you killed others unwittingly, you have to leave that spot as quickly as possible and run into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Running fast is to believe the Lord quickly, for the Lord is the city of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Receive the death of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those in the cities of refuge could not be released until the death of the high priest, or the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So you must acknowledge that the Lord has died for you.</S>
