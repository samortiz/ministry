   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SON BEING IN THE FATHER AND THE FATHER BEING IN THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 10 the Lord continued, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Over the past eighteen hundred years this truth has been gradually neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the theologians in the early centuries considered this matter to be quite important. they even coined the theological term coinherence, meaning that you are in me, and I am in you, and we are in one another mutually.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Christianity's theology today, many teach the doctrine of the Trinity, and some advocate the use of the term coexistence, but not many have the boldness to use the term coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nonetheless, in early Christian theology both coexistence and coinherence were used.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a tremendously great matter: the Son is in the Father, the Father is in the Son, and the Son and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why the Lord asked Philip how it could be that he had seen the Son yet had not seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE SON SPEAKING WHILE THE FATHER WAS WORKING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, the Lord said, "The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works" v. 10b . This simply means that the Son speaks while the Father works.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps some will say, "Is this not the same as what the Chinese refer to as playing shuang-huang.Shuang-huang is a Chinese variety act featuring two performers, one of whom speaks while the other acts out the gestures Trans.&gt; Shuang-huang involves two persons, whereas here there is only one person: this One is He yet "I."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"I" speaks while He works.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Son speaks, which is to express something outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the Son does not speak according to Himself, but the Father who abides in the Son does His works.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that the Son speaks outwardly while the Father works inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The One who is outside speaks, while the One who is inside works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, are They two persons?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can say that They are two yet one, one yet two.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, it is not that there is one who speaks without and another who works within.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The One who works within is in the One who speaks without; that is, the Father is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the same time, the One who speaks without is in the One who works within; that is, the Son is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, the two are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Their coinherence is an unfathomable mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE FATHER AND THE SON COINHERING FOR THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ultimately, we all have to admit that we really do not know all that we think we know.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, there is truly such a fact that the Son is in the Father, the Father is in the Son, and the two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This has been clearly shown in the Bible in black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Though They are one, there is still the aspect of Their being two; furthermore, though there is the aspect of Their being two, They are one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the mystery of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the reason for the coinhering of the Father and the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is for the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If God were not triune, if the Son did not speak outwardly while the Father worked inwardly there would be no possibility for God to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, God's dispensing is altogether a story of the "Word."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, my speaking to you is a kind of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am full of knowledge within; what should I do if I want to infuse you with all my knowledge?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I went and found a doctor, he would have no way to inject my knowledge into you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The most simple and effective way is for me to speak to you directly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more I speak, the more I transmit all the knowledge within me into you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, speaking is a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the same way, when you work for the Lord, you need to learn to speak for the Lord so that you can dispense Him into others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In ancient times when people engaged in war, they relied mainly on the weapons in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, the Chinese say that a soldier who is skillful with his weapon can defend a key position single-handedly and that even ten thousand men cannot match him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a soldier is not skillful with his weapon, he cannot fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we want to fight the battle, we must have a weapon in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our "weapon" is the word, and we all should be experts at using this weapon.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As experts, we should be able to strike more than just the air.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, we all need to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What kind of training do we need?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need the training of infusing: we need to be infused with God's economy, and the more we are infused the better.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then one day we all will be able to do the same work of infusing God's economy into others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John 14, 15, and 16 are all on the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, and this dispensing depends on speaking.</S>
