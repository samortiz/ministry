<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO HAVE<br />
PROPER CHRISTIAN MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Deut. 16:13, 16-17; 1 Cor. 14:26</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING A CORPORATE LIFE</h2>
<p>Throughout the New Testament Christians are likened to sheep (Matt. 10:16; 18:12; 26:31; John 10:1-16, 26-28; 21:15-17; Rom. 8:36; Heb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 2:25). This is an indication that Christians are people who need to be together. Sheep are different from dogs and cats because they are always in a flock. A dog or a cat can be alone, but a sheep must always be in a flock. The life of a sheep is a life in the flock. In order for us to be normal Christians, we must join together with other believers. Just as sheep cannot live independently of the flock, we cannot be independent or individual. We must have a Body life, a church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PATTERN OF THE EARLY CHURCH</h2>
<p>Our need as Christians is to come together with other Christians, but when we do so, we must come together according to the revelation and teaching of the early church as unveiled in the New Testament. When the early Christians came together during the time of the apostles, they did not have any regulations, forms, or rituals. Rather, they came together in a simple way to meet and to fellowship. In the book of Acts there were no regulations, forms, or rituals. All we see are saved persons, who had been filled with the Holy Spirit, coming together to fellowship and to share, exalt, and glorify the Lord with one another. This was their church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEGRADED CONDITION OF TODAY&rsquo;S CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>The early church met in such a simple and living way, but the church eventually fell from this genuinely spiritual condition into a man-made condition of having religious &ldquo;services.&rdquo; The religious services that take place in Christianity today are not spiritual. In Christianity the nature of the Christian meeting has changed and become degraded. Suppose a person who lives by the Lord, walks in spirit, contacts the Lord in his spirit, and is filled with the Holy Spirit were to come to a religious service in today&rsquo;s Christianity. He would feel that this religious service does not match his spirit. His spirit would be looking for one thing, but the religious service would offer him something else. It would not match his spirit, meet his need, fit his spiritual condition, or satisfy the longing of his spirit. This proves that there is something wrong with these so-called Christian services. They are formal and religious and are filled with regulations, forms, and rituals.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PROPER CHRISTIAN MEETING</h2>
<p>What then is a proper Christian meeting? A proper Christian meeting is one in which saints come together to exercise their spirit apart from regulations, forms, rituals, and all other religious bonds and hindrances. In a proper Christian meeting there is a spiritual order and a divine atmosphere of decency, but there are no religious bonds, hindrances, or frustrations. In such a meeting the attendants express what is in their spirit and what they sense in their spirit. They also display what they have experienced of Christ in their daily life. In such a proper Christian meeting the brothers and sisters who come together are like burning wood. Each of them has been set on fire, and each of them also sets others on fire. They burn one another like burning wood that is piled together. After each meeting, each saint has been burned and is burning. When they go home, they burn their families; when they go to work, they burn their colleagues; and when they go to a restaurant, they even burn the people in the restaurant. They are always being burned and burning others. This is what a proper Christian meeting is like.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO HAVE PROPER CHRISTIAN MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Forsaking Regulations, Forms, Rituals,<br />
and Everything Foreign to the Scriptures</h2>
<p>In order to have proper Christian meetings, when we come together, we must forsake regulations, forms, rituals, programs, and every other thing that is not in the Scriptures. In 1932, after I had prayed to the Lord for several months, the Lord began a ministry, a work, in my hometown. At that time many of us felt that there was something wrong with Christianity, so we made a decision to forsake everything of Christianity. We received the Lord as our Savior and all-inclusive Lord, we fully received the gospel that had been preached to us, and we absolutely received everything in the Bible. We received these three items absolutely, but outside of these three things we did not receive anything that Christianity brought to us. We realized that the Lord is right, that the gospel is right, and that the Scriptures are right, but we also realized that Christianity is wrong. We made a clear differentiation between these three items and Christianity. In fact, we made a list of all the things in Christianity and examined them one by one to see if we could find these things in the Scriptures. Eventually, we had to cross nearly every item off our list and let it go because we could not find it in the Scriptures. For example, where in the Bible does it say that it is necessary to have a pastor to take the lead in a Christian meeting? You cannot find such a thing. Furthermore, where in the Bible does it say that when the believers come together, they should all sit in pews and wait for a pastor or an elder to read the Scriptures, pray, give a sermon, and then give a benediction? Nowhere in the Bible does it say this. We checked the things that we saw in Christianity against the Scriptures, and one by one we crossed nearly everything off our list.</p>
<p>After we crossed nearly everything off our list and gave up Christianity entirely as a religious system, we did not know what to do, so we simply came together. Our meetings at that time began in a variety of ways. In my home province a group of saints composed primarily of medical students began to meet together. These students had been saved and led to know the Lord in a living way. As a result, they had the desire to meet, and they began to do so. Since they did not have any place in which to meet, they went to a cemetery. Most cemeteries in China are located outside of town at the base or top of a mountain, so these young believers went to the outskirts of town to meet together in a simple way in a cemetery. In many cemeteries in China, each gravesite has a small pyramid next to it along with a stone table that people use for offering sacrifices to their ancestors. When these young believers came together in the cemetery, they sat down on the ground, put the bread and the wine on one of these stone tables, and began to meet together. At that time none of us knew what to do or how to practice the church life. The only thing that we knew was that we had to give up all the regulations, forms, and rituals, because these things cannot be found in the Scriptures.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
