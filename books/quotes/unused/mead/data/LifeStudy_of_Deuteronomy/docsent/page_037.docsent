   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF DEUTERONOMY MESSAGE EIGHT THE REHEARSAL OF THE LAW 3 Scripture Reading: Deut 9:1-8; 10:12-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will cover the general advices and warnings found in 9:1 10:22.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>L. Moses Charging the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That They Should Know That Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Their God as a Consuming Fire Would Destroy</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>the Nations and Drive Them Out from before Them</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 9:3 Moses charged the children of Israel, saying, "Know therefore today that Jehovah your God is the One crossing over before you as a consuming fire; it is He who will destroy them and it is He who will subdue them before you, so that you may dispossess them and destroy them quickly, as Jehovah has said to you."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although Jehovah is a loving God, here He is revealed as a consuming fire that will destroy the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verses 4 through 6 we see that God would dispossess the nations, not because the children of Israel were righteous but because the nations were wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 4 Moses continued his charge: "Do not say in your heart when Jehovah your God drives them out from before you, Because of my righteousness, Jehovah has brought me in to possess this land.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, it is because of the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah is about to dispossess them from before you."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, God's dispossessing the nations was not due to the uprightness of the heart of His people; it was due to the wickedness of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that even the wickedness of the nations serves God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 7 Moses went on to say, "Remember, do not forget, that you made Jehovah your God furious in the wilderness; from the day that you came forth from the land of Egypt up until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here Moses reminded the people that their history was a history of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From the time they came out of Egypt, they had been rebellious continually.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The forty years in the wilderness were years of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose some among the new generation of the children of Israel said, "This rebellion was not our fault it was the mistake of our fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were the ones who rebelled and died in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That rebellion had nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are different."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To any who might have spoken in this way, Moses might have replied, "Do not say that you are different from your fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are sons of rebels, and rebels can only bring forth rebels.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as a serpent cannot bring forth a lamb, so a rebel cannot bring forth one who is obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You need to realize that, as sons of rebels, you also are rebels."</S>
