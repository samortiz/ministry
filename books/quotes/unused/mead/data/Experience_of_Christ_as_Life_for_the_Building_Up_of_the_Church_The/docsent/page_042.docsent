   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE EXPERIENCING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN SECOND CORINTHIANS 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:6, 8, 17-18; 13:14; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 6:63; 5:21</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have pointed out that in 1 Corinthians there is mostly the doctrine concerning Christ, but in the second Epistle there is the experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous chapter, we began to speak about the aspects of the Spirit in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whatever is spoken there concerning the Spirit is not in the way of doctrine but in the way of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It tells us something richer and finer than 1 Corinthians does.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1 Corinthians the Spirit is the revealing Spirit, the gift-dispensing Spirit, and the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But 2 Corinthians tells us first that the Spirit is the anointing Spirit 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The anointing is richer and finer than the revealing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose a mother just showed her daughter food and did not serve her the food.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I prefer not the showing, the revealing, but the feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever the Lord reveals, He anoints into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The revealing is for seeing, and the anointing is for enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today's Christians are so much for knowing, for seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They like to listen to messages from good speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul said that when the decline of the church worsens, people "will not tolerate the healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears" 2 Tim 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul told the Corinthians that they might have ten thousand guides, or teachers, but not many fathers 1 Cor 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Teachers pass on knowledge; fathers impart life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What we need today is not teachers but fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those with itching ears like to heap up teachers to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They like only to know, to see.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But after the seeing in 1 Corinthians, we must come to the anointing in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit in 2 Corinthians is not the teaching Spirit but the anointing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Holy Spirit anoints us with the divine essence, just like a painter paints a house with the essence of paint.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit anoints us with the essence of God's nature, with the substance of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more He anoints us, the more of God we have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have also seen that the Spirit is the sealing Spirit 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The anointing brings in the essence, and the sealing shapes what the anointing brings in into a definite form and image.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you mark a piece of paper with a seal, there is a definite form, an image, on that paper.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The anointing Spirit brings in the riches of God's fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the sealing Spirit shapes them into a form which gives people an impression.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you are sealed by the Spirit, you have the image of God, the impression of God, and the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The anointing Spirit brings in all the riches of the Godhead so that we have something substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then the sealing Spirit follows to make this substance into a form so that we have the image, impression, and likeness of God.</S>
