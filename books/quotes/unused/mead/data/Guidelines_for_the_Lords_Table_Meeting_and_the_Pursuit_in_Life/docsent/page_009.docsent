   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE BEARING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 14:23-26 says, If therefore the whole church comes together in one place,...indeed God is among you...Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let all things be done for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows the proper situation of a normal church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Strictly speaking, the Christian life is a meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Much of the grace a Christian receives is in the meetings, and much of the work the Lord does is also in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Matthew 18:20 says, For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, Hebrews 10:25 says, Not abandoning our own assembling together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the Christian life is a meeting life and much of the Lord s work is carried out through the meetings, we must regard Christian meetings as an important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>PRAYING FOR AND VISITING THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to pray for the brothers and sisters in our small group meeting and visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It would be best if we could prepare a prayer record, with the names of the saints in our group.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should pray for at least one person each day and cover everyone in the group every week.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the same time, based on our burden, we can fellowship with them in order to gain a better understanding of their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we can pray for them to have a heart for the Lord, and we can help them fulfill their desire and goal toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, prayer is of supreme importance, and it is very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In addition to praying for the saints, we can also fellowship and talk with them before and after the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the Lord leads, we can even visit them during the week.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may also write them to share what we have heard and enjoyed in the meetings, thereby keeping in touch with them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should be diligent in these matters before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If every brother and sister is willing to do these things, they are doing a good work that is valuable in the Lord s sight and acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>LEARNING TO BEAR RESPONSIBILITY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>FOR THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Besides praying for and fellowshipping with the saints, in the church life we should also learn to bear responsibility for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It will be difficult for a meeting to have the rich presence of the Lord if we do not bear responsibility for the meeting by exercising our spirit and living according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the Holy Spirit cannot find channels in a meeting, the saints whom we bring to the meeting will not be moved or benefited.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, after one or two meetings they will no longer come.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This will be a big loss to them, and a great loss to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The brothers and sisters in a small group meeting must see that they should not only pray for those in their group and fellowship with them, but they should also learn to bear responsibility along with the elders for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Christianity, pastors and preachers take the lead and are responsible for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone who has been to a Sunday service in the denominations knows that there are pastors who lead the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Arrangements are made beforehand as to who will choose the hymns, who will lead the singing, who will be the first to pray, who will be the second to pray, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The rest of the believers are merely spectators; they watch what others do and listen to what others say, but they themselves do not bear any responsibility for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This may be practiced in a gospel meeting or a message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, to practice this in the Lord s table, fellowship, and prayer meetings is altogether contrary to the nature of meetings as revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the saints should come together and follow the leading of the Holy Spirit for the Lord s table, fellowship, and prayer meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As described in 1 Corinthians 14, some may have a psalm, a teaching, or a revelation; we should function according to the spirit so that others will see that God is indeed among us v. 25 . This kind of church meeting is a meeting according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Meetings for preaching the gospel or for ministering the word may be taken care of by a few brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But when the whole church is gathered together for exhortation or for the exercise of gifts, all the saints should participate by following the spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The brothers and sisters should follow the spirit to bear the burden and responsibility for the meeting; otherwise, it will be like coming to a hall of worship to merely attend a meeting and to let the pastors lead the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must know that if we do not bear the burden for the Lord s table, fellowship, and prayer meetings, it will be difficult for the newly saved ones to begin a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, at the Lord s table meeting, if none of the elders or responsible brothers who are sitting in the front row select a hymn, the meeting will not begin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This shows that we are not bearing the responsibility for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the elders would not call a hymn, we would simply sit there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is as if we are behaving as guests invited to a meal instead of cooking it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A meeting should not have to wait for a responsible brother to call a hymn before it can begin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Where does this practice come from?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It comes from our unwillingness to bear responsibility for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Never think that the first two rows are reserved for responsible brothers, elders, and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we come to a meeting to pray and worship God, we all have an equal standing; we are all brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes for convenience in the service, the brother who makes announcements may sit in the front, but this is not always necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The elders can scatter themselves among the other brothers, sitting with them before God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When it is time to begin the meeting, all the brothers should bear the responsibility for selecting hymns, thereby sharing the burden of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the elders and responsible brothers would not take the lead, the whole meeting will be left without anyone to bear the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This indicates that we have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to the principle in 1 Corinthians 14, all of the brothers and sisters should bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this way, the saints who are newly saved will see that the meeting belongs to everyone and not merely to the elders or a few responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Spontaneously, they will also pick up this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus, we all have a great responsibility in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we are in a small group meeting, we should share the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should all select hymns and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then all the saints who attend the meeting will realize that the meeting is not merely the responsibility of a few responsible brothers but of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, it is easy to carry on the meeting in a healthy way.</S>
