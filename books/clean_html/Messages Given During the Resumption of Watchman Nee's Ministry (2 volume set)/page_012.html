<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Having an Ambition to Obey God Absolutely</H2><P>Many Christians walk according to their own tastes. This is like those who have a sweet tooth devouring sweet things when they see them and rejecting spicy things that are served to them. A person can be fussy with food, but he cannot be a Christian in this way. A person can be a "pew-Christian," a "Sunday-going Christian," but such a one will never afford God the way to go on. You may say that you are willing and that you hope the Lord will help your weakness. God will surely not listen to such a prayer because by praying in this way you have opened a back door already; you have made provision for yourself to disobey already. You should have the ambition to say, "Lord! I do not need Your help. As long as You give me a feeling, I will obey."</P><P>The gospel has been preached in Hong Kong for over a hundred years. Here are over a million people. But too few people are saved. Even among us tonight, we have only one to two hundred people. What is the reason for this slow increase? It is a small thing for you to answer my question today, but how would you answer the Lord that day at the judgment seat? There is no need to wait for that day; even today, it is hard for us to give an answer to ourselves. There is no need for those who do not obey their inner feelings to vindicate themselves; there is no need for them to tell God that they are serving Him. There are many who have proclaimed themselves to be believers, and it is not necessary for you to tell others that you are zealous. However, if you truly give yourselves to the Lord, you will see many people saved through you. If you want to love the Lord, love Him in an absolute way. If you want to love the world, love it all the way. A man can only be one person at a time; he cannot be two persons at the same time. He cannot love the Lord and love the world at the same time. Some people are eight different persons all at one time; their hearts are in eight different places. One place may be their children. Another place may be their money. It is better for these people to put their hearts in one place and to love God with a single heart.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Being Simple, Not Analyzing,<br>and Walking Step by Step<br>according to the Feelings of the Spirit</H2><P>In order to be a Christian, a person must be simple. As soon as a feeling comes, we should obey. As soon as another feeling comes, we should obey again. This is the Christian way. You do not need to worry if this or that is wrong. Even if you are wrong, you need not be afraid. As long as you feel peaceful in your heart, you can go on. As long as you remain simple, and as long as you are for God and are pure toward Him, you do not need to analyze too much. You have to realize that sometimes God gives us uneasy feelings within; He also makes us uncomfortable. Whenever you feel uncomfortable about something, do not do it. If you practice this, after a while, your emotions, desires, and thoughts will become one with God, and spontaneously God will fill you up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Studying the Bible<br>to Allow God's Word to Check<br>the Feeling in Your Spirit</H2><P>At the same time, you must study the Bible thoroughly. This allows the Holy Spirit to have a chance to enlighten you. The Bible confirms our feelings and tells us whether they are right or wrong. To be a Christian, a person must not only walk according to the teachings of the Bible, but walk according to the inner feeling. A weighty and proper Christian is one who reads the Bible, on the one hand, and walks according to the inner feelings, on the other hand. If you do not walk according to your feelings, you are merely a dead Christian. We must all learn to take care of this crucial matter: to go along with the inner feeling.</P>
