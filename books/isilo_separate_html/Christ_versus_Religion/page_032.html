God took away Moses and Elijah. In this sense, when the Lord comes, God takes away the Old Testament. When your dear ones are away from home, they send you photos and snapshots of themselves. That is what the Lord did in sending Moses and Elijah. But now our dear One is with us. Do we still need His pictures or letters? If we do, it means that we care more for them than for Himself. This would be an offense to Jesus. So many so-called fundamentalists today just care for reading the Bible; they do not care for the presence of Christ. They care for the letters, but they do not care for the living Christ. We have seen that Christ is versus religion. But now I have the boldness to say that, in a sense, Christ is also versus the Scriptures. What I mean is that Christ is versus the Scriptures as dead letters.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, you must see no man save Jesus only; you must hear Him, not the law nor the prophets, neither Moses nor Elijah. Jesus is today's Moses and He is the present Elijah. He is the Lawgiver, and He is the One who predicts. Go along with whatever He predicts, and you will have the ability to keep His commandments and fulfill what He says. Today's recovery is the recovery of the living presence of the living Christ, not the scriptural teachings, nor this or that. Whatever He says is right. Whatever He predicts will be fulfilled. Hallelujah!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Applying both Christ and the church</H2><P>I really like the Lord's way. The Lord told Peter to go fishing and find a coin which would be good "for me and thee." The Lord took care not only of the Head, but also of the Body. He took care not only of Himself, but also of His members. Praise the Lord, the Head and the Body always go together.</P><P>Today we need the revelation, the vision, and even more the application that we may practice all that we have seen concerning Christ and the church, the Head and the Body. We must not only take care of the Head, but also of the Body. The coin was good for the Head and the Body. May the Lord show us more and more and bring us through not only the revelation and the vision, but also the application. When all the tribute men come to us, may we learn to apply both Christ and the church to our circumstances, not just in doctrine or teaching, but in practicality. The Lord be merciful and gracious to us all.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
