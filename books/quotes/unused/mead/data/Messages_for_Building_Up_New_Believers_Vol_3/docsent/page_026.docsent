   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT ASCETICISM I. THE ORIGIN OF ASCETICISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All unsaved persons have certain ideals.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although a person may live in sin, he still cherishes certain lofty ideals.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has a concept about what constitutes a holy living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although he cannot live that way, he considers it as his standard for a holy living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is interesting to note that although many unbelievers indulge in sin and lust, they have an idealistic concept of what constitutes a holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They think that if they can achieve such a state one day, they will be holy persons and will be beyond earthly contamination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All intellectual people have an idealistic picture of what constitutes a holy living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even with less educated and less sophisticated people, there is a concept that a person is good and noble if he achieves a certain standard.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Being of the World, Not of Christianity</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We brought this kind of thought into the church when we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have the concept that as Christians we should now achieve the ideal living which we failed to achieve before.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past we lived in sin, grew up with lust, and had no power over the weaknesses of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now that we have believed in the Lord, we should live out an ideal life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But here lies man s basic frustration: He thinks that he can live his version of an ideal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He does not realize that this ideal life belongs altogether to the world; it has nothing to do with being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Please bear in mind that even though many people have become Christians, their standard is still a heathen standard.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their ideal life is a heathen ideal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They bring their philosophies into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such philosophies pose quite a problem to a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A new believer must deal with this matter in a clear and definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Originating from a Desire to Be Free</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>from Lustful Living</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is this ideal life that man aspires to?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Simply put, a man bound by sin is filled with all kinds of lust and greed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although he can do nothing about them, he yearns to be free from them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, his heart is drawn toward material things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, he yearns to be delivered from these material things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man s ideals are always based on what he cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more he is bound by something, the more he yearns for the opposite thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more lusts a man has, the more his ideals are shaped by the desire for deliverance from these lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more a man lusts for material wealth, the more he aspires to be freed from material wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The whole world is filled with asceticism of one form or another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please bear in mind that asceticism is not man s rule of conduct, but an ideal that he cherishes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With this ideal, man mollifies himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This ideal affords man a goal, an excuse to forget about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He sets a certain standard and goal, telling himself that if he attains to this standard, he will have reached the ultimate pinnacle of attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the source of asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Almost all unbelievers yield to lust, but in their hearts they admire those who are freed from lust and from material bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, asceticism is a standard and an ideal that an unbeliever, that is, a man without Christ, sets before himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>ASCETICISM HAVING NO PLACE IN CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After a person is saved, he subconsciously carries this thought of asceticism into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Though he never practiced it in the past, he admired those who practiced it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Gentiles indulge in lusts on the one hand and admire asceticism on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They crave material things, yet they admire those who are free from material things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They cannot be a certain way, yet they admire those who are that way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After they become Christians, they carry their privately cherished ascetic ideals into the church, thinking that it is the duty of a saved person to practice asceticism.</S>
