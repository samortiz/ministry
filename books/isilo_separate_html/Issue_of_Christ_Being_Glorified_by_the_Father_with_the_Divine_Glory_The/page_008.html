GLORIFICATION TRANSFERRING CHRIST FROM THE STAGE OF HIS INCARNATION INTO THE STAGE OF HIS INCLUSION</H2><P>Such a glorification is a transfer, transferring Christ from the stage of His incarnation into the stage of His inclusion, in which He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</P><P>If we glorify a certain person in the sense of praising and exalting him, this kind of glorification does not transfer him. No matter how much he is glorified by being exalted and praised, he remains the same. However, God's glorification of Christ transferred Christ from one stage to another stage. He was in the first stage, the stage of incarnation, but He was transferred out of that stage into the second stage, the stage of inclusion. In the stage of inclusion He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</P><P>Christ's being glorified was a drastic change not only in His condition and situation but also in His nature, element, and essence. If we glorify someone by exalting him, we may change him in his condition and situation, but we do not change him in his nature, element, and essence. Because he is now praised instead of despised, his condition and situation are changed, but his nature, element, and essence remain the same. The glorification of Christ was very different. We need to see that Christ's being glorified by the Father was a drastic change not merely in condition and situation but also in His nature, in His element, and in His essence. This was the release of the glory of Christ's divinity through the baptism of His death on the cross.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
