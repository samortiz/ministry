<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Christ's Young Men Being to Him<br>like the Dew from the Womb of the Morning</H2><P>"Your young men will be to You/Like the dew from the womb of the morning" (v. 3b). This indicates that, on the one hand, Christ likes to see the splendor of our consecration; on the other hand, He desires the dew that comes from the womb of the morning. Christ enjoys seeing the splendor of those who offer themselves to Him as freewill offerings, but, even more important, He still needs some dew to water Him. Even Christ needs the watering. He needs us to be the dew that waters Him.</P><P>According to the poetry here, this dew comes from "the womb of the morning." We need to enter into this womb to be conceived as the dew with which to water Christ. I believe that this involves the morning watch. If we do not rise up early in the morning, we will miss the opportunity to enter into the womb of the morning to be made dew for Christ's watering. Instead of being watered, He will be dry and we also will be dry. I hope that we all, especially the young people, will see that here Christ likens Himself to a plant that needs the mild, soft, gentle dew. May we respond to Him by saying, "Lord Jesus, I want to be the dew conceived and produced by the womb of the morning for You to be watered."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God Swearing without Repenting<br>to Ordain Christ a Priest Forever<br>according to the Order of Melchizedec</H2><P>"Jehovah has sworn/And He will not change:/You are a Priest forever/According to the order of Melchizedek" (v. 4; Heb. 5:6, 10). The Hebrew word translated "change" here may also be rendered "repent." Christ is not only the King with power and authority, as indicated in verse 2; He is also the High Priest, as revealed in verse 4. Today we need Christ not only as our King but also as our Priest to pray for us and to take care of our case before God.</P><P>Christ's ministry is of two sections. The first section was His ministry on earth, and the second section is His ministry in the heavens. In His earthly ministry He did many things. Now, having completed the first section of His ministry, Christ in His ascension is carrying out the second, the heavenly, section of His ministry. This includes both His kingship and His priesthood. As the King He has the scepter signifying power and authority to rule over the earth and to manage our affairs, and as the High Priest He is praying for us and taking care of our case.</P>
