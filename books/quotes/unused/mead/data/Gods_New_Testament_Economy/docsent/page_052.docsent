   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Father Strengthening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Members of the Body through the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>for Christ to Make His Home in Their Heart</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Ephesians 3:14-19 Paul prayed that through the Spirit the Father would strengthen the members of the Body into their inner man, that Christ may make His home in their hearts, that they may be strong to apprehend with all the members the breadth, length, height, and depth of Christ, that they may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Again, this is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 2:18 tells us that we have access unto the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Ephesians 3:14-19 indicates that Christ comes to make home in our hearts from the Father through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is two-way traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In one Spirit, through Christ, we go unto the Father, which means we come to Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the other hand, through the Spirit, Christ comes from God to make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is making His home in our hearts that we may know His breadth, length, height, and depth, His unlimited dimensions, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This God is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul prayed that the Father through the Spirit would strengthen us into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our heart, that we may be filled unto the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Paul s prayer we see four divine titles: the Father, the Spirit, Christ, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These four titles do not refer to four different persons but to the same One, the same complete Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul had such a vision of God s New Testament economy that even in his prayer he had the Triune God in view.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the members need to be strengthened by the Father, through the Spirit, into the inner man, in order that Christ may make His home in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This will enable all the members to apprehend this wonderful Person together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our goal is to apprehend together this wonderful Person in His unlimited dimensions that we may be filled with the Triune God unto His full expression.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Colossians 2:9 we are told that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When this Christ comes to make His home in our heart, He comes with all the fullness of God, and He imparts to us all the fullness of God to such an extent that we become the fullness of God, the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ wants to make home in our hearts, to fill us with His riches to such an extent that we, the church, may become the full expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is to be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the riches are in God Himself they are His riches, but when the riches of God are expressed they become His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth, the unlimited dimensions of Christ, requires all the saints, not individually but corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No one can tell how broad is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, and how deep is the depth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are the universal dimensions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our Christ is immeasurable and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the saints must work together to apprehend the universal, unlimited dimensions of Christ, that they may be filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Unto in Greek means resulting in. We are filled resulting in the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is wrong to translate this word into with or by.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not with or by the fullness of God, but unto the fullness of God, resulting in the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Christ makes His home in your heart, occupying your entire inner being, this means that Christ is filling you with all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every corner, every avenue of our mind, our emotion, our will, and every inward part of our being is being occupied by this unsearchably rich Christ until we are filled resulting in the fullness, the expression, of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A cup may contain some water and it may be rich in water, but there is no expression of the water because the cup is not completely full of water.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the cup is filled with water until it is overflowing, this is the fullness, the expression, of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you only have the riches without the fullness, there is no expression.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all need to let Christ with all His riches make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The heart is a composition of our inner being, consisting of the mind, the will, the emotion, and the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The heart, therefore, is composed of all the parts of the soul plus one part of the spirit, the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Christ with all His unsearchable riches makes home in our heart, this means that He is occupying every part of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His filling us from within with all His riches results in one thing the full expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Members of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesians 4:3 tells us that the members of the Body should keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit is the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not act, move, work, or speak without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must be people living, moving, walking, and having our being in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a husband and wife are not moving, living, and acting in the Spirit, there is no way that they can be one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the husband and wife move, act, live, and even breathe in the Spirit, they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have learned a secret in marriage life that it is better for the couple not to talk if they are not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a couple is not in the Spirit, when the husband says west the wife will say east.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When I was not in the Spirit, I was fearful of talking to my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I was in the Spirit and she was in the Spirit we had the full freedom to talk and we were one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must remember that we are one only when we are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we are outside the Spirit it is better not to talk to keep the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The only way to keep the oneness of the Spirit is to be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no other way.</S>
