As you are reading this message, you need to consider it in the light of your experience. According to your experience, is not the Christian life a life of having the Triune God dispensed into us and mingling Himself with us? While the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us, He mingles Himself with us. I can testify that sometimes this experience of the Triune God dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us makes us beside ourselves with joy. Through this dispensing and mingling we may be so happy in the Lord that we may momentarily forget where we are and who we are. It may seem that we are not on earth but in the heavens. Every Christian should have this kind of experience in the Triune God. If you have never experienced the Triune God in this way, your experience as a Christian is below normal, below the standard.<p>When we experience the Triune God dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us, we realize that in Him we are excellent, wonderful persons. A married sister who experiences the Triune God in this way will be an excellent wife, and a married brother with this enjoyment will be an excellent husband. How marvelous it is to experience the Triune God dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us! It may seem to some that this is a dream. If this is a dream, then I would say that all Christians need such a dream. If you have never experienced this dream, you may be a religious Christian, but you are not a Christian according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy. In other words, in your experience you do not have the dispensing and the mingling of the Triune God. We can testify that this experience of the Triune God makes us God-men, persons filled with the Triune God and immersed in Him.<p>Chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John reveal the Triune God. According to these chapters, the Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit comes to us and enters into us. When the Spirit enters into us, we experience the dispensing of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and also the mingling with the Triune God.<p>There are times when the experience of the dispensing of the Triune God and of being mingled with Him should cause us to be beside ourselves with joy. We should not remain serious and sober in a natural way, but we should have the wonderful enjoyment of the Triune God. Those who in their experience know what it means to be beside themselves with joy because of the dispensing of the Triune God into them cause me to be very happy and encouraged concerning the future of the Lord&#8217;s recovery. I am especially happy to see young people filled with the Lord and enjoying Him. Oh, let us all enjoy the Triune God dispensing Himself into us and being mingled with us! This dispensing and mingling will bring us into an ecstasy in Him. It will take us out of ourselves and cause us to be full of joy in the Lord. Using electricity as an illustration, we may also say that the more we experience the dispensing of the Triune God and are mingled with Him, the more we shall be &#8220;electrified,&#8221; the more we shall be &#8220;charged&#8221; with divine electricity, which is the Triune God transmitted into our being.<h2 class=head2>Another Paraclete</h2><p>The Spirit is also another Paraclete. Concerning this, John 14:16 says, &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&#8221; This Comforter is the Spirit of reality (v. 17). Paraclete is the anglicized form of the Greek word parakletos, which denotes one alongside who takes care of our cause, our affairs. The same Greek word is rendered &#8220;Advocate&#8221; in 1 John 2:1. Today we have both the Lord Jesus in the heavens as well as the Spirit within us as our Paraclete, taking care of our case. The Spirit as the reality of Jesus ministers to us and takes care of all of our needs.<h2 class=head2>Receiving All That Is of the Son, Thus Becoming the Son&#8217;s Transfiguration</h2><p>The Spirit receives all that is of the Son and thereby becomes the Son&#8217;s transfiguration. This is revealed in John 16:14 and 15: &#8220;He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He receives of Mine and shall disclose it to you.&#8221; These verses indicate that the Father has given all that He has to the Son and that the Spirit shall receive what is the Son&#8217;s and disclose it to the disciples. Because the Father has given everything He has to the Son, the Son is His embodiment. Now whatever the Son is has been passed on to the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. By this we see that the Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. We have the transfiguration and also the embodiment. This means that when we have the Spirit, we have the Son, and when we have the Son, we have the Father. We have all Three: the Father as the source, the Son as the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit as the transfiguration of the Son.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_160.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_162.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 161</div><br></body></html>
