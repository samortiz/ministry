   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being according to the Sense in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must select hymns according to the sense in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We cannot rely merely on our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not mechanically consider the nature of a meeting, or even the stage of the meeting, and then flip through our hymnal to find a suitable hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hymns that are selected in such a dead way will not be according to the spirit of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must select hymns according to the sense in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When selecting a hymn, we need to touch our spirit to see if there is an inward confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There must be an inward response so that when we sing the hymn, we will be inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Calling the Number of a Hymn Clearly and Slowly</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After selecting a hymn, we need to consider how to call out the hymn number.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not call a hymn too loudly, too softly, or so fast that others are unable to hear the hymn that has been called.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, we should call a hymn number slowly and clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When some brothers call a hymn, it is like a gust of wind that passes by so quickly that other people do not know which hymn number was called.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Other brothers call hymns in a manner that can be compared to a loud clap of thunder; it frightens people and causes them to lose their spiritual inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Still others call hymns with a voice that is so quiet that even those sitting next to them have difficulty hearing the number.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This also disturbs the spirit of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the spirit of the meeting is quite tender and can easily be disturbed, all the activities in the meeting must be refined.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must call a hymn clearly and slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our voice should neither be too loud nor too soft.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>People must be able to hear us clearly and not be disturbed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not think that these are trivial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These matters have much impact on a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Praying Matching the Nature of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our prayers, just as our selection of hymns, should match the nature of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a sister begins to pray for her son, crying bitterly with tears, this will greatly affect the feeling of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is because her prayer does not match the nature of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Matching the Progression of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The bread-breaking meeting has two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first section is for remembering the Lord, and the second section is for worshipping the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After the bread and the cup have been passed around, someone may pray long-windedly concerning the Lord s humbling Himself to be born in a manger and His dying on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because such prayer does not follow the progression of the meeting, even though it may match the nature of the meeting, it disturbs the entire meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason, our prayers must follow the progression of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Being according to the Sense in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is normal for our prayers to be according to the sense in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Using a Clear Voice</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our voice should not be too soft when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is difficult to hear some people when they pray, even if we strain to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason, we should not spare our throat and hurt the ears of the brothers and sisters when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the same time, we should not yell and shout like thunder when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such ear-quivering prayers make people feel uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The tone of our voice in prayer must be moderate, neither too high nor too low, and the pronunciation should be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Using Brief Sentences</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should use simple words in our prayer, and our sentences should be short, not long.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Exercising Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should pray with the exercise of our spirit so that our spirit comes out and releases the spirit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being Brief</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we pray, our sentences should be brief and our prayer should be brief.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Long prayers often kill a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>C. H. Mackintosh said that long prayers torture the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He would ask others not to punish the brothers and sisters by long prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>D. L. Moody was in a meeting where a sister was praying nonstop, exhausting the endurance of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He stood up and wisely recommended that while the sister was still praying, they should sing a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all need to avoid long prayers in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Considering the Response of Others</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When praying in a meeting, we must consider the response of others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If there is not a response of Amen, we should stop our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A lack of Amens means that others are not responding.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Why should we continue praying if they are not responding?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should always consider the response of others to our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should stop praying when the spirit of others does not follow.</S>
