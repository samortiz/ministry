   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this message we come to the contents of God's expression in its reality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In recent messages on the Gospel of John, we pointed out that John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One crucial thing we pointed out is that the entire universe was created for God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The invisible God desires to express Himself, and to express Himself He needs some vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, He created the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After creating the heavens and the earth with all the items, God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man was made in God's image so that one day God might enter into him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans 9:23 indicates we are clay vessels unto glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Surely the clay vessels are to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God made us in His own image just as a glove is made in the form of a hand with the intention that one day a hand would get into the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When God created man He created a spirit within him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have a body outwardly, and we have a spirit inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Between these two is our being, our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are a person with an outward organ, the body, and an inward organ, the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we touch the material world we use our body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we touch God and the spiritual things, we use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot contact God by using our body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That is the wrong organ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God made us in His image with a spirit for us to receive Him so that He might come into us to be our life and our content.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we will be His expression.</S>
