[3]  In this series of messages, we are still on the general subject of the Christian life.
[4]  In order for us to experience the Christian life, we surely need to know God, the Lord, Christ, as the Spirit.
[5]  Also, we have to know that for us to enjoy this Spirit, we have a spirit within us.
[6]  CHAPTER TWO THE DEFINITION OF THE SPIRIT 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:2; Judg.
[7]  The Spirit of Jehovah in God's reaching of men and in His care for men Judg.
[8]  The Bible is a book written not only by the Spirit but also with the Spirit 2 Pet 1:21; 2 Sam 23:2 .
[9]  God's move in man is altogether a story of the Spirit.
[10]  The preparing of the way for the Savior's coming required that His forerunner, John the Baptist, be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb, so that he could separate the people unto God from all things other than God, making them holy unto Him for His purpose.
[11]  The Spirit was there to anoint Christ and to move with Christ, but at that time the Spirit had not yet entered into the believers to flow out as rivers of living water John 7:37-39 .
[12]  But when the Spirit flows into the believers and flows out of them as many rivers of living water, God being one with man and man being one with God becomes a corporate matter.
[13]  CHAPTER THREE THE DEFINITION OF THE SPIRIT 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; Rev 21:6; 22:17c; Acts 16:7; Rom 8:9b; Phil 1:19b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 12:2b; 1 Cor 3:6, 9b, 12a; Eph 4:16b; Matt 28:19b; John 14:16-17; 15:26b; 16:13; 1 John 5:6b; Eph 2:18; 2 Cor 13:14 OUTLINE In the New Testament the Spirit is: The Spirit: Through and in His resurrection Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit to enter into His believers to flow out as rivers of living water 1 Cor 15:45b; Rev 21:6; 22:17c: The Spirit of Jesus concerning Jesus in His humanity, who passed through human living and death on the cross, indicating that in the Spirit there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and of His suffering of death as well Acts 16:7.
[14]  The Spirit of Christ concerning Christ in His divinity, who conquered death and became the life in resurrection with the resurrection power, indicating that in the Spirit there is the element of divinity that became the death-conquering and life-dispensing Spirit Rom 8:9b.
[15]  The Spirit of Jesus Christ, comprising all the elements of Jesus' humanity with His death and Christ's divinity with His resurrection, which become the bountiful supply of the unsearchable Christ for the support of His believers Phil 1:19b.
[16]  The Lord Spirit, the pneumatic Christ 2 Cor 3:17-18: 1 For the metabolic transformation of the believers into the Lord's image, from glory to glory.
[17]  We have seen that John 7:39 says "the Spirit was not yet."
[18]  It is difficult to explain why John 7:39 says this.
[19]  We saw that Jesus was anointed with the Spirit and that the Spirit was in the move of the man Jesus in His ministry to God in His last three and a half years on the earth.
[20]  Furthermore, the Lord Jesus told the disciples that they would be filled with the Spirit and that the Spirit would flow out of them as rivers of living water.
[21]  The Spirit of God was there from the beginning, but at the time the Lord spoke this word, the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , was not yet, because the Lord had not yet been glorified.
[22]  In the New Testament, the Spirit was firstly the Holy Spirit in two conceptions: the conception of John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, and the conception of Christ, which was God being born into humanity.
[23]  In the New Testament, the life-giving Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 .
[24]  This title of the Spirit is concerning Jesus in His humanity, who passed through human living and death on the cross.
[25]  It indicates that in the Spirit there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and suffering of death.
[26]  e. To Consummate the Processed Triune God 1 As the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
[27]  There are many hints in the Old Testament through which we can know that God is triune, but it is difficult to see in the Old Testament that the Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[28]  After His resurrection, and before His ascension, He came back to the disciples and charged them to disciple the nations, baptizing them, the new believers, into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[29]  The Spirit who is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the Lord Spirit is the Paraclete to us, the One who is always alongside of us to take care of our case, our affairs, and our needs.
[30]  CHAPTER FOUR THE DEFINITION OF THE SPIRIT 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:22-30; 2 Cor 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27; Eph 1:13, 11, 14; 4:30b; 2 Cor 1:22; Gal 3:8, 14; John 3:5-6; Heb 2:10; Gal 4:6; Rom 8:14-16; 15:16; 8:26; Titus 3:5b; 2 Cor 5:17 OUTLINE In the New Testament the Spirit is: The compound anointing Spirit Exo 30:22-30: Compounded with the unique God, as the base, as the divinity of Christ, typified by the one hin of olive oil v. 24b.
[31]  With God's Divine Trinity, typified by the three units of five hundred shekels of the spices vv.
[32]  In the previous two messages we have seen that the Lord Jesus had the divine Spirit in Him for His incarnation, human living, and ministry, but at that time He had not yet become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b to flow out of His believers as rivers of living water John 7:38-39 .
[33]  In order for the Spirit to come into the believers and flow out of them, the Lord had to take two more steps.
[34]  In His death He cleared away the obstacles of sin, the flesh, the world, and Satan so that we could receive the Spirit for the Spirit to flow out of us.
[35]  Now we want to see a further aspect of the Spirit in the New Testament.
[36]  The Spirit is the compound anointing Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:22-30.
[37]  And just so the Spirit of God as poured out at Pentecost was indeed something new....When poured out at Pentecost, He came as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the Spirit of the Incarnate, crucified, and exalted Christ, the bearer and communicator to us, not of the life of God as such, but of that life as it had been interwoven into human nature in the person of Christ Jesus.
[38]  It is in this capacity specially that He bears the name of Holy Spirit, for it is as the Indwelling One that God is Holy....Christ came...to bring human nature itself again into the fellowship of the Divine life to make us partakers of the Divine nature....In His own person, having become flesh, He had to sanctify the flesh, and make it a meet and willing receptacle for the indwelling of the Spirit of God....From His nature, as it was glorified in the resurrection and ascension, His Spirit came forth as the Spirit of His human life, glorified into the union with the Divine, to make us partakers of all that He had personally wrought out and acquired, of Himself and His glorified life.
[39]  And the Holy Spirit could come down as the Spirit of the God-man most really the Spirit of God, and yet as truly the spirit of man....Just as in Jesus the perfect union of God and man had been effected and finally completed when He sat down upon the throne, and He so entered on a new stage of existence, a glory hitherto unknown, so too, now, a new era has commenced in the life and the work of the Spirit.
[40]  In the New Testament, we see the compound anointing Spirit operating as the Holy Spirit to seal the believers of Christ Eph 1:13; 4:30b; 2 Cor 1:22a .
[41]  In the New Testament, the Spirit is also revealed as the blessing of the gospel Gal 3:8, 14 .
[42]  CHAPTER FIVE THE DEFINITION OF THE SPIRIT 4 Scripture Reading: Rev 1:4-5a; 4:5; 5:6; 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; Rom 8:2; John 20:22; Acts 1:8; 2:2, 4, 17; Rev 22:17a; 21:1 22:5 OUTLINE In the New Testament the Spirit is: The seven Spirits Rev 1:4-5a; 4:5; 5:6: The sevenfold intensified Spirit for the church's degradation in the dark age.
[43]  Ranked as the second in the Divine Trinity instead of the third, indicating the intensification of the Spirit 1:4-5a.
[44]  As the seven lamps burning before the throne of God to carry out the divine administration for the consummation of the divine economy 4:5.
[45]  As the seven eyes of the Lamb, the observing parts of our Redeemer, to observe all the churches in all the nations for the building up of His Body to consummate the building up of the New Jerusalem, accomplishing the eternal economy of God 5:6; 21:1-3.
[46]  We have seen that in the Old Testament, the Spirit is revealed simply as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Spirit of holiness.
[47]  But when we come to the New Testament, the revelation concerning the Spirit is very complicated.
[48]  At the beginning of the New Testament, we see the Holy Spirit, but He was still not yet "the Spirit."
[49]  This is unveiled in John 7:39, which says, "The Spirit was not yet."
[50]  The Spirit was not yet because Jesus in His humanity had not yet been glorified.
[51]  Because Jesus in His humanity had not yet been changed, the Holy Spirit who brought forth Jesus through His conception and birth still remained the same, without change.
[52]  The book of Revelation reveals the seven Spirits as the sevenfold intensified Spirit for the church's degradation in the dark age.
[53]  F. The Essential Spirit and the Economical Spirit of the Processed Triune God
[54]  The essential Spirit of God is the Spirit of life breathed into the believers as the divine essence of the divine life Rom 8:2; John 20:22 .
[55]  CHAPTER SIX THE DEFINITION OF OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12b; Gen 2:7; Zech 12:1b; Isa 42:5; Luke 9:23-25; Job 32:8; Prov 20:27; John 4:24; 2 Tim 4:22a; Gen 2:9b; 1:27; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 9:1; 8:16; 1:9; Luke 1:47; 1 Cor 2:11; Mark 2:8 OUTLINE We being created by God a tripartite being 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12b: With a body formed of the dust, as our outward frame Gen 2:7a.
[56]  With a spirit produced of God's breath, as our intrinsic organ, ranked with the heavens and the earth Gen 2:7b; Zech 12:1b; Isa 42:5.
[57]  With a soul, the issue of our spirit being added to our body, as our self in between our body and our spirit Gen 2:7c; Luke 9:23-25.
[58]  In the previous messages, we have seen the definition of the Spirit.
[59]  In order to help us see the truth concerning the Spirit in a full way, I would encourage us to read and even to study a small booklet we have published entitled The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus.
[60]  This booklet is a reprint of chapter five of Andrew Murray's book The Spirit of Christ.
[61]  When I began to minister in the United States in 1962, a number of people told me that they had never before heard that man has a spirit.
[62]  Many teachers and preachers do not know or believe the truth concerning the human spirit.
[63]  I. WE BEING CREATED BY GOD A TRIPARTITE BEING
[64]  In the record of God's creation in Genesis, God did not give us many details concerning the heavens because the heavens do not have that much direct relationship with us.
[65]  But concerning the earth, God gave us a number of details.
[66]  Job 32:8 says, "But there is a spirit in man,/And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding."
[67]  According to the poetic structure of this verse, the spirit and the breath of God, the Almighty, are in apposition.
[68]  Job 32:8 shows that God made our spirit with the breath of God.
[69]  We are living on this earth for the purpose of receiving God and expressing God.
[70]  OF OUR HUMAN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Zech 12:1b; Prov 20:27; Job 32:8; John 4:24; 2 Tim 4:22a; Rom 8:11; Eph 2:22; Rom 8:4b; 12:11; 1 Cor 2:11a, 15a; Acts 17:16; 19:21; 20:22; Rom 1:9; Rev 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10; Acts 18:25 OUTLINE In the eyes of God ranked with the heavens and the earth Zech 12:1b.
[71]  In Christ and the Spirit indwelling us, taking our spirit as God's habitation 2 Tim 4:22a; Rom 8:11; Eph 2:22.
[72]  God created man in a marvelous way so that man could contact God, contain God, and receive God as life to express God.
[73]  Genesis not only tells us that God created man in His image and after His likeness but it also tells us how He created man.
[74]  In the eyes of God, our human spirit is ranked with the heavens and the earth.
[75]  Our human spirit is important in our contacting God, and our contacting God is our worship to God.
[76]  In our Christian walk, we need to walk according to our spirit Rom 8:4b .
[77]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 1:6-7; Rom 8:5-6; Heb 4:12 OUTLINE To fan our spirit 2 Tim 1:6-7: God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, love, and sobermindedness.
[78]  Our spirit is surrounded by the three parts of the soul will, emotion, and mind: Our will should be strong, full of power.
[79]  It is very good that we can be on the study of our spirit.
[80]  I can testify that whenever we teach and speak about our human spirit, we have joy.
[81]  Second Timothy 1:6-7 indicates that we need to fan our spirit into flame.
[82]  For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness."
[83]  Paul wrote 2 Timothy 1:6-7 according to his experience.
[84]  He reminded Timothy to fan into flame the gift of God within him.
[85]  Instead, God has given us a spirit in the center of our being surrounded by the three parts of the soul the will, the emotion, and the mind.
[86]  THE BELIEVERS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:2; Luke 15:8-9; John 16:8-11; Luke 15:18-24 OUTLINE Sanctifying the God-chosen people before they repent and believe 1 Pet 1:2:
[87]  Beginning in this message we want to study, to investigate, the Spirit's work on and in the believers.
[88]  Now we need to consider what the Spirit did when He sanctified us.
[89]  Another portion of the Word that shows the sanctifying Spirit is John 16:8-11.
[90]  These verses say, "And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me; and concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged."
[91]  The Spirit came to us to sanctify us unto God, to separate us unto God, first by seeking us carefully and second by convicting us prevailingly.
[92]  The Spirit also convicts the world concerning judgment with Satan unto eternal perdition v. 11 . Between God and man, there are three crucial things sin, righteousness, and judgment.
[93]  THE BELIEVERS 2 Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6, 8; 1:12-13; 3:6; 1 Pet 1:3; Titus 3:5 OUTLINE Regenerating the convicted and believing believers John 3:5-6, 8: Begetting them to be the children of God John 1:12-13: In their spirit John 3:6.
[94]  In the previous message, we saw the Spirit's work in sanctifying the God-chosen people before they repent and believe.
[95]  In this message we want to see the Spirit's work in regenerating the convicted and believing believers John 3:5-6, 8 .
[96]  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."
[97]  The God-created man needed to be reborn of God, not just to have God's breath of life, but to have God's life itself.
[98]  But the highest purpose in God's giving a wife to a brother is to give him trouble so that he can be transformed.
[99]  The Lord Jesus said that if you are not born anew, you cannot enter into the kingdom of God John 3:5 .
[100]  THE BELIEVERS 3 THE SPIRIT'S DISPOSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:2; Heb 13:12; 9:13-14; 10:29; Rom 15:16b; 6:19, 22; Titus 3:5; Rom 12:2b; 2 Cor 4:16; 3:18; 1 Thes 5:23; Eph 1:4-5 OUTLINE The three aspects of the sanctification in the Scriptures: The Spirit's sanctification in seeking the God-chosen people before their repentance 1 Pet 1:2.
[101]  After making His economy, God started to carry out His economy in eternity past.
[102]  The first step in God's carrying out of His economy was His selection.
[103]  He foreknew us 1 Pet 1:2a and chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world Eph 1:4 .
[104]  From the time we were called, the sanctifying Spirit started to work for God's "sonizing," for God's sonship.
[105]  THE BELIEVERS 4 THE HOLDING LINE IN THE CARRYING OUT
[106]  OF THE DIVINE ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:14; 4:30; 1 Pet 1:2; Luke 15:8-10, 17-21; Heb 13:12; 2 Cor 5:17; John 1:12-13; Rom 12:2b; Eph 4:23; Gal 6:15; 2 Cor 4:16; 1 Cor 3:12; 2 Cor 3:18; Phil 3:21; Rom 8:23 OUTLINE The divine sanctification is the holding line in the carrying out of the divine economy: Holding all of our spiritual experiences from our repentance to our glorification.
[107]  In message eleven we pointed out that there are three aspects of the divine sanctification.
[108]  Now we want to see seven steps of the divine sanctification.
[109]  Some may argue by saying that the angels are holy and that in the Old Testament there are God's holy people with the holy city.
[110]  The temple was holy, and the gold was sanctified by the temple Matt 23:17 .
[111]  The priests were holy, the altar was holy, and the offerings were sanctified by the altar v. 19 . In this sense something that belongs to God can also be considered holy.
[112]  After being anointed they became holy because they became something for God and something belonging to God.
[113]  THE STEPS OF THE DIVINE SANCTIFICATION A. The Seeking Sanctification
[114]  Second Corinthians 4:16 says that day by day our outer man, our old man, is being consumed, and our inner man, our new man, is being renewed.
[115]  THE BELIEVERS 5 THE RENEWING OF THE SANCTIFYING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Titus 3:5; Rom 6:19, 22; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15; 2 Cor 4:16-17; Rom 12:2b; 2 Cor 4:10; Rom 8:18; Eph 4:23; Col 3:10 OUTLINE The renewing is the continuation of the Spirit's sanctification Titus 3:5: Regeneration is the initial step of the Spirit's dispositional sanctification in the believers.
[116]  According to the teaching of the New Testament, God's salvation is altogether hinged on sanctification.
[117]  We saw in the previous message that sanctification is the holding line in the carrying out of the divine economy and that this line begins from the seeking Spirit's sanctification.
[118]  The Spirit's seeking us out is the initial work of the sanctifying Spirit.
[119]  OF THE SPIRIT'S SANCTIFICATION A. Regeneration Is the Initial Step of the Spirit's Dispositional Sanctification in the Believers
[120]  THE BELIEVERS 6 THE TRANSFORMING OF THE SANCTIFYING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 12:2b; 2 Cor 4:16, 11; Phil 3:10; 2 Cor 3:18b; Phil 3:12-14; Col 3:10-11; Eph 4:16 OUTLINE The Spirit's transforming is the working out of the Spirit's renewing: Transforming is by renewing Rom 12:2b.
[121]  In this message we come to the third step of the sanctifying Spirit.
[122]  The first step is regeneration and the second step is renewing.
[123]  Now we come to the transforming of the sanctifying Spirit.
[124]  God in His economy desires to gain the Body of Christ to be the very organism of the Triune God.
[125]  This expression confirms that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ.
