<p>We also must train the saints how to move in the home meetings. This is a crucial point. Singing is not the main thing, although singing helps a lot. For this purpose I would also propose that every church should have a little training of singing. After the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, you could take fifteen minutes to refer the saints to the hymnal. You could tell the new ones and the other saints something about the hymns and, using the piano, ask them to sing some hymns in a learning way. You cannot do this once for all. You have to do this quite often. This practice will raise up something.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRAINING THE SAINTS TO LEARN HOW TO SPEAK</h2>
<p>The most important thing, however, is to train everyone, old and young, brothers and sisters, new ones or old ones, to learn how to speak. We have found out that up to the present time the best way to speak is to use the messages. But do not use any message as a whole. You have to select good portions from a number of messages and notes to compile a message of about three or four pages. I have pointed out all the crucial points of the messages contained in the fourteen Epistles of Paul, but even that would be a little too much. You still need to drop something to make the word shorter. For every home meeting we need to use speaking material, but we always have to avoid anything official, formal, or ritualistic. We should not read anything formally, officially, or ritualistically. Do not follow the old way where we all take turns reading, and then someone stands up to give a concluding word. You have to forget about this old way. Actually, you should not read the material but speak it in a regular, ordinary, normal conversation.</p>
<p>Note 17<sup>1</sup> in 1 Corinthians 3 (Recovery Version) could be part of your speaking material. In the home gathering one person could say, &ldquo;Brothers, this note shows us that the word destroys means ruins, corrupts, defiles, mars. Here the Bible tells us that if we destroy the temple, we will suffer. And to destroy the temple is to ruin it, to corrupt it, to defile it, and to mar it.&rdquo; This kind of speaking is enough for the first person. Then someone else could speak the next sentence in a living way: &ldquo;To destroy the temple of God means to build with the worthless materials of wood, grass, and stubble. We have to realize that to build the church of God with these natural things is to destroy, to ruin, the temple.&rdquo; We have to practice getting into the material in a very simple way like a speaking. You may explain something as we illustrated above, but you do not need to explain every clause or every sentence. The next person may continue to read (speak), &ldquo;This refers to some Jewish believers who attempted to build the church with the elements of Judaism, and to some Greek believers who endeavored to bring philosophical elements into the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems that this is a kind of reading. Actually, if you get used to it, your reading will sound like speaking. You will then speak your way through the material spontaneously. There should be no legality. At a certain point you may give a testimony. Do not tell a long story, a &ldquo;sea story.&rdquo; Just share a little bit. You have to believe that this kind of meeting will edify, nourish, enlighten, encourage, comfort, and even reprove people. This is an all-inclusive meeting. The saints will get this kind of help week after week throughout the year. It is not necessary to spend too long a time for this kind of speaking&mdash;just about fifty minutes at the most. You could have a meeting for two hours, so there is plenty of time to do many things in the meeting to cover so many needs. We need to endeavor in this way for the home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENDEAVORING TO HELP THE SAINTS PRACTICE<br />
THE HOME GATHERINGS</h2>
<p>I know of one particular city in the United States that is endeavoring to help the foreigners, the immigrants, speak the local language. We need to endeavor in the same way to help the saints practice the home gatherings. This new way may cause some of the elders to want to resign. This will kill the ambition. There will be hardly any comfort, leisure time, or rest. There will only be burden and labor. No one will have the ambition to be an elder with this new way because it is too hard. With this new way no elder can be idle.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord's Present Move &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
