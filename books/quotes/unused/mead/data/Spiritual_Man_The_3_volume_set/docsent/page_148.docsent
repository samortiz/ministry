   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God wants to do away with the action of our flesh, but He does not intend to destroy us as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He never eliminates our personality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He does not want us to become a lifeless mechanism; He wants us to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He does not want us to become void of thoughts, affections, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He desires that we think, feel, and decide in accordance with what He thinks, feels, and decides.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit will not replace our thoughts, feelings, and decisions; we still have to think, feel, and make decisions in accordance with God's own purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We will thoroughly discuss this later.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If our mind, emotion, and will become utterly passive, requiring an outside power to take their place, then the spirit will inevitably fall into a passive condition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a believer is unable to use his own spirit and needs a power from without to "move" his spirit, Satan will take full advantage of him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is a fundamental difference between the work of the Holy Spirit and the work of an evil spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit motivates men to work by themselves, never denying their personality, but an evil spirit requires men to be entirely still, doing the work for them, so that their spirit becomes mechanical.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, passivity of the spirit i.e., a passive state involving the whole person not only gives an evil spirit opportunity to work, but also makes the Holy Spirit unable to function properly because He lacks the cooperation of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The result is the domination of the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If believers are not spiritual, they will not have the danger of coming into contact with evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After they become spiritual, however, evil spirits will come to attack their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only spiritual believers, not fleshly ones, have the danger of passivity in the spirit and counterfeit experiences of the spirit, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because believers misinterpret the nullifying of the flesh, they put their spirit into a passive state.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This allows an evil spirit to pretend to be the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In their ignorance believers think that any moving must come from the Holy Spirit, and they receive it unwittingly, forgetting that not only the Holy Spirit but also evil spirits can affect their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, they give Satan the ground to attack them gradually in order to corrupt their morality, mental vigor, and health and make them suffer unspeakable pain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what has happened to many believers who have experienced "the baptism in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It occurs because believers do not realize that once they have this kind of experience, they enter into a closer connection with the spiritual world either God's or the devil's and give the Holy Spirit or an evil spirit the possibility of influencing them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When they are about to experience this baptism, they consider any supernatural experience to be the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are baptized in the spirit, but we must ask what kind of spirit they are baptized in, for a baptism in the Holy Spirit and in an evil spirit are both a "baptism in the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many believers want to experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit, but they do not know that the Holy Spirit needs the cooperation of their spirit, that their personality is not nullified, and that they still maintain their free will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, they plunge into a passive state, giving up their own will and allowing a power from without to burn, twist, and cast them down.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, they are baptized in an evil spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some believers do have a genuine experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, yet they are subsequently deceived because they are unable to distinguish between the power of the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since they have had such a special experience, they think that they are under the full control of the Holy Spirit and should not make any decisions, thinking rather that they should remain in a passive attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their spirit thus falls entirely into a passive state.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan begins to give them extremely happy feelings with numerous visions, dreams, and other supernatural experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They do not realize that all these are due to their passive spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, they consider them all to be from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even though they have these experiences, they will still be able to tell the difference if they can distinguish their own feelings from the spirit and the supernatural from the spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, a mistake concerning the passivity of their spirit, compounded with a mistake in their lack of discernment, deeply entraps them in the enemy's deceit.</S>
