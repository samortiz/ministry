   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE CHRIST HIS PERSON 31</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider further what Christ is in His person to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the believers' experience and enjoyment Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The last Adam was Jesus Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a man in the flesh, He was the Lamb of God who took away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, when He was crucified, He dealt with our natural life and our self.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This made it possible for us to receive the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After dying on the cross, the last Adam, our Redeemer, became in His resurrection the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Redeemer, it was the life-giving Spirit who came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may not realize that we have received the Lord Jesus not only as the Redeemer and the Savior but also as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we believed in Christ, we knew that we were sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we prayed, repented, confessed, and received Him as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we received Him as our Redeemer, He came into us not only as the Redeemer, but also as the life-giving Spirit for the purpose of dispensing life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the life-giving Spirit He is the life-dispensing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The life-giving Spirit is the reality and the life pulse of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If Christ had merely been resurrected with a body and had not become the life-giving Spirit, His resurrection would not mean nearly as much to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It would simply be an objective fact unrelated to life and would then be comparable to the resurrection of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The resurrection of Lazarus was merely an act of resurrection; it did not produce anything related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But Christ's resurrection is absolutely a matter related to life, for in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit to dispense life into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, resurrection was not merely an objective act accomplished by Christ, but is very much related to us subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Resurrection was not only an act in itself; it was also a process to bring forth the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through the process of resurrection Christ, who ended the old creation, became the life-giving Spirit, the germinating element of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Christ entered into resurrection, He became the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, this life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Triune God has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, and now in resurrection He is the life-giving Spirit with the life essence to germinate the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have become the new creation germinated by the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, the life-giving Spirit is the totality of all Christ is as the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Corinthians unveils that the Christ who is the portion of all believers and into whose fellowship we have been called 1:2, 9 is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is God's power and God's wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us 1:24, 30 ; our glory for our glorification 2:7 , hence, the Lord of glory 2:8 ; the depths of God 2:10 ; the unique foundation of God's building 3:11 ; our Passover 5:7 , the unleavened bread 5:8 , the spiritual food, and the spiritual rock flowing out the spiritual drink 10:3-4 ; the Head 11:3 and the Body 12:12 ; the firstfruit 15:20, 23 , the second Man 15:47 , and the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As such an all-inclusive One, He is now the life-giving Spirit, the totality of all He is for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
