   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CARING FOR HIS HOLY NAME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ezekiel 36:21-23 says, But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord God, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see that in recovering His people, God acts on behalf of His holy name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The inward recovery of life is carried out by God for the sake of His name.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many of us can testify that we have been recovered and revived not because of any merit in ourselves but because God did something in us for His own name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>BRINGING THEM TO THEIR OWN PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land v. 24 . In His recovery, God brings us out from the world and brings us back to our own place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He returns us to Christ as our land.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE LORD WASHING US WITH CLEAN WATER</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord not only brings us back to the enjoyment of Christ; He also washes us with clean water.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Zechariah 13:1 says that the Lord s blood is a washing fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, the clean water in Ezekiel 36:25 refers to the Lord s redeeming and cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus washes us with His cleansing blood not only when we are saved but also every time we are revived and brought back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Cleansed from Filthiness</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord washes us from two categories of dirty things from filthiness and from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Filthiness includes all kinds of sinful things, unjust things, unrighteous things, and dark things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It also includes hating others, doing wrong to others, and indulging in worldly amusements.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we were saved, we felt ashamed of these filthy things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are revived, we also have such a feeling of shame, not wanting to recall the sinful and worldly things that we were once involved with.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord s blood as the clean water washes us from all our filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps today we need to be washed from gossip, rumors, jealousy, criticism, and unkindness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We praise the Lord that no matter how filthy we were, the Lord s blood is the clean water that washes us and cleanses us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Cleansed from Idols</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before we were saved, we had not only a great deal of filthiness, but we also had many idols.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This also might have been our situation after we became backslidden and before we were revived.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Consider how many idols you had before you were saved or revived.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For some, an article of clothing is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They love this item of clothing more than they love the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once while Brother Watchman Nee was ministering in Shanghai, he suddenly pointed to a certain sister and asked, How many chapters are there in Matthew?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She answered, Twenty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then Brother Nee asked her how many buttons were on her long gown, and without hesitation she told him the correct number.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brother Nee went on to say, You know your long gown so well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You even remember how many buttons it has.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But you do not remember how many chapters there are in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This simple illustration shows us that we may love an article of clothing more than we love the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Anything that we love more than the Lord is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some Christians have never shed a single tear for the Lord Jesus, but they have shed many tears for their clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This proves that they love clothing more than the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Others may care for things such as a doctoral degree or a high position.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Still others may desire fame or may want to make a name for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All these things are idols.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need the Lord s redeeming blood to cleanse us not only from all our filthiness but also from all our idols.</S>
