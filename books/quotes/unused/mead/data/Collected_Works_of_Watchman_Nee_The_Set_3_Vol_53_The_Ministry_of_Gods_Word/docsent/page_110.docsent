   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WORDS BEING PLAIN AND HIGH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All ministers of God's word should learn from the Scripture the character of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once they learn this, they will know under what circumstances God will use them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Simply put, there are two characteristics to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, it is plain; second, it is high.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's word is plain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even a blind man will not be lost and a lame man will not be put out of joint by God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's word is very clear and plain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The parables in the Word are not riddles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God's word were a riddle, it would mean that it was not written for man to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's word is not a riddle; it is clear and plain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, every minister of God's word should learn to speak in a plain way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must have the habit of speaking plainly and simply; we should not be wordy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should take care that others understand our words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If others do not understand our words, we have to change our way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should always remember that God's word is given for men to understand, not to misunderstand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew 13 is an exception because the Jews rejected the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, God's word was hidden from them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A minister of the word has to be trained in his ability to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may understand something today, and it may take us just five minutes to comprehend it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we may have to spend five hours to contemplate on it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we speak it, we should ask a brother whether he understands what we are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he does not understand, we have to change our way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to speak in such a way that others understand immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should never speak for half an hour and then find that only five minutes of our speaking were understood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, we should speak for five minutes and make sure that others have understood those five minutes of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is better to speak less than to waste twenty-five minutes of time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to learn to speak plainly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should develop the habit of speaking clearly and not be tempted to become wordy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should always use simple words and always consider how we can make our speaking understandable.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to ask God to give us plain words that we can express.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may express our thoughts through a parable, but we still have to make our word clear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the very nature of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the nature of our speaking is different from the nature of God's word, we will surely encounter problems in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who have a problem with their speaking should forget about their "face."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They should humble themselves and seek advice from other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They should practice speaking to others for five minutes to see whether or not others understand what they are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They should be willing to accept correction so that they can speak longer the next time, perhaps ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since we are here to speak for God, we have to learn to speak, and our words have to be uttered clearly sentence by sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The meaning has to be obvious, and the choice of words has to be suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We speak to make others understand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God does not want His word to become a riddle, like some parables in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God does not want men to have to spend a great deal of time trying to understand His word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A minister of the word should often seek advice from more learned and experienced brothers and should ask for their criticism concerning any part that is not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He should learn to improve his speaking and strive to make his words simple and plain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's word is plain, but His word is also high and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God never says anything shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He never says anything that sounds titillating but conveys no spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The speaking of the minister of the word should be like a hammer; in striking God's word, one should hit hard.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If he hits softly, his word will not touch God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If our words are shallow, we cannot express God's word no matter how hard we try.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our speaking must maintain a degree of height and profundity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once we change the nature of God's speaking, we cannot touch His word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our speaking must be high.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our words must be high and profound because the Lord of hosts is coming through our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once our words become shallow, God will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some brothers speak in such a low way when they quote a verse that it is difficult to imagine that God's word can be released through them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some brothers have such a childish way of exhortation that one wonders how God's word can come out of their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must take care of the loftiness of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As soon as our words become low, God's speaking diminishes or even disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When our words remain shallow, God cannot find any opportunity to thrust Himself out of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The more our exhortation stays on a low plane, the less others will touch anything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more our exhortation remains on a high plane, the more others will touch something.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is a very strange phenomenon.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Suppose a two- or three-year-old girl has just learned to understand words.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can say to her, "Tonight I will buy you a piece of candy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you behave well, the Lord Jesus will love you."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is all right to say this to a child.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if we say on the platform, "Tonight I will give you all a piece of candy; if you listen quietly to my preaching, the Lord Jesus will love you," will this exhortation work?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is low exhortation, a childish exhortation; it is baby talk.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once our words become low, there is no more divine speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God wants His servants to always remain on a high plane.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The higher we climb, the better our audience will receive our word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must realize that it is an important duty of the minister of the word to climb high before God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The higher we climb, the more divine speaking there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we do not aim high, our teachings and exhortations will be low; we will be short of God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Once our words are low, God's word will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God does not tolerate any low thoughts, low words, low exhortations, low parables, or low expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, our words have to be high yet, at the same time, clear and plain.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the way to release God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Sometimes we have the light, the word, and the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We want to say the word in a plain way, but the pressure is great, and we cannot be plain.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is hard to speak plainly even when we practice.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we do not practice, how can we do it?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must learn to speak simply, plainly, and clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have to make this our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>At the same time, we have to aim our words as high as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should never touch low things.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Once we touch low things, God's word will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is a very important point.</S>
