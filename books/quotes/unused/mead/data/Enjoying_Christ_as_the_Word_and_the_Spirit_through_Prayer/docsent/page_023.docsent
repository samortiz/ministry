   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRAYING NOT WITH COMPOSED UTTERANCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT WITH THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we see a building on fire, we would not say to our neighbor, My dear friend, you must know that there is a fire close by.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No one would compose in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, we would cry, Fire!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is an expression, not an explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must learn to pray in the way of expressing something from our inner realization.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Within ourselves we realize something of the Lord, so we simply express it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many of the Psalms in the Old Testament are spoken in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They do not explain things; rather, they express something.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How much more should this be the case with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Too many of us have learned the wrong way to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That is the religious, natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to change our way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the dear brothers among us would take this word to practice to pray from our inner realization, our prayer will be much improved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we practice, the more we will be delivered from the way of composition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we reduce our composing, we will have more expression, and when we have more expression, we will have the riches not of composition but of the items of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may say, O Lord, You are my food, my drink, and my breath.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Oh, my fresh air!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My strength and my enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord as food, drink, and breath are His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we will continue, You are my satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Oh, the preciousness and freshness of this air!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>O Lord, how refreshing!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is beyond words to express.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This kind of prayer is rich in essence, not in composition, sentences, clauses, and words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more we pray in this way, the more we will absorb the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to practice this kind of prayer again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must learn not to compose but to express something from within our spirit to contact the Lord with simple utterances, the shorter the better.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do this, we will sense the riches of Christ, and we will have the application and practicality of the experience of Christ in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We enjoy Him all the time, so when we come to Him, we have a certain realization, a certain sense.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may have enjoyed the Lord much throughout the whole afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in the evening we may have five minutes to pray before dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no need to close our door or even to kneel down.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Wherever we are, we can simply express something to the Lord: O Lord, what a strengthening throughout my whole afternoon!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I adore You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You are my strength.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we pray in this way, the more we will be strengthened, the more we will enjoy Him, and the more we will absorb Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>NOT CARING FOR OUR NATURAL MIND BUT EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO PRAY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Psalms were written in the way of expressions to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, so many New Testament Christians cannot compare with the Old Testament psalmists.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They have the indwelling Spirit, but they do not use their spirit to pray with simple expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not that we should pray with Old Testament terms, such as, So panteth my soul after thee, O God Psa 42:1 KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, it is that the principle of the psalmists is right: O God, my soul pants for You!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all must learn to change our way of praying.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I believe that if we do this, the brothers and sisters will be more living, and the meetings will also be more living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even if we pray with a good spirit, we may still have too much composition in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is because we all graduated from the same school where we majored in the same field of old prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to drop the composition in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must learn to pray by exercising our spirit to express something, not by exercising our mind to compose something.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the proper principle of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Any muscle we use is always strengthened and enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is the same with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more we use our spirit, the more it will be enlarged and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In prayer we must learn to concentrate our spirit and forget our natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not compose anything but simply express something from within according to our realization and sense.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to have an inward sense of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can sense Him not only as our food, our drink, and our portion but as many other items.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sometimes we may say, O Lord, I am experiencing Your sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Throughout this whole day, what sovereignty I have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the expression of our experience of the Lord at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all have to learn this way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then I believe our meetings will be very enriched by our prayers of this kind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After a certain amount of practice, we will change the way of our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We will spontaneously say, Lord, Your presence is precious, so sweet!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we sense that we are in the mind, we should not explain this to the Lord, saying, In the past I have been too much in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How much I am in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Help me to realize that I have to exercise my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But Lord, I do not know how to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is a good prayer, but it is too much in the mind with composing, explaining, and reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we were in an earthquake, there would be no time to explain anything.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We would just cry, Earthquake!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the same way, we can simply cry, Lord, deliver me from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>O Lord, from the mind!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Deliver me!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What a mercy, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What a grace!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You are here in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>O Lord, help me to exercise my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Oh, the spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Lord, the spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>O Lord, help me to exercise!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is real prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is an expression, not an explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After praying in this way for five minutes, we will be in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Go to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You will see the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Your prayer will be absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>PRAYING SHORT PRAYERS WITH A STRONG SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To pray in the way of composing, we do not need any boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We may be weak in our spirit and self-conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>To pray in the way of expressing our realization, however, requires boldness, strength in the spirit, and deliverance from self-consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The stronger our spirit is, the shorter the sentences and clauses of our prayer will be.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The more living our prayer is, the shorter the wording will be and the less natural reasoning there will be in our utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We must learn to pray in this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Then when we come to the meeting, we can pray in the same way, in the way not of explaining but of expressing.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Learn to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I say again, we need more practice.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should practice this way of prayer not only in our private times but in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Of course, the need in the meeting will not always be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Sometimes we need a long prayer like Psalm 119, the longest psalm, with one hundred seventy-six verses in twenty-two stanzas of eight verses each.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>However, most of the time our prayer in the meetings should be living, strong, and short to express something of our realization of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Short prayers that are not wordy are richer in their effect.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>To speak a wordy prayer means that we are praying in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When we pray in the spirit, our words are cut short.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We need to practice these two matters: to contact the Lord by dealing with the word, and to pray in this new way to enjoy Him.</S>
