   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SALT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another positive spice is salt.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is easy to understand the meaning of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Salt, first of all, kills the germs of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And as it kills the corrupting elements, it also preserves, thus imparting lasting power.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Salt has killing power, preserving power, and lasting power.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we read the biography of Jesus in the four Gospels, we see that all His activities on the earth are forever.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ages have changed and the centuries have passed away, but the life of Jesus is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It really has lasting power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is continually a kind of preserving in the life, activities, and behavior of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His activities are not like the activities of a natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of man's activities were good in the second century, but not today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some were good just thirty years ago, but today no one would be interested.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are over.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Read the four Gospels again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every page is so fresh and new.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything the Lord Jesus did is still so refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nothing could damage His activity, for there was no element of corruption within it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the corrupting elements cannot exist with the heavenly salt in the life of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence the life of the Lord Jesus will last for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I do believe that in the New Jerusalem we will often recall the pages of the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the life of the Lord Jesus, especially in His humanity, there is the salt.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the killing power, the preserving power, and the lasting power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His love to us is so pure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times the love we have toward others has almost no salt.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was sweet yesterday, but it has become bitter today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is because there is no salt.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without salt, our love becomes fermented.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must put salt into all our relationships with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To like a certain brother is good, but this kind of relationship needs to be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not mean the liking of that brother needs to be killed, but the corrupting elements in the liking must be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is the need of the killing power in the salt.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hallelujah! the humanity of Jesus has the oil, the frankincense, and the salt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Lazarus, the most intimate friend of Jesus, became sick, his sisters, Martha and Mary, sent the news to Jesus, telling Him that the one He loved was sick.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we had been Jesus, we probably would have shed a few tears and gone to see him immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But after Jesus received the report, it seems that He was not moved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He stayed where He was for several days.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not think that He did not love Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He loved him, but within His love there was the killing power, the killing of anything corrupting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His love was a pure love; therefore, it was a lasting love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you tell me that a certain brother whom I know very well is sick, it will be a real test to me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I become sorrowful and say that I must go immediately and see this brother, it proves that there is no salt, no killing power in my love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Surely this kind of love is easily stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is emotional and natural.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If, however, I have been experiencing the humanity of Jesus with the salt, when the report comes concerning this brother, I will immediately turn to the Lord: "Lord, what is Your feeling?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not want to go by my natural feeling that must be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If You do not have any feeling about this brother's sickness, then I will forget about it."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We really need the salt to kill the natural friendships, the natural love, and the natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The salt is not only for killing, but also for preserving power and for lasting power.</S>
