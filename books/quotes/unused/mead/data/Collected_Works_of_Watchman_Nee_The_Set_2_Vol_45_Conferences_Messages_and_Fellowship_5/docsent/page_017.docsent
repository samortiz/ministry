   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Loving the Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we dwell in the light, we have no problem with God whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But 1 John 3:14 says that we know we have passed from death to life because we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a difficult thing for men with different backgrounds, social statuses, races, and philosophies to come together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But Christians can do this, because we are not only "comrades" with common interests or men given to a common cause; we are those who love the brothers and sisters and who can love one another from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people can help their comrades, but they cannot love them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But a saved person who has God's life and God's love within can love others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being saved means to receive the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is something inward.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All those who are begotten of God surely love God, and they surely love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As soon as you know that a certain person is a brother, you will love him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you travel in a train or ship, there may be unbelievers all around you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But as soon as you see someone reading a Bible, you will love him no matter what denomination or sect he belongs to.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Your heart will jump for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This love for the brothers is in the divine life which we received at the time of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This love is the expression as well as the proof of our salvation and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not Continuing in Sin</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A saved person will not continue in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do not continue in sin, it proves that you are a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is something that can be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First John 2:29 says, "Everyone who practices righteousness also has been begotten of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This refers to our deliverance from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who are begotten of God practice righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The life within demands that they practice righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the characteristic of the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Under ordinary circumstances a piece of wood will not sink in water.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, under special circumstances it will sink.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you put a ton of stones on the wood, it will sink.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the wood could speak, it would voice its objection every second.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would say that it should be afloat, but that the stones have weighed it down.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But even if the wood is submerged under water, it will not become "submerged wood."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the circumstances change and the pressure is gone, the wood will come back up again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It may sink temporarily, but wood itself does not sink.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This cannot be said of rocks, which automatically sink.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if a saved brother or sister has sinned, I can still say that he is one who does not sin, because the life within him does not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If he sins, a power or nature within him will make him feel sorry about it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is something that an unbeliever can never experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A sister once testified that prior to being a Christian, she did not blush when she lied.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She was a "professional" liar.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But she changed after becoming a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When she lied, her heart would beat fast and her face would turn red.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Inwardly she would condemn the lies as sins.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is something within her that forbids her to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>An unbeliever must exercise a conscious effort to not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But for a Christian to not lie is something innate; it is the inward power that makes him not to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Lying matches the inward nature of those in the world, but it is something that goes against the Christian nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This nature has to do with the life that begat you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is difficult for you to quit gambling and smoking merely on the ground that you are a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But these are very natural things when you have the power of God's life within you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A Christian does not grit his teeth to refrain from sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is a power within him which keeps him from sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is a sinless nature within him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you sin, this nature objects and makes you feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is Christ's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not a matter of resisting sin by your own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have received a life that does not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Being delivered from sin is the third manifestation of our salvation and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Having God's Testimony in One's Heart</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>First John 5:10 tells us that God's testimony is within us; we have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Not only does the Bible say this, even our heart testifies to this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This has nothing to do with one's outward behavior; it is an inward thing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are God's children; not only does the Holy Spirit testify of this within us, even our own spirit testifies of the same.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is a difference in feeling between Brother Chen Ke-san calling his mother-in-law "mother," and his wife calling her "mother."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Brother Chen's calling is related to his circumstance; he does so because of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His wife has "the spirit of sonship," but he does not.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today we spontaneously and sweetly call God our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have the Spirit of God's Son within us, and His testimony is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many people call God the Father in a vain way in their prayer; they have merely learned of this term from others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the prayer of a nominal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All those who are genuinely saved can cry "Abba Father" from the bottom of their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>First John 5:13 says, "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many people jump to this verse too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They skip verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Verse 11 speaks of the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When a man has the testimony of God in his heart, he will spontaneously know that he has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Some read John 3:16, which says, "Every one who believes into Him...would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As they are reading it, they think they have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But when they go to bed and consider some more, they doubt whether they have it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It seems as if the life they received is not eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must have the testimony in our heart before we can know that we have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>First, there is the Son of God, and then there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Salvation and regeneration are not something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They have nothing to do with knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Salvation is to have God's Son and God's life in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is God's testimony in us that convinces us of our birth in God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As soon as we are saved, we can know God and love the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We will not continue in sin, and we have God's testimony in our heart, proving to us that we are of God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>These are the manifestations and evidences of our regeneration and salvation.</S>
