<h2 class="head3">The Covering of the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>Exodus 26:1-14 describes the four layers of the covering of the tabernacle, beginning from the inner to the outer layer. The first layer was made of ten curtains of fine twined linen. The second layer was made of eleven curtains of goats&rsquo; hair. The third layer was a covering of rams&rsquo; skins dyed red, and the fourth layer was a covering of porpoise skins.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Curtains of Fine Linen</h2>
<p>The first layer was made of ten curtains of fine twined linen (vv. 1-6; 36:8-13). These ten curtains were divided into two groups of five. The number five signifies responsibility. Our two hands each have five fingers, and all five fingers are needed in order to work and bear responsibility. Another example is the ten virgins in Matthew 25, who are divided into two groups. Five of the virgins were foolish, and five were prudent (v. 2). The number two signifies testimony, and the number five signifies responsibility. Hence, the ten curtains divided into two groups of five curtains indicate that man bears responsibility before God on the ground of testimony.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of the curtains is that they were made of fine twined linen. Cherubim were embroidered upon the curtains, and in the curtains of fine twined linen there were blue and purple and scarlet strands. These curtains of fine twined linen signify humanity mingled with divinity. Fine linen, just as fine flour, denotes the condition of the Lord Jesus as a man before God. Fine flour signifies the fineness of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; humanity (Lev. 2:1-16), and fine linen denotes the purity of the Lord&rsquo;s humanity. The cherubim signify the glory of God manifested in the Lord&rsquo;s pure humanity.</p>
<p>Cherubim bear two significances in the Bible. Every time cherubim are spoken of in the Old Testament, they are spoken of in relation to the glory of God. Ezekiel 9:3 speaks of the glory of the God of Israel being upon a cherub. The Old Testament indicates that the glory of God was entrusted to and borne by the cherubim (1 Kings 8:7-11; Ezek. 10:3-4). Thus, cherubim are often associated with the glory of God.</p>
<p>Cherubim also refer to a part of the four living creatures. The seraphim in Isaiah 6 plus the cherubim in Ezekiel 10 compose the four living creatures in Revelation 4:6-8. Hence, one aspect of the significance of the cherubim is related to God&rsquo;s glory, and the other is related to the four living creatures. Thus, they signify God&rsquo;s glory manifested in His creatures. The cherubim embroidered on the curtains signify that the glory of God was manifested in the created humanity of the Lord.</p>
<p>Fine linen denotes the condition of humanity. Before being redeemed we were not like fine linen; we were rough and coarse in our humanity. After being redeemed we now express a degree of fineness, as typified by the fine linen. Both fine linen and acacia wood refer to humanity. Fine linen mainly denotes the fineness and beauty of humanity, whereas acacia wood mainly denotes the solidness and strength of humanity. In order to appreciate the strength of redeemed humanity, we need to consider the acacia wood. In order to appreciate the beauty of redeemed humanity, we need to consider the fine linen. The acacia wood was overlaid with gold, and the fine twined linen was embroidered with cherubim. Gold signifies God&rsquo;s precious worth, and cherubim signify God&rsquo;s glory. Just as gold covered the acacia wood, cherubim were embroidered upon the fine linen. The acacia wood upheld the gold, and the fine linen upheld the cherubim. This signifies that God&rsquo;s honor and glory are upheld by redeemed humanity that is strong, heavenly, dignified, and beautiful.</p>
<p>The boards of the tabernacle were for standing; thus, they needed to be strong. The covering of the tabernacle was for the expression of glory, and as such, it needed to be fine and beautiful. This can be compared to the ceiling of a house, which is mainly for appearance rather than support. Hence, in the first layer is seen the strength and beauty of humanity and the glory of divinity. The strength and beauty of humanity are typified by the fine linen, and the glory of divinity is typified by the cherubim. The fine linen denotes the condition of our humanity, the blue strands signify our heavenly condition, the purple strands signify our kingly position, and the scarlet strands signify our redemption. Moreover, the cherubim, representing God&rsquo;s glory, were upheld by the fine linen, because the cherubim were embroidered upon it.</p>
<p>Gold and cherubim denote divinity, and acacia wood and fine linen denote humanity. This typifies the church as the matching and mingling of God and man. When a priest entered into the tabernacle, he saw acacia wood overlaid with gold and fine linen embroidered with cherubim. When people come to the church, they should see divinity upheld by humanity, that is, gold and cherubim upheld by acacia wood and fine linen. To be proper, the church must match God with a strong and beautiful humanity.</p>
<p>The condition of the church before God should be that of a curtain of fine linen with blue, purple, and scarlet strands embroidered with cherubim. Fine linen signifies the Lord being both pure and righteous. The Lord is both pure and righteous. Blue signifies a heavenly condition, purple denotes a kingly position, scarlet signifies redemption, and cherubim indicate God&rsquo;s glory being manifested in His creatures. The most appealing aspect of this layer of the covering of the tabernacle was the cherubim. The strands of blue, purple, and scarlet were not as attractive. The most charming item was the embroidered cherubim. This means that the most striking aspect of the church should be God&rsquo;s glory manifested in His creatures who have been redeemed and who are pure, righteous, heavenly, and in a royal position. These people manifest God&rsquo;s glory, as signified by the cherubim. This should be the condition of the church before God.</p>
