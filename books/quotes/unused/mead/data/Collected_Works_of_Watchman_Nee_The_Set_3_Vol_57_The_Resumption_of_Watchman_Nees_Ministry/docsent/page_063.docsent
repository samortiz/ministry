   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RELATIONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BETWEEN THE BODY AND THE MEMBERS The Starting Point Being the Body</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Tang: What is the relationship between the members and the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Where does the individual end and the Body begin?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Nee: It is difficult to answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where does the individual end and the Body begin?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let me change your starting point a little.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to ask the Lord to give us the mercy to have a make-up lesson today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to see that God's children did not receive an individual life, but a corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God sees us as one Body, but we pay attention to individual members.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Consider a stalk of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may say that there are just grains of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, there is only one stalk of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Bread is made out of many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have a corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What you should ask is when does the Body end and the individual begin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When does the individual life emerge out of the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You should not ask when does the individual end and the Body begin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One does not put all the members together and form the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, it is in the Body that the many members are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Bible there is no such thing as individuals receiving life; it always speaks of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We pay attention to the members, but God pays attention to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not think that by saying this, I am bringing you back to Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Catholic Church there is only the catholicity; there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is because it does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Body life that we are speaking of does not start from the Catholic Church, but from the corporateness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since our salvation was not strong in that it did not originate in the Body, we have to go back to the starting point to make it up for our lesson today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Corinthians 12:12 says that the Body is one and has many members.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It speaks first of the Body and then of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We proceed from the members to the Body, but this verse speaks of the Body first and then the members.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First there is the life of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we go home and live our individual lives.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These two things point out two different stances.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A different stance produces a different result.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I stand here, I can see a few stars.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when I step to the other side, I can no longer see them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The place where one stands is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The stance we need to take today is that of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What we have received is the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is only after I go home that I acquire personal inward knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother Tang's question points out our problem in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot say when the individual stops and the Body begins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the next generation studies history, they will say that Brother Tang is surely a man of 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today with the individual there is no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only with the Body is there the way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Having Fellowship in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to know that the life we have is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today man thinks that the life he has received is individual, the experience he has is individual, and the conscience within him is individual.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But in the future, we will realize what the conscience of the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In twenty years this matter will be as common as getting a haircut.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a person comes up to any major decision, he has to learn to follow the Body and fellowship with the brothers ahead of him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not think that it is a difficult thing to ask others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You have to realize that it is more difficult to be asked of others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No one likes to mind others' business.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No one can have so much interest as to take everything concerning others upon himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is troublesome, and it is too much responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, if we want to take the way of the Body, we have to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What you eat and wear by yourself are things in the realm of Adam; they are personal matters.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if you go beyond the normal limit, I will say, "This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You have taken all your monthly income to spend on eating.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You have indulged yourself in eating.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For this reason, I have to say something.''</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have to deal with the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is a matter of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The way a sister dresses may have gone beyond a certain limit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At such times someone can say, "We are not interfering with the way you dress, but this is something that is damaging the Lord's testimony.''</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is not being a busybody.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Accepting and Exercise of Authority</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some people like to assume headship apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These are busybodies.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You cannot entrust authority to them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Authority is received from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only after a person has received such authority can he execute it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only those who are willing to accept authority can execute authority.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The chief of police has received a commission.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>That is why he can execute his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No one is born a chief of police; he has to receive the responsibility before he can execute his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must see the Head first, and we must first realize that He is behind us before we can have the assurance to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I have no interest in touching others' affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All those who are interested in touching others' affairs, who like to be the head, and who like to express opinions, have to be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we do not do this, all those who like to make a display of themselves will become the authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the Body it is wrong both to be free and to be autocratic.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Those who are spiritual and weighty before the Lord should rise up to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is not because we love to speak that we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we speak, we have to speak in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Those who do not like to be involved with others and who do not like to speak because of their natural disposition should be strong to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Those who like to touch others' affairs because of their natural disposition should be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What we want is the coordination of the Body, not the coordination of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The feet are not comely.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The head is comely.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is why more people wear shoes than hats.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The stronger a member is in the Body, the more it can supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The weaker a member is, the more it should receive supply from others 1 Cor 12:22-24 .</S>
