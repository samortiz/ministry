   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING BY FAITH AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE COURSE OF ENTERING INTO A TRUTH Issue No. 33 Scripture Reading: Heb 10:38</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Two weeks ago I read many verses concerning living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today I will quote only one verse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today I will continue with the matter of living by faith, which we began about two weeks ago.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have covered what it is to live by faith and will not repeat it today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we have to add a few words to the last message before we can go on with today's subject.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What I will speak on is not in any particular order, but will be miscellaneous points, a little here and a little there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Two weeks ago I mentioned the "wave-like" living of a believer, in which he fluctuates between joy and dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For these people, their life goes up and down all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the meeting, some brothers asked me concerning the matter of intensity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They did not understand why the intensity of joy would become less and less, and the intensity of dryness would become more and more, but that in the end there would be no more difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning this point, I must add a few words today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We use the word intensity with a special meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, there is the real intensity; on the other hand, there is the intensity in the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The intensity of joy that I mentioned last time refers to the intensity of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That intensity becomes less and less.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is real is just the opposite; the intensity of what is real increases.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning dryness, the process is the same: in reality it increases, while the feeling decreases.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The joy that I mentioned the other day refers to the feeling of joy, which in intensity becomes less and less.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The dryness which I mentioned refers to the reality of dryness, which increases in intensity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As far as duration is concerned, the period of joy becomes shorter, while the period of dryness becomes longer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In feeling, the intensity of joy becomes less and less, and in reality, the intensity of dryness becomes more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the end, one feels neither joyful nor dry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why are our feelings unreliable?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are unreliable because the God we trust has not changed, the work of the Lord has not changed, and the work of the Holy Spirit has not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No matter what your feelings are, they will not affect these things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was all I said last time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was only one of the reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I will give another reason today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The things on God's side have not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The question is whether or not the things within us have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, we may have lost all taste for reading the Bible, we may not pray well, and we may feel that we do not have power in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not as excited as before, and we think that we have fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But my question is what is our motive?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If our motive has changed, I have nothing to say because we have indeed fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if our motive has not changed, we have not fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If our heart is still right, all we have to do is live by faith; we do not have to worry about our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once Mr. Hudson Taylor came to Mr. Frost, who was his co-worker of many years, and said, "I am very distressed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am not the same as when I first came to China.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I first came to China, my soul burned when I saw men who were not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I prayed earnestly day and night for God to send men from England and America.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For so many years, I loved men's souls, and prayed earnestly, and worked diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But there is one thing which is gone: I have lost the initial feeling of excitement; I have fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What should I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When Mr. Frost heard this, he thought, "This is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Mr. Taylor is the leader of the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If he has fallen, it is indeed terrible."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So he went and prayed for about two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He prayed that God would show him the way to help Mr. Taylor.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day God showed him the clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He went to Mr. Taylor and asked him, "Did you consecrate yourself to God when you left England to come to China?" Mr. Taylor said, "Yes, of course I consecrated myself to God." Mr. Frost then asked, "Have you ever taken anything that you consecrated back, during the past years?" He answered, "No." "Has your love for souls diminished?" He answered again, "No." "Has your love for the Lord changed?" The answer was again "No." "Have you become worldly?" "No." "Have you decreased your work in saving souls?" "No." Mr. Frost then said, "If you have all these things, why should you care about your feelings? What can the feelings do?" This apparent failure of Mr. Taylor taught Mr. Frost a lesson that we should not care about our feelings as long as the intention of the heart is right.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It does not matter if we feel we do not like reading the Bible or that we do not find any interest in it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The thing that matters is our motive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do we have the intention to read the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It does not matter if we feel dull after praying three or five sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The thing that matters is whether or not you want to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we did not want to pray, why are we kneeling down?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is one thing for us to feel that it is a good thing to pray; it is another thing for us to want to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Perhaps in testifying to others, we feel terrible after saying a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whether or not we love to testify is one thing; whether or not we have the intention to testify is another.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Has our heart for testifying to others changed?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Have we loved the world?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Has our love for God changed?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If our motive has not changed, it does not matter that we feel this way or that way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Please remember clearly that the fluctuating life is something that occurs only in our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Within us, there is only one line; it is neither high nor low.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Real failure occurs only when our inward being has changed or when our motive has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If our motive has changed, then indeed we are fallen and degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After this, if we rise again, it will be a real rising.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we do not rise up, then we have not risen yet; this is not like what is ordinarily referred to as highs and lows, or fluctuations in life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now I will speak on living by faith, and what it is like in our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many Christians still consider it a big problem in their spiritual experience when they find it difficult to deal with the so-called high and low times.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For example, when they first hear a new truth, they become very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But after two or three days or two or three months, the truth seems to be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It seems as if what they received the first time is now all gone and lost, and they consider this a great pity.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For this reason, many good brothers have asked what is the proper course of our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In other words, they want to know how they can spiritually advance and progress.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is what I am going to speak about.</S>
