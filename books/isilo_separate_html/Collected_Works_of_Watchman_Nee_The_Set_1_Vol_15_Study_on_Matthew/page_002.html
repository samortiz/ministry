This volume consists of notes taken during those studies that were later edited and polished. It covers the interpretation from chapter one through chapter twenty-five, chapter by chapter and verse by verse in sequence, and includes the exposition of all important sections. The contents are exceedingly rich and multifaceted, with a rich supply of life and the light of the truth.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
