   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING IN LIFE BY EATING JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have been a genuine, seeking Christian since 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I loved the Lord and the Bible so much, but for many years I never heard a message telling me that I have to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I heard message after message telling me that I had to do certain things or behave in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But no one told me that I need to grow, not to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No school can help you to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every school is doing its best to help you to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The main thing that good mothers do is to feed their children.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our homes the dining table is much more important than the desk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every Lord's Day we do not have a desk in front of us but a dining table, that is, the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have traveled to many places and have been a guest in many homes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first thing the host would care for is my eating.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In many homes I did not have a desk, but in every home I had a dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because eating is more important than studying, writing, and reading.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If God had asked us to write the Bible, we would have written it in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 11 tells us that in the night in which the Lord was betrayed, He took bread and said, "This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me" v. 24 . Then He took the cup and said, "This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me" v. 25 . Why does the Lord tell us to remember Him in this way? One day the Lord opened my eyes to see what the real remembrance of Him is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The real remembrance of the Lord is not the outward form of giving a prayer, singing a hymn, praising Him, or kneeling down.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The real remembrance of Him is to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more that you eat Him, the more you remember Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is because the remembrance of the Lord is a declaration of the way we live.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We live by eating and drinking Christ day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible is filled with the thought of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Immediately after God created man, He took care of man's eating.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not charge Adam to love Eve, and He did not charge Eve to submit to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did not charge them or give them instructions about how to be good parents.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After God created man, God only told him to be careful to eat the right tree.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you eat the right tree, you will have life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you eat the wrong tree, you will die.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later, in Exodus we see that the children of Israel kept the Passover 12:15-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were charged to strike the blood and eat the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then they entered into the wilderness where they ate manna for forty years 16:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those wanderers in the wilderness were an eating people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They had no jobs, no businesses, no stores, and no schools.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Day after day they simply ate the heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When they entered into the good land, they ate of its rich produce Josh 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the New Testament time, the Lord Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>People considered Him as a prophet, a great teacher, and some even wanted to make Him a king.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they tried to make Him a king, He withdrew from them John 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The next day He told the people that He was the bread of life v. 35 . He did not want to be their king, but He wanted to be eaten by them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In John 6:57 He said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was as if the Lord were saying, "Don't make Me your king.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Take Me as your food."</S>
