   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>JAMES MENTIONING THE SPIRIT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ONLY ONCE AS THE INDWELLING SPIRIT IN US</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>James mentions the Spirit of God only once as the indwelling Spirit in us 4:5 ; in the whole book there is no indication of the Spirit of God as five marvelous items: the life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the Lord Spirit, and the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such a Spirit was not yet before the resurrection of Christ John 7:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>James does not say anything about these rich items of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a Spirit was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, after Jesus' resurrection such a Spirit came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. The Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>James does not speak of the life-giving Spirit as the consummated Spirit of God, even as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam Christ in the flesh became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit Himself is the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Father is embodied by the Son and the Son is realized as the Spirit, so this Spirit is the consummation and the totality of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I came to the United States with the burden to teach that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hymns, #539 is on this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I wrote it in 1963.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first two stanzas of this hymn say:</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>O Lord, Thou art in me as life</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And everything to me!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Subjective and available,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus I experience Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>O Lord, Thou art the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How dear and near to me!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How I enjoy Thy marvelous</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Availability!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To all my needs both great and small</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So ready and sufficient too</S>
