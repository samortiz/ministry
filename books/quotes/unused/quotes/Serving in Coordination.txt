Whenever a brother or a sister serves in the flesh, there is a sense of something old, even six thousand years old, as old as Adam
We take care of sound teachings simply because those teachings have much to do with the matter of Christ as life
If doctrines and teachings are not related to Christ as life, we would not take care of them and would not talk about them
What we mean by the word coordination is simply to be built up together, to serve in the way of being built up together
The more you serve, the more you exercise your gift, the more you will be united, the more you will be coordinated with others
Since such a brother is so capable in himself, there are no lessons for him to learn, and there is no need for him to coordinate with others
If you would learn the lesson to be coordinated with others, you need to learn how to look down on yourself, how to be limited by others
There was a sister in China who was quite capable, educated, and experienced in doing things, and she loved the Lord very much
The more she served, the more all the others were dismissed, dismissed because of her ability and her capability
The first week that you come to serve the Lord you may take care of seventy percent of the things and the others take care of thirty percent
After one week, there are eight percent, then twelve, twenty, and eventually, maybe after one year, one hundred percent
The percentage of the work in your hands is always being reduced, yet the number of the people serving with you is always increasing
The more people you have traveling with you, the more problems you have-the luggage, the things others forget, all the special needs
One of the biggest problems is to go with several co-workers to visit a church and to be received for hospitality by the church
If you have some helpers that are a burden to you in the service, then you will be limited, broken, and adjusted
After six months if all of the service is in your hand and nearly all of the people are goneyou are almost the only one leftthat is serious
Rather, you need to consider the percentage of the service that is in your hand, and the number of the serving ones
We may talk about being broken, but the way to be broken is to serve the Lord with your brothers and sisters in the way of coordination
We can come together week after week, month after month, and year after year, but we can never have a church life
We can never be blended as one in the spirit because our natural life, our soulish life, our human nature, has never been broken
There is only one way for you to experience the real brokenness of the natural life, and that is to be coordinated with others
You cannot merely close yourself in your room to read the Scriptures and pray and praise the Lord that you are broken
Suppose, under the Lord's sovereignty, that this sister is placed in some kind of coordination and put among seven sisters
After passing through such a testing, how could this sister close herself in her room in her old way and praise the Lord that she is broken?
The sovereignty of the Lord brought her into such a situation to show her that she has to be broken in this very matter
All of these eight will then be built up together, and they will bring more and more people to be coordinated with them
We need to learn to serve in a way that we could be coordinated with others and others could be coordinated with us
The more lessons you have, the more you have to learn, and the more you learn, the more the lessons will continue to come
If you are such a brother the Lord will send you more sisters and probably under His sovereignty He will send you the most troublesome ones
We must practice to know the way of the church service, which is a service of coordination, never a service of an individual person
If the brothers would give you just a little hint that they would not have you minister, you just be willing to take it
