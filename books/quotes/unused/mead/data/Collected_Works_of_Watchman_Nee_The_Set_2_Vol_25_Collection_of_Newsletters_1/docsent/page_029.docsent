   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANSWER TO BROTHER HSIEH TIEN EN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This letter is very long, so we will print it in sections in different issues of this publication.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Greetings to the brother in the Lord, Mr. Tien En:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Mr. Nee has already returned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has read your two letters carefully, but because the work is busy, he asked me to answer them for him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In your first letter you asked the following:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Question 1: Regarding denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Answer: The Lord Jesus wanted to lead the Jews and the Gentiles who believed in Him together to become "one flock" John.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>10:3, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have been "called in one Body" Col 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit" 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord's prayer also expressed the desire that all believers "be one" John 17:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The apostle commanded us to be "diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit" Eph 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, denominations divisions like "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" are rebuked by God 1 Cor 1:12-13 and are the fruit of the flesh 1 Cor 3:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are a matter of lusts Gal 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the Bible verses quoted above, denominationalism is contrary to the Bible and is condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But we should clearly know what a denomination is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should thoroughly recognize what denominations are and the elements of a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A denomination must have:</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1 its particular name,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2 its particular truth,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3 its particular fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Its Particular Name</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Bible, we do not see churches with a particular name.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible uses three kinds of ways to describe whom the churches belong to: 1 "the church of God" Acts 20:28; 1 Cor 10:32 , "the churches of God" 1 Cor 11:16 , 2 "the churches of Christ" Rom 16:16 , and 3 "all the churches of the saints" 1 Cor 14:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are not the names of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are three ways of describing whom the church belongs to.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church of God means that the church belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church of God includes all of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The churches of Christ means the church was purchased by Christ for Himself through the shedding of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church of Christ includes all those sprinkled by Christ's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The churches of the saints means that the church is the union of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It includes all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible also describes the church as being located in one place, like "the church of God which is in Corinth" 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that "the church of God" is "in Corinth."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This does not mean that "Corinth" is the name of that church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the Bible does not have churches named for a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With the exception of these four ways to describe whom the church belongs to and what place it is in, the Bible does not mention anywhere that the church has a special name.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today people disobey the Bible, give in to their flesh, and follow man's will to have many names.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some are named for their system, like the Presbyterian Church; some are named for a doctrine, like the Holiness Church or the Methodist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some are named for people, like the Lutheran Church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some are named for a country, like the Church of England or the Church of Christ in China.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some are named for a ritual, like the Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These names are man-made, and they are all divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They separate a small portion of God's children under a certain name and set them apart from the rest of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, they are all denominations!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is true that the Bible commands us to be baptized by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But using the ritual of baptism as a name to set ourselves apart from all the children of God is not in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the contrary, this makes us a denomination which is condemned in the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Holy Spirit, through the apostle, not only rebuked those who said, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas," but He also rebuked those who said, "I am of Christ" 1 Cor 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Using "Christ" to set oneself apart from other children of God is equally condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If this is true, how much more should denominating oneself with baptism be condemned!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, if a name can denominate us, that is, set us apart from all the other children of God, it is a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a name does not include all of God's children, it is a denomination.</S>
