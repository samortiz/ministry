   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 24-25:"Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This does not mean that anyone dares to speak in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here, the Lord was trying to reveal man's hidden intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Hard" means strict.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, he was afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He failed because he did not know the Lord and His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He thought that the Lord was too strict, and he himself was still under Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we should not be afraid in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord is responsible for success or failure, but we are responsible for being faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 26:"And his master answered and said to him, Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If our Lord reaps where He has not sown and gathers where he has not winnowed, then what about that which has already been sowed and winnowed?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord surely would require of us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have no ground for argument before His judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was wholly due to the slave's laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moody said that no lazy person can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is certain that no lazy person can receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A believer will probably receive judgment not only for wrongdoing, but also for not doing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not think that because your gift is so small, you would rather not use it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not wait until you have time to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The same principle applies when we persuade a person to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We ask him to believe at once and not to wait until he has more time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 27:"Therefore you should have deposited my money with the money changers; and when I came, I would have recovered what is mine with interest."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The phrase "deposited my money with the money changers" indicates that the gift can be distributed to others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To trade means nothing other than contacting more people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To deposit "with the money changers" means to have communication with a few or even only one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He should not have buried his gift and refrained from passing it along to at least one other person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although he received a lesser gift than the others, he should have at least tried to use it a little bit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why did he not save even one person, help even one person, or comfort even one person?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not responsible for the success of our work, but it is a pity if we have not helped even one person to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the least we should save one person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 28:"Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third slave received two punishments: the talent being taken away and him being cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The faithful slaves received two rewards: joy and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Give it to him who has the ten talents."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This proves that our Lord is not a hard man, for He did not reserve the one talent for Himself, but gave it to the one who had ten talents.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 29:"For to every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Has" and "does not have" both refer to having and not having today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The one who has today will experience increase and even abundance in the future, for he may be promoted to take care of even more things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is more opportunity to exercise gifts in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But for the one who does not pay serious attention to using his gift, the gift that he has will be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 30:"And cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be "cast...into the outer darkness" is the second punishment given to the third slave.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The outer darkness is not absolute but relative.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we want to know what "the outer darkness" indicates, we need to understand at what time the Lord will say this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord will say this when He descends and the saints are caught up to the air to be judged before the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, "the outer darkness" refers to the outer part of the air.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The New Testament never mentions that hell is the outer darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hell has no darkness, but rather fire.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, there will be darkness around the Lord when He comes down, yet glory inside, as depicted by Psalm 18:9-11, which refers to His coming down parousia .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Weeping" refers to the slave's regretting that he missed the opportunity to use his one talent wisely.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"Gnashing" refers to grieving over the loss suffered, especially through his neglect in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He will not pass through the punishment of fire, but he will not receive authority and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are three things here that are interrelated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are the blood, the cross, and the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even though there are no apparent verses dealing with this relationship, it is a fact borne out in our life and experience that cannot be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Among the three, the cross of Christ is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The judgment seat of Christ is in the future, while the blood and the cross are in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, the blood is on the side opposite the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who miss the blood and the cross those who have not been dealt with by the blood and the cross will not miss the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If one misses the cross, he must at least pass through the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The believer must pass through both the blood and the cross in order to have peace before the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The blood is objective, for cleansing, redemption, and remission of sins, whereas the cross is subjective, to crucify sin, the old man, the world, and the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our failure affects two parties: God and ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Man can be washed clean and recover his fellowship with God by the blood alone if he has committed sins and broken his fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The blood deals with sins, and the cross deals with the power of sin, which can never be washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The blood can forgive the sins but cannot keep one from committing the sins again.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The soul, the world, and the flesh all need the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The blood brings in forgiveness, but the cross brings in deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We can come forward boldly to the judgment seat only if we have passed under the blood and if we have been placed upon the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Before His judgment seat, the Lord will judge our gossip, our intentions, our work, and the works we have left undone.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, the failures that have become facts have to be put under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although the light is severe at the judgment seat, it cannot reveal the sins that are under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How can we deal with a gossiping tongue?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This requires the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must receive the cross by faith and must acknowledge that the old man has been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The judgment seat cannot search the cross for things to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After being washed by the blood, we must still come back to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Otherwise, there is the possibility of repeating the offense, and we still could be rebuked before the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
