   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE GOD'S ETERNAL INTENTION AND SATAN'S COUNTERPLOT Scripture Reading: John 1:12-13; 14:16-17, 20, 23; 15:5b; Rom 8:9-11; 1 Cor 6:17; Eph 3:17a, 19b; 4:6; 1 John 4:13; 3:10a; Eph 2:2; John 8:44; Matt 16:23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death" Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this one verse two laws are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we go back to Romans 7, we shall find two other laws, the law of good in the mind v. 23 and the law of God v. 25 . Both the law of the Spirit of life and the law of sin and of death are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TWO MEANINGS OF LAW</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To begin with, we know that the word law means not only commandments but also set-up principles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Gravity is a law, for example.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So is the digestion of food.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These are both laws of nature; they are not commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul uses the word law in both senses.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When he speaks of the law of God in Romans 7:25, he is referring to Mosaic law, the Ten Commandments and all the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Exodus 20 gives us the Ten Commandments; the next three chapters list the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ordinances are like small commandments; they with the Ten Commandments, which are the principles of God's law, comprise what is called the law, not the law of nature, but the law of commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The two laws in Romans 8:2 are not commandments but principles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These laws operate by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are human beings, born of parents of flesh and blood, certain laws operate within us, not by activities but by set-up principles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul referred to one of these laws in Romans 7:21: "I find then the law that, at my willing to do the good, the evil is present with me."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This law in our members is not a commandment but a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a law not of good but of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While we are still very young, even before we start school, we spontaneously lie.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No one commanded us to lie, but when the occasion arose, that is what we did.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one taught us to steal, but we helped ourselves to some candy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then, when our mother asked if we had taken any, we quickly answered no. Was there a commandment, telling us to say no to our mother? We had no commandment; we were acting according to the law of evil within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we throw something into the air, we do not need to command it to come down; by itself it responds to the law of gravity and comes down.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the way the law operates.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As those born of flesh and blood, we have the law of sin and of death operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The blood is circulating in our body; even before my sentence is finished, the blood has already circulated a few times.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Who commanded the blood to circulate?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The blood circulates according to a law of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So it is with the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But there is another law, a superior law!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have had a second birth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By the first birth we have the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With the second birth we have the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What a wonderful name this law has!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not the law of good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not the law of ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not the law of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This law is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is meant by Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is meant by life?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Both are mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Spirit no doubt refers to the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Life must refer to the divine life.</S>
