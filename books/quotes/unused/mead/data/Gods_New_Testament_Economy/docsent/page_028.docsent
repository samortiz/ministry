   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE AND CONSUMMATED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE BREATH AND THE WIND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit that dwells within the believers and the Spirit that descends upon the believers are not two Spirits, but one Spirit in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From His incarnation through His resurrection, He became this Spirit of breath, which is for life intrinsically and essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then after His ascension, He became the Spirit of wind, which is for power.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The breath is very close to the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the breath is strengthened, it may become the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the wind is softened or slowed down a little bit, the wind becomes the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also, the Greek word pneuma and the Hebrew word ruach can be translated into Spirit, wind, or breath.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 3 the Greek pneuma is translated first into Spirit John 3:6 , and then into wind v. 8 . In Ezekiel 37, the word ruach, which is an equivalent to the Greek pneuma, is translated in the English version into three words: Spirit v. 14 , wind v. 9 , and breath vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not consider the breath as something separate from the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After being strengthened, the breath becomes the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After being softened, the wind becomes the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The wind and the breath are two aspects of one matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Also, the wind brings us the fresh air to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fresh air for our breathing depends upon the proper, strong wind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The wind is for power, and the breath is for life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praise the Lord for the breathing of the Spirit, and praise the Lord for the blowing of the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit is the breath and also the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The breath comes into us, and the wind comes upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Pentecostal movement, the breath has been neglected, and the wind has been misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE INDWELLING SPIRIT AND THE MANTLE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the past century, the Brethren teachers in England saw these two aspects to some extent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They called the Spirit on the day of resurrection the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then they called the Spirit on the day of Pentecost the mantle Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The mantle Spirit is the Spirit as the outer clothing, the uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The British Brethren teachers saw from Luke 24:49 that the disciples were to wait in Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word clothed reminded them of the mantle of Elijah, which was a symbol of the power of the Spirit 2 Kings 2:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The aspect of the mantle Spirit, which is outward, is different from the indwelling Spirit, which is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their teaching has greatly helped us, but by the Lord s mercy, standing on their shoulders, we have gone a little bit higher to see that this indwelling Spirit as the breath of life is the resurrected Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Brethren teachers did not see this in full.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The life-giving Spirit, who is still God s Spirit, the Holy Spirit, is the pneumatic Christ, the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This Christ, who is the embodiment of God mingled with man, comprising all His processes, is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord has also shown us that the mantle Spirit is the very exalted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The indwelling Spirit is the resurrected Christ, and the outpoured Spirit is the exalted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This Christ in exaltation is the mantle Spirit, which is the Spirit of power and the Spirit of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Both the resurrected Christ and the exalted Christ are the all-inclusive Spirit with these two aspects: the indwelling aspect and the mantle aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>CLOTHED WITH POWER FROM ON HIGH</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even though these hundred and twenty had received the Lord as life essentially, they still had not been equipped and qualified to carry out God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They still needed to be clothed with power from on high Luke 24:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After we wake up in the morning, our eating of breakfast fills us with life essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though we have been filled with life essentially, we still are not qualified to come to the meeting to speak something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to wash, comb our hair, and put on the proper clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we are not only constituted intrinsically, essentially, but we are also equipped economically.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a policeman did not have a uniform, no one would respect him or recognize him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a person is driving his car and he sees a man with a police uniform, he becomes very careful in his driving.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The uniform means a lot to the policeman because it represents the government for which he is working.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is his authority which qualifies him to carry out the administration of his state or government.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After the Lord had breathed Himself as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit into the disciples on the evening of the day of His resurrection, the disciples were filled inwardly with the Spirit, but they still had not received their uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They did not have the proper clothing to carry out God s administration, God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Luke 24:49 the Lord told the disciples, And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After their forty-day training, the hundred and twenty still needed the uniform, so the Lord charged them to wait in Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This power from on high was the outpoured Spirit who is the ascended, pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This power from on high was the heavenly uniform to be put on God s chosen and prepared people for their qualification to carry out God s administration.</S>
