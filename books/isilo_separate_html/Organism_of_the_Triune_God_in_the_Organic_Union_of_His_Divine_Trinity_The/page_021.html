BECOMING ONE COUPLE<br />
WITH THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>As the transformed, tripartite man, we are becoming one couple with the processed Triune God. Revelation 22:17 refers to &ldquo;the Spirit and the bride.&rdquo; This is a couple of God and man. This God is not the &ldquo;raw God&rdquo; but the processed Triune God, and this man is not the natural man but the transformed, tripartite man. Our spirit was transformed by being regenerated, our soul is now being transformed by being renewed, and our body will be transformed by being transfigured at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. At that time all three parts of our being will have been transformed. Thus, we will become a transformed, tripartite man to be God&rsquo;s bride, God&rsquo;s counterpart. God is triune and we are tripartite. The processed Triune God and the transformed, tripartite man are a universal couple that match each other in every way.</p>
<p>The Triune God has been fully processed, and by the time of His coming back, a group of overcoming saints will have been fully transformed. Revelation 19 tells of the marriage feast that these saints enjoy with the processed Triune God (vv. 8-9). Eventually, the Spirit and the bride speak together as a couple. The conclusion of the entire revelation concerning God in the Bible is that He is now the Spirit, the consummated Triune God. From God&rsquo;s creation through His ascension was the period of the process of the Triune God. The consummation of this long process is the consummated Spirit, who is the Spirit. When the Bible says &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; in Revelation 22:17, it is referring to the consummated Triune God who is the Bridegroom. &ldquo;The bride&rdquo; refers to the transformed, tripartite man, who is composed of the perfected, overcoming saints, including both the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers. The bride of the consummated God is the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom. Revelation 21:9 and 10 tell us that the New Jerusalem is the bride, the wife of the Lamb. The bride is mainly for the wedding day, while the wife is for the entire life. The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium and the wife, composed of all God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people, in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. The consummated God will be the Husband of the New Jerusalem, the transformed, tripartite man. This is the conclusion of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WITHOUT THE SPIRIT, NO REALITY;<br />
WITHOUT THE SPIRIT, NO BODY OF CHRIST, NO CHURCH</h2>
<p>Without the Spirit, we have no reality. Without the Spirit, we have no Body of Christ, no church. In chapter two we have seen that the Spirit is the reality of the Body of Christ. Hence, if there is no Spirit, there is no Body of Christ, no church. The reality of the Body of Christ is the Spirit whom we have received, experienced, and enjoyed in many aspects, and the church life is the very Spirit in whom we live and according to whom we walk. It is this Spirit that makes the church organic. The organic factor of the church life is altogether the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>As a concluding word to our fellowship in this book, I would like to fellowship my burden in studying all these items concerning the organism of the Triune God in the organic union of His divine Trinity. You need to consider what we would be if we were all active in this organic union. You may love the Lord, but you need to ask yourself&mdash;are you organic, living, active, and capable in preaching the gospel to get sinners saved for the Lord? You may have preached the gospel out of your love for man, but you must confess that you have not been that organic, living, active, and capable. You may have spent much time in the past to bring people to the gospel preaching meetings so that they could be saved, but you were not organically capable to talk to these ones about the gospel. When I preached the gospel to a large gathering, many saints would come to me after the meeting with their unbelieving guests so that I could bring them to the Lord. These saints had a heart for the gospel, but they did not have the capability to talk to people concerning the gospel. In the preaching of the gospel, most of the saints are not that organic, living, active, and capable. If you would receive the fellowship in this book and practice it, I believe that within a short time you will be organic, living, active, and capable in saving sinners. You will be able to have a small gospel preaching meeting with a new one and his family.</p>
<p>I would also like to ask another question&mdash;how many young saints, how many new believers, are under your care? You may be taking care of someone, yet you do not know how to help him because you have not been organic, living, active, and capable. If you would take the grace to get into the fellowship in this book and live according to the organic union for a period of around six months to a year, you will not only have a heart to take care of the young ones, but you will also be organic, living, active, and capable in taking care of them.</p>
<p>The speed of the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is too slow, and the rate of increase is too low. There are not many churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery that have over one thousand saints. If our children were the only ones who were gained for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we would still increase, but our rate of increase has been too low. We may baptize ten people, but it may be that not even two of them would remain. This is because there are no nursing mothers to take care of them. A newborn child needs a nursing mother&rsquo;s care. If we would take the fellowship in this chapter to live an organic life, we will be organic, living, active, and capable in preaching the gospel to save sinners and in taking care of the new ones, the young ones.</p>
<p>You may have a heart to preach the gospel and to take care of new ones, but you may not have the capability because for years your Christian life and church life have not been organic. They may have been too much according to organization and arrangement. If ten new ones are baptized, you may be assigned by the church to care for two of them. You may try your best to take care of them, but eventually you will become disappointed. You may go to visit these new ones, but they will not get helped because you have not been helped yet. Since you have not been helped, how can you help others? This is the real situation because we have not been living our Christian life and church life in an organic way. A pastor of a certain denomination decided to divide the congregation into small groups. These small groups were to come together during the week for fellowship, and certain ones were assigned to be leaders of these small groups. Eventually these small group gatherings had to be stopped because none of the participants knew what to do. Why was this the case? It was because the members had not been perfected to live an organic church life.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11 and 12 say that the gifted ones perfect the saints to do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ. Verse 16 says that the Body will build up itself through the joints of the supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. This means that every member of the Body is operating and working. But how can each one part work without being perfected? The fellowship in this book is to help us to wake up and reconsider our way. Is our way of meeting organic or organizational? Every bit of the church life must be organic, not organizational. Everything organic is in the Spirit and full of life.</p>
<p>If we practice the fellowship in this book, we will be organic, living, active, and capable. Because we have received the help, we will know how to talk about Jesus with the unbelievers and how to take care of the young ones. Because we have been perfected, we will know how to perfect others. Because we have a living and an organic Christian life and church life, we will be capable of helping others in a small group meeting. Furthermore, when the whole church comes together, everyone will have something to say according to the truth revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26. Whenever we come together, each one will have something. This is different from today&rsquo;s practice of one speaking and the rest listening. We need an organic Christian life plus an organic church life. We must wake up and reconsider our way. Will we be satisfied with our present situation? Should we continue in the same way for another ten years? Surely we should not. Then what shall we do? We must be organic in our Christian life and in our church life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
