   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SEVENTY-SIX GOD S ECONOMY TO WORK CHRIST INTO US Scripture Reading: Eph 1:19-20; 2:10; 3:8; 4:13-15; 5:29-30, 32</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that God s economy is Christ with the church and that the word economy denotes a dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s intention is to dispense Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be saved is not merely to have our sins forgiven, to be justified, and to be made ready for heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be saved is for God to begin dispensing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>WHAT GOD IS SEEKING TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s dispensation is altogether related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the natural concept, we think that after salvation we need to improve our behavior, seek power, or carry on a fruitful work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some Christians believe that they need to pursue such gifts as speaking in tongues, prophecy, and healing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Others feel that the most important thing for a saved one is to gain the proper knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, if we view salvation from the perspective of God s economy, we shall see the Christian life in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Testament does speak of proper conduct, power, gifts, and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, the crucial point is how much of Christ has been wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is seeking to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all need to be enlightened to see what God is doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s intention is not to improve us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever we are in ourselves means nothing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What matters to Him is that Christ is wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1:19 and 20 Paul speaks of the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This power was wrought in Christ when God raised Him from among the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today God s main activity is to work this Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>OUR NEED FOR CHRIST TO LIVE IN US</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose one day you are unpleasant with another brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Surely you would repent and ask the Lord to forgive you for your poor attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may even pray that the Lord will make you better.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if you do not make this request specifically, deep within this is your feeling as you pray about your failure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This kind of prayer is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may have read the book Christ versus Religion, but you are still very religious in your daily practice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you see God s economy, you will pray like this, Lord, the Devil within me caused me to behave in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But, Lord, even if my behavior had been good, it still would not have been You living within me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lord, You do not want me to be good You want to live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, in one sense, I do repent and ask You to forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But I also put the blame on Satan and command him to get away from me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lord, I will not try to be better.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I just need You to live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Galatians 2:20 says that we have been crucified with Christ and that Christ now lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may have some knowledge of this verse and declare, It is no longer I, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, in our daily living it is no longer Christ, but I. To recite Galatians 2:20 is one thing, but to live out Christ in a practical way is another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose you are very kind to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may not sense any need to repent or ask the Lord to forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, according to God s evaluation, it makes little difference whether you are kind or unkind toward others as long as you are the one living and not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether our behavior is good or bad, we still do not live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s economy is focused on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His economy is not a matter of ethics, morality, or good character.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In His economy God desires to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In our relationships with the brothers and sisters in the church, we need to live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some books have been written about Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, it is difficult to find a group of Christians who genuinely live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God s intention is not to improve us; it is to work the living Christ into us, into our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s desire is to replace us with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He wants to see that Christ is being lived out of the brothers and sisters in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Oh, may the Father of glory give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we may be enlightened to know what God is seeking to accomplish today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I repeat, God is not seeking to improve us He is endeavoring to work Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Christ God is seeking to work into us is the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Satan put Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But God raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now God intends to work this crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is a great difference between ethics, conduct, and behavior, on the one hand, and such a Christ wrought into our being, on the other.</S>
