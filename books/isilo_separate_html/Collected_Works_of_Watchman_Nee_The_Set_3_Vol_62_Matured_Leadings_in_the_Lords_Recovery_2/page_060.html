This means that we are not ashamed. Not only is the spirit within us strong, but our skin is thick. This means we have no sense of self-consciousness or shame. Suppose our house was on fire. We would run to the street and shout. We would not be ashamed and would not be self-conscious. If we have a gospel spirit and see men walking away from salvation, how can we shut up and be ashamed of shouting when their soul is going to hell? We cannot be ashamed of the gospel. Whether or not others like to hear us, we have to preach. Church history shows that all those who are good at saving souls are "thick-skinned." They seem to be oblivious to everything. They are like fools to others. Those who are polite cannot save too many people, but those who have a strong gospel spirit and whose faces are thick will lead many to salvation.</p><h2 class="head3">Not Being Conscious of One's Own Status</h2><p>Those with a strong gospel spirit do not care too much about their own position or status. They can walk away from their own "throne." Some people are bank managers, college professors, gentlewomen, college students, and ladies, and their status is their throne. They are not willing to walk away from their throne to preach the gospel. But once the spirit of the gospel rises up in us, we will immediately forget about our status and position. We will forget about our throne and will care only to bring people to salvation. If we are beside ourselves for the Lord in this way, we will bring many to salvation. The kind of persons we are will be the kind of person we beget; it will determine the kind of person we bring to salvation. If we are lukewarm, those whom we bring to the Lord will also be lukewarm.</p><p>If we do not have these two traits, that is, if we will not give up our "face" and status, we will not have a strong gospel spirit. In order for us to have a gospel spirit, we must go to God and pray to Him to remove any hindrances. We must forget about our "face" and ignore our status and standing for the gospel's sake and for the sake of man's soul.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE GOSPEL</h2><p>In order to be effective in preaching the gospel, we must do two things. First, we must have strong, thorough, and powerful prayer before preaching. We have to carry men's souls to God. Next, we have to invite people in. We must not only carry men's names to God but also bring them in to listen to the gospel. This is the reason we must prepare a list and write the names of all the people we know on the list. Those who live around us should be invited to listen to the gospel. Those who live elsewhere should receive the gospel through the mail. I have a somber feeling that the church in Hong Kong is very much behind in the gospel spirit, in the matter of gospel preaching. If fifty brothers and sisters have the gospel spirit, we will fill our meeting hall with two hundred to three hundred people the minute we call a gospel meeting. The effectiveness of the gospel is based on two things: much prayer and a serious effort to bring in our friends and relatives. Those whom we drag in from the street are not very reliable. Friends and relatives are different. They are related to us already, and it is easy to touch them.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
