   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord spoke a parable in Matthew 20 concerning a householder looking for workmen for his vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to pay attention to two words, "standing idle."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The householder "went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place, and to those he said, You also go into the vineyard" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and said to them, Why have you been standing here all the day idle?...You also go into the vineyard" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This parable shows us that God does not want us to be idle; He wants us to work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It also tells us that God has His sphere of work His vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may say that we are very busy, and that we are not idle at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But are we busy in the right place?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are not working in the vineyard, how is that different from being idle?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are not living in the will of God, it does not matter how much we have worked; in the eyes of God we are still idle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may be very busy with our spiritual work, but in God's eyes we are very idle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The only work that God approves is work in the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The work in the vineyard is the work that is genuinely from God and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If our work is outside God's will, our days are idle days in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The householder told the ones standing at the eleventh hour, "Why have you been standing here all the day idle?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The entire day signifies man's whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, what about us?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are we idle, or are we working in the vineyard?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not be mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am not saying that we have to quit our job and be a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The most important thing is being clear about our standing and knowing that we are standing in the will of God in whatever we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To work in the vineyard means to work according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are many kinds of work in the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some are digging the ground; others are sowing; still others are trimming.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever we do, as long as it is for the vineyard, it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not consider that it is God's work only when we work as certain people do or only when we do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No, we do not have to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as our days are spent in the vineyard, they are counted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers and sisters, you may have been saved for three or five years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Or you may have been saved for ten or twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How much time have you spent for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is true that you have done much.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But for whom are you doing these works?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as you are sure that you are working according to God's will, everything will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has no intention that every Christian drop his job to be a gospel preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes it is contrary to God's will for someone to give himself up solely for gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a matter of your heart and how much it is towards God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, consecration is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From the day you were saved until now, if you have not had a heart for God, your life has been an idle one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>SIX</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul wrote to the Corinthians saying, "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But neither yet now are you able" 1 Cor 3:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As far as I know, from the time Paul first preached at Corinth until the time he wrote 1 Corinthians, there was only a span of a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But Paul already felt that the Corinthian believers were not growing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He did not say that they had been Christians for only a few years and that it was understandable that they were immature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul said that they should have matured.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet they had not grown and had wasted their days.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They should have been strong enough to eat solid food, but they had wasted their days and were still fleshly babes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They should have been experienced in their obedience to the Lord, in their trust of the Lord, and in their pursuit of the Lord, and they should have been able to lead others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But they still did not know about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They had been Christians for a number of years, but they were still babes, and Paul felt that this was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brothers and sisters, if you think that you should be a babe because you have been saved for only a few years, you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How many years do you have in your life?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How many years can you be a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you have been a believer for eight or ten years and are still the same as when you were regenerated fleshly and babyish you have wasted many days.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Brothers and sisters, how many years can you live on this earth?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Seventy years?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Eighty years?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How short your life is!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Within this short period, you have to subtract the years when you were not yet saved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How many years are left?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brothers and sisters, do you know how many more years you will live on this earth?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You have lived sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Perhaps God will say, "You have lived less than ten years before Me."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Or you may have lived fifty years, but God may say, "In My eyes you have only lived a few days."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It would be a pity if all your days were wasted away.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>SEVEN</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brothers and sisters, my heart aches when I think of the days you have wasted in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But thank the Lord that He has given you comfort; you have the words of Joel 2:25.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The years that the locusts have eaten will be restored to you.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Thank God that He has a way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Perhaps you are sixty years old and have wasted thirty to forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You have to say, "Oh, my opportunity is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>My best days have been eaten up by the locusts, and the lost days cannot be recovered again.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What can I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thank the Lord that He will restore the days that were eaten up by the locusts.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you waste your days, ten years may be equal to one day.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But if you redeem the time, one day may equal ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>David said, "For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand" Psa 84:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The days in heaven are not counted by a twenty-four hour cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God has a different way of counting days.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If our service is according to God's will, one day will equal many days.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There was once a young man who fell into sin and was about to die of tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>An old servant of God went to him and preached about Jesus taking away sins.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He exhorted him to repent, confess his sins, and accept the Lord Jesus as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>At first the young man thought it was a hard thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He doubted whether a sinner such as he could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But eventually, he accepted the Lord and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He was filled with joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>A few days later, the old servant of God went to see him again and noticed that he was full of sorrow and sadness again, and he asked, "Why are you this way?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Do not allow the devil to deceive you!"</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He answered, "No, I know that my sins are forgiven."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The old servant asked, "Why then are you still so sorrowful?"</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He answered sadly, "My days on earth are about over.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When I stand before the Lord, what should I bring to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>My hands are empty!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>How can I go to the Lord empty-handed?"</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He was sorrowful because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The old man said to him, "Brother, it is all right!</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Use the very words that you have just said as the subject and write a hymn about it.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Perhaps some will be touched by this hymn and will go out to preach and to gain some others.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The reward will then go to you."</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The hymn that he wrote is the famous one, "Must I Go, and Empty-handed," Hymns, #930 .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Many have been touched by this hymn to become zealous for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Although this young person lost many of his years, he had a heart for the Lord at the close of his life, and the Lord fulfilled his wish.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Brothers and sisters, let us all number our days!</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>May the days that we have lost be restored to us, and may each day of our life be worth a thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>May we all walk step by step in the light of God's will!</S>
