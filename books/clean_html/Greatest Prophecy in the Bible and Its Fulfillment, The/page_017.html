<h2 class="head1">COMING BACK TO GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PURPOSE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to build up a Body for Christ today, not tomorrow. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to build up a spiritual house for Himself on this earth, not in the heavens. But millions of Christians today will not care for this. They care for thousands of other things. Some care only for Bible studies. They say that as long as we have people read and study the Bible, we will do a good work. They do not care for the church, the Body, the building. Others care only for missionary work. Some care just for a good service. They spend millions of dollars to build up a physical sanctuary in a modern design. Satan uses many things, including the best knowledge, doctrine, forms, and regulations. He uses whatever he can to distract every Christian from God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Now the Lord has enlightened our eyes, and He has burdened us to say that we have to come back to God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>The best way for you to be snatched out of any part of this satanic system is to put everything you received from the past under your feet. We should care only for eating Jesus so that we may grow and be transformed for God&rsquo;s building. Many people read the Bible and do religious things, but they have never really eaten Jesus as their spiritual food. Instead, they just pick up the knowledge, the doctrine. Today our eyes have to be opened. The Christian life and the church life are altogether a matter of eating Jesus. When we call on the Lord&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;we take the Lord Jesus in. To be religious and to take the mere knowledge of the Bible fit in with our fallen human, religious nature. We need a vision and a revelation of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT<br />
TO HAVE RIVERS OF LIVING WATER<br />
FLOWING OUT OF OUR INNERMOST BEING</h2>
<p>All the points we have covered in our fellowship are in the Bible, but many people do not see them, because they do not fit their natural, fallen concept. Christians easily pick up the verses in Ephesians 5 concerning wives submitting to their husbands and husbands loving their wives (vv. 22, 25), because these kinds of verses do not need any revelation. Anyone can understand them. But Paul also said in the same chapter that we are to be filled in spirit (v. 18b). In order to understand this verse, we need revelation. We need to be renewed and enlightened with the divine revelation from the holy Word.</p>
<p>Peter said that as newborn babes we should desire the pure milk of the word so that we can be the living stones for God&rsquo;s building. Who pays attention to this? Instead, many pay attention to the mere ethical teachings in the Bible. The Chinese already have the ethical teachings of Confucius. The Bible only teaches wives to submit to their husbands, but Confucius teaches a threefold submission. He says an unmarried daughter has to submit herself to her father. When she gets married, she has to submit herself to her husband. If her husband dies, she has to submit herself to her son. This is a submission to three generations. Many Chinese who learned the Confucian teachings feel that they do not need the Bible since they already have high ethical teachings. When I was a young person in China, I was bothered by this. Even the Western missionaries said that the Bible teaches the same thing as Confucius. When we heard this, we wondered why they needed to come there, since we already had Confucius. But eventually I was saved, and my eyes were opened to see that there is no comparison between the Bible and the teachings of Confucius. People said that the Bible and Confucian teachings were the same because they did not see God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. They saw only the outward things in the Bible. Outwardly, a wax figure looks like a real person, but within it there is no life. Today many Christians take just the superficial things. They do not see the deep things.</p>
<p>Actually, the virtues of submission, love, obedience, care, and all the other virtues of a proper Christian life, church life, family life, and community life come out by our being filled inwardly in our spirit. When we are filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, spontaneously something comes out of us to submit to one another (Eph. 5:18-21). When we are filled in spirit, we will spontaneously and even unconsciously be submissive.</p>
<p>The Christian life is not a matter of outward behavior, outward conduct. It is altogether a matter that flows out of the infilling of God Himself. I am filled in my spirit with my Lord, so there is the fruit. John 7 says that when we drink of the Lord, the rivers of living water will flow out of us (vv. 37-39). This is not one river but many rivers. A river of submission, a river of love, a river of power, a river of wisdom, a river of patience, and many other kinds of rivers are flowing out of us. But the source is the infilling of Christ. When we are filled in our spirit with Christ, we have the flowing of many rivers out of our innermost being.</p>
