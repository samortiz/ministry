One woman can give birth to a twelve-ounce baby, whereas another can give birth to a twelve-pound baby. The church should bear the responsibility in its ministry to help the new ones to have a good beginning. There is a great difference between the way taken by those who have a proper beginning and those who do not. Among the ones raised up by the Lord throughout the ages, many did have a good beginning. Once a person has a good beginning, he can go on in a proper way. As long as the beginning is clean-cut, that one can go on properly no matter how little he understands and sees at the beginning. There are others who dragged their feet along when they first came in. With such, their way cannot be straight. Once a person is saved, he should have a clear-cut separation from sin and the world. The question of money has to be settled. The question of consecration has to be settled, and the question of individualism also has to be settled. What the future holds for a person depends on God. After Paul brought others to salvation, he committed those saved to the grace of God (Acts 14:23; 20:32). No doubt in the way ahead a person needs God's grace. But in the initial stage, there must be a clear-cut salvation. If the beginning is not good, the make-up lesson later will not be easy.</P><P>Brother Tang asked: Is it one thing to go to God and another thing to go before man?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for the Work<br>of the Holy Spirit in the Gospel</H2><P>Brother Nee answered: There are six lines to take in preaching the gospel. One can start from love, righteousness, judgment, sin, the world, or vanity. However, no matter which line you take, there is the need of the work of the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is just one thing: to subdue a person. The real gospel is one that subdues and softens a person. All those who think that they are doing God a favor by believing in Him are unqualified ones. Once a person sees the gospel, whether it is through the preaching of love, righteousness, or judgment, he will surely be softened and subdued.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Center of the Gospel<br>Being God</H2><P>When we preach the gospel, we have to present the proper way to others. The question of the world and of our service to the Lord must be dealt with together. We have to see that the center of the gospel is God and not ourselves. It is not that we gain something for ourselves, but that God gains something for Himself. As soon as a person is saved, he has to realize that everything belongs to God. Our occupations are not ours; they are God's. The doctors have to see that their occupation is not to be a doctor, but to serve God. They are only working as a doctor on the side. If a man is not willing to take this way or to accept the Lord and be baptized, we will not force him to do so. But we cannot lower the standard. As soon as a person is saved, we have to tell him that from now on he is no longer an individual person, but a member in the Body. As such, he needs to learn to listen to others and to submit to others.</P><P>If the church will not take this way, it will always remain sub-standard. If Brother Tang drinks cow's milk today, no one would laugh at him. But if he still takes his mother's milk, it would be a big joke. Strictly speaking, the church should have learned obedience already. But now it is going back to re-learn this lesson. This is why, in order to take the straight way today, we have to put everything upon a person the day that he is saved. Those who are saved must begin in a proper way.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_122.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_124.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 123</div><br></body></html>
