   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT'S INDWELLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Holy Spirit is inside a believer; but the believer either does not know it or he fails to obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, he must know the Holy Spirit who indwells him and completely obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believer must know that God's Holy Spirit, being a person, indwells him to teach, guide, and give the "reality," the truth, in Christ to the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This work of the Holy Spirit can be done only after the believer acknowledges how ignorant and dull his soul is, and he decides that, even though he is foolish, he is willing to be taught.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The believer must be willing to let the Holy Spirit take hold of everything and reveal the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the believer knows that God's Holy Spirit dwells in the deepest part of his being, in his spirit, and waits for His teaching, then the Holy Spirit can work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we do not pursue on our own and are completely willing to be taught, the Holy Spirit can teach us the truth in a way that our mind is able to digest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, there is danger.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we know that within us there is a spirit, God's Holiest of all, which is deeper than mind and emotion and is able to fellowship with the Holy Spirit and when we wait for God's Holy Spirit, then we know that He truly indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we confess Him and honor Him, He will manifest His power and work from that hidden place inside us and will allow the life of our soul and consciousness to have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Corinthian believers were fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Paul persuaded them to leave their fleshly situation, he exhorted them more than once that they were the temple of the Holy Spirit and that the Holy Spirit was indwelling them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Knowing that the Holy Spirit indwells a believer is a help in getting out of the fleshly situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The believer must know by faith, know entirely, know clearly, and know constantly that the Holy Spirit indeed indwells him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The believer should not only know the doctrines in the Bible that speak about the Holy Spirit; he should know the Holy Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With this kind of knowledge, the believer should commit himself unreservedly to the Holy Spirit to be renewed and willingly submit the various parts of his soul and body to Him, allowing Him to guide and correct.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The apostle asked the Corinthian believers saying, "Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1 Cor 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He seemed to be astonished at their lack of awareness of such a sure thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He considered the indwelling of the Holy Spirit to be the very first result of salvation, yet they did not know this!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It does not matter what the believers' level is, even a level as low as the Corinthian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a pity it is that many believers may not be higher than them!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They should clearly know this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without knowing this, a believer will be fleshly and unable to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you have never experienced His indwelling, have you ever known in faith that He indwells you?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we consider how the Holy Spirit is God, how He is one of the Triune God, how He is the life of the Father and the Son, and then further consider His honor and how He indwells us, who are fleshly, we will surely fear, honor, and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus took the likeness of sinful flesh, and the Holy Spirit dwells inside the likeness of sinful flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What grace this is!</S>
