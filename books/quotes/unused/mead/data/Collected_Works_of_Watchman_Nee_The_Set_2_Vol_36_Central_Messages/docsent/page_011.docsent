   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Philippians 2:14 says, "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The apostle told us that it is God who operates within us to will and to work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The result of such operation is obvious: the saints will be in harmony with one another, and there will not be murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To have no reasonings means to have no doubt or wavering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To have no murmurings means to be able to believe and to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 13 says that God's life is working in us, while verse 14 tells us of the resultant perfect harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only does Philippians speak of this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can find similar examples in Ephesians and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After Ephesians 3:19 speaks of being "filled unto all the fullness of God" verses 20-21 being words of praise , 4:2-3 immediately speaks of "all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love, being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God's power operates within a believer, the resultant outward manifestation among the believers is peace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Colossians 1:11 says, "Being empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The might of God's glory is God's great power.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may think that once we receive the might of God's glory, we will be able to perform miracles, do works of wonders, and accomplish unimaginably great things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Little do we realize that the result is nothing other than endurance and long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet this is the ultimate expression of God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is harder to endure a bothersome believer than to pray to God and ask for an answer to our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is hard to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet God's power can make us able to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All three books tell us that when we receive the operation and filling of God's power, we will have peace with others, and we can endure and suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Philippians 2:15 says, "That you may be blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be blameless is to be irreproachable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be guileless is to be inwardly simple and not double-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Crooked means something that is not straight, while perverted means to come apart or to become disjointed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This verse tells us that a Christian is set apart from the generation which has deviated and become disjointed from God's will; he is simple and blameless, and is a light in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To shine is an expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 16 says, "Holding forth the word of life, so that I may have a boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some believers think that they can lead others to Christ by their good works, and that there is no need for them to open their mouth to testify.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But only ignorant believers would say this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should hold forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should present to others the word of life; we should lift it up high so that others may see it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not only testify with our life, but also testify with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible never says that witnessing is only done by our life and not by our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Among our relatives, friends, and those whom we have contact with, we should open our mouth to testify.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, we have not held forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While Matthew says, "You are the light of the world" 5:14 , it also says that we should confess the Lord's name 10:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you can believe and work out what you believe, you should also believe that, in addition to shining, you can testify to those around you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul said if we do this, we are perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"The day of Christ" is the day when Christ reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To "run" refers to seeking out sinners and preaching the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To "labor" refers to our ministering to the believers, shepherding and teaching them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the apostle, if the believers would do the above things, they could boast in the day of Christ that they had not run in vain or labored in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 17 says, "But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and I rejoice together with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"The sacrifice and service of your faith" is the living sacrifice in Romans 12:1, which comes as a result of presenting our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to Paul, if the Philippians would do the above things, he was willing even to die with them and sacrifice his own life for them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If they would offer themselves as sacrifices to God, Paul was willing to sacrifice his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul had rejoiced before.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But now he would rejoice together with them all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 18 says, "And in like manner you also rejoice, and you rejoice together with me."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the last verse Paul was rejoicing, and was rejoicing together with them all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This verse says that they should rejoice and rejoice together with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who are under the operation of God's power have nothing to say except to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers and sisters, we should believe that God has done His work, and therefore we can work out what He has worked in. All we need to do now is be willing.</S>
