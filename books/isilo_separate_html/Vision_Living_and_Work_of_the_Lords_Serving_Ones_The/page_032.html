<p>Division issues in confusion, and confusion changes the nature of the church. Bible expositors agree that the woman in Matthew 13 signifies the Catholic Church. Since the second or third century, the Catholic Church has been an organization outside of God&rsquo;s economy. She has changed the church from an organism into an organization, and she has brought mixture into the church. Chapter 13 says that this woman took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened (v. 33). In the Bible leaven signifies evil things and evil doctrines. The leaven, mixture, in the Catholic Church, such as the worship of saints and relics, was taken from pagan practices. The Protestant denominations have not been delivered from this leaven. The confusion in Christianity is filled with superstition and different teachings.</p>
<p>Christianity is full of division; starting a so-called church is as simple as opening a restaurant. This is division. We do not condone such a situation. Furthermore, as a result of the division, there is much confusion. Division and confusion make it impossible for the Lord&rsquo;s desire to be satisfied; thus, there is a need for recovery.</p>
<p>Even the so-called ecumenical movement merely produces a superficial unity among Christian denominations and groups; essentially, they are still divided. Brother Nee said that this kind of unity is like shaking hands over a fence. This is not the way to resolve division; neither is it the oneness that God desires. John 17 says that God desires that we may be one as the Father and the Son are one (vv. 11, 22). God does not care for a unity that is outward, superficial, political, or of human maneuvering and arrangement. Hence, we do not acknowledge the &ldquo;oneness&rdquo; of the ecumenical movement as the genuine oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE NEEDING TO COME<br />
OUT OF DIVISION</h2>
<p>What should our practice be? The Lord has not commissioned us to build on division or to strengthen division. In the Old Testament God did not replaster a house that was plagued with leprosy. Rather, He commanded that the house be broken down (Lev. 14:44-45). In the New Testament God has no intention to improve Babylon, which represents the religious world. Instead, He calls His people to come out of her (Rev. 18:4). Hence, we must not take part in the division in Christianity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENTRUSTED WITH THE TESTIMONY<br />
OF ONENESS IN A LOCALITY</h2>
<p>Since we were raised up by the Lord to take His way, we need to return to the proper ground, the ground of oneness. This ground is not based on a particular teaching or a particular person but on the fact of the oneness of the Body of Christ. Since the Body of Christ is one (Eph. 4:4), our standing testifies to the universe, to the unbelievers, and to the devil that we are one. The ground of oneness is the ground of the church, and it is expressed in a locality. It is what we refer to as the ground of locality. The ground of locality is based on the ground of oneness. How do we practice this oneness? Due to physical limitations of time and space, we cannot meet with all the believers on the earth at the same time in the same place. God has revealed to us from the Bible that there is only one church in one locality; hence, we should meet together with the saints in that locality.</p>
<p>This is the arrangement of God in the New Testament. It is not man&rsquo;s idea or man&rsquo;s philosophy; it is the arrangement of God from the formation of the church. Many Christians preach the gospel and lead new believers to know the Bible, to know life, and to know the truth. However, they cannot go further because they have nothing else to say. In contrast, we go to people with a commission. Our speaking of the truth must be clear and as transparent as crystal. Our attitude toward people must not be rude, and our presentation of the truth must be proper and candid; we do not hide anything. The truth is the truth, and lies are lies. Eventually, the truth speaks for itself. We stand on the ground of oneness in our locality; this ground cannot be changed. Many children of God are not standing on this ground; they may even love the Lord more than we do and be more consecrated, more absolute, and more spiritual than we are. Nevertheless, spirituality is one thing, and the ground is another thing.</p>
<p>A brother asked how we can say that we are the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and others are not, when he knows a brother in Christianity who reads the Bible, prays, is spiritual, and has the Lord&rsquo;s presence. We must understand that having the Lord&rsquo;s presence does not make us the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In Matthew 18:20 the Lord said that where there are two or three gathered into His name, there He is in their midst. This shows that the Lord&rsquo;s presence is everywhere. The Bible says that the Father &ldquo;causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust&rdquo; (5:45). If the evil can receive sunshine and the unjust are watered by the rain, the children of God can have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Hence, having the Lord&rsquo;s presence does not mean that you are standing on the proper ground. We must see that standing on the ground of the church and being spiritual are two separate issues.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
