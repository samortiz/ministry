   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e. Dealing with the Old Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the old creation we are the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The old man is lived out in the flesh and is inclined to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we were the old man, the old husband, we were under the bondage of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whatever we were or whatever we did was unto death 7:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, Christ has come, and the old man has been crucified with Him as the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20; 6:14b .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the old man has been crucified, the regenerated man is now free from the law of the old man Rom 7:3-4, 6; Gal 2:19 ; hence, we are no longer under the law but under grace that we may live to God. f.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Dealing with the Old Creation</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15b , Christ died on the cross in the old creation, and through such a death He terminated the entire old creation and accomplished redemption for all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The entire old creation is typified by the cherubim on the riven veil in the temple Exo 26:31; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1:5, 10; 10:14-15; Matt 27:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Luke 23:44-45 says, "And it was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour, the sun's light failing; and the veil of the temple was split down the middle."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Darkness here is related to sin, whereas the veil typifies the flesh of the Lord Jesus, because Hebrews 10:20 refers to "a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The cherubim embroidered on the veil which was split at the Lord Jesus' death represent all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that when Christ died in the flesh, He brought all creation with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the veil in the temple was split, the cherubim embroidered on the veil were also split.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that when Christ was crucified in the flesh, all the creatures were crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through this, all the created things, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens, were reconciled to God Col 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, Hebrews 2:9 clearly says that Christ tasted death not only on behalf of everyone but also on behalf of everything. g. Dealing with Ordinances</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By passing through death Christ dealt with sin, Satan, the world, the flesh, the old man, and the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, His death was also for the creation of the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to create the one new man, Christ had to abolish all the ordinances and all the different customs of living, habits, traditions, and practices among human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, as the Peacemaker Christ created all His believers, both Jews and Gentiles, in Himself into one new man Eph 2:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only are there barriers between the Jews and the Gentiles, but there are also barriers among the nationalities and races.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Unless these barriers are removed, we cannot be one in Christ as the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Praise the Lord, on the cross Christ has abolished all the ordinances!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now in the church life, regardless of our race, color, nationality, status, and habits of living, we can be built together to become the Body of Christ as one new man. h.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Releasing the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the negative persons, things, and matters in the universe, including sin, Satan, the world, the flesh, the old man, the entire creation, and the ordinances were dealt with through the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the positive side, as the grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying, Christ released the divine life John 12:24 and imparted it into us so that, like Him, we may become many grains to be made into one bread as His Body 1 Cor 10:17a .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, He accomplished an all-inclusive death.</S>
