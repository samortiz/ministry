   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN CREATED TO BE JOINED TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why did God make us so similar to Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was so that one day man might be grafted into God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Zechariah 12:1 the Lord is described as the One who "stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Notice how the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man are put together as the three important things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The heavens are for the earth: without sunshine, water, and air, all of which come from the heavens, the living things on the earth could not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The earth is for man: without the provisions that come from the earth, man could not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is man for?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Zechariah refers here to the creation of man, he does not mention the body, but rather the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To have man, God first stretched forth the heavens, then laid the foundation of the earth; then He formed "the spirit of man within him."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When all the physical things in the universe were ready and could provide man with a suitable environment, God put man on the scene.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He formed the spirit of man to be a container for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our spirit is the organ by which we contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Notice this series: the heavens, the earth, the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the whole universe these are the three most important matters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Treasure your spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is as significant as the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Zechariah could have enumerated countless other items created by God, but only these three are listed together, because these are directly related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All these were created so that God might obtain a group of people to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are vessels of honor and glory because we contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A diamond ring is usually kept in an attractive velvet box.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because the ring is so precious, it needs a beautiful container.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The box is honorable and glorious because of the diamond ring it contains.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We in ourselves may be only a box, but within us is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you realize what a treasure you have in this earthen vessel?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Does it not excite you to have such a precious diamond in your possession?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The value of this diamond cannot be measured in carats.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No scale can weigh it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is limitless and immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God Himself is your marvelous, glorious content!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Within this man, who was created in the image of God, is a receiver, like a radio; this is his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once this receiver is turned on, God comes in. Man is not only close to God, but similar to Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>GOD PROCESSED TO BE JOINED TO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although man from his creation was designed to receive God, God at that time was not ready to be received into man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not until some four thousand years later did God initiate the process by which He could be joined to man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not think that four thousand years is a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In God's eyes it is like four days cf.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Psa 90:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God came in human form, not in a majestic way but in a humble way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He passed through the womb of Mary and through the manger.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He escaped to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then He went to Galilee, where He grew up in a carpenter's home in the village of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He spent thirty years there, working as a carpenter, known to those around Him as Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet this One, the Child born to us, also has as His name "The mighty God" Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then He came forth to minister for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was persecuted and rejected by His own people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Finally the time drew near, and He talked to His disciples, explaining to them that He would be going to the cross, where He would pass through death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By this means He would not only redeem them; He would also change His form.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No longer would He be restricted by His physical body from entering into them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No longer would they be in one place and He in another.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No longer would He be only with them; He would actually be in them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After His death and resurrection, He as the last Adam would become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"The Spirit," John tells us in 7:39, "was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This term, the Spirit, is significant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Spirit of God is mentioned numerous times in the Old Testament, yet "the Spirit was not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the Lord Jesus emerged from death and was resurrected, He was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Not until this happened was there "the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Spirit of God is like a glass of plain water.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we add various ingredients to it, like tea and honey, it becomes a refreshing drink.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before these are added, the water is there, but the drink "is not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What are the ingredients added to the Spirit of God?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Before the Lord's death and resurrection, there was only God in the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But through the incarnation the Lord Jesus put on humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In resurrection this humanity was brought into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His death was also an element that was added to the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This death was precious and lovable, not like the death of the first Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It encompasses redemption; the termination of the past; the dealing with the self, with the old man, and with all the other negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is salt in this drink also, added not only for improving the flavor, but also to kill germs.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Besides death, in the Spirit are found also resurrection, ascension, glorification, enthronement, dominion, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In essence the Spirit is the Triune God Father, Son and Spirit as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the ultimate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>With this understanding of the Spirit, verses like those in Romans 8 about the Spirit should be clear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whenever you come across this term, the Spirit, in your reading of the New Testament, remember that it refers to the Triune God, passing through a long process and thus becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
