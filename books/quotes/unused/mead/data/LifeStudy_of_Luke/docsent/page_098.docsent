   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING CHRIST FAITHFULLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO RECEIVE THE REWARD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today everyone who accepts God s invitation and receives the offer of what He has prepared for us has the ground to participate in the New Testament jubilee and enjoy Christ in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in order to receive the reward of the jubilee in the coming age, we need to enjoy Christ faithfully in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many saved ones are not faithful to enjoy Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, God has set up a reward as an incentive that we may enjoy Christ faithfully in this present age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do not enjoy Christ faithfully today, we shall lose the enjoyment of Christ in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here we see that in His wisdom God has made the enjoyment of Christ in the coming age a reward for the faithful ones, the ones who enjoy Christ faithfully in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christians have neglected a number of important matters in God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One of these matters is the reward given to the faithful ones in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Most fundamental Christians emphasize God s salvation, but they do not pay any attention to God s reward.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This reward in the coming age has been set up by God as an incentive to encourage all the Lord s believers to enjoy Him and follow Him faithfully in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have pointed out that there are no terms, no conditions, for enjoying Christ in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as we believe in Him, accepting God s invitation and offer, we may enjoy Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, we need to enjoy Him faithfully in order to receive the reward in the coming age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Otherwise, we shall lose the enjoyment of Christ in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The kingdom will be a reward in the thousand years to the faithful enjoyers of Christ, and that reward will also be a jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today s jubilee is real, but it is only a foretaste, not the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has presented us such a foretaste, and we need to have a high regard for it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So many Jews have excused themselves from accepting God s invitation and have denied this jubilee and as a result cannot share its enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we Christians have accepted God s invitation and His offer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we are on the right ground to enjoy this jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet we still need to be faithful to enjoy the jubilee; that is, we need to be faithful to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many genuine believers, truly saved Christians, are not faithfully enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these unfaithful ones will miss the jubilee in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that they will miss the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all need to see that today s jubilee is a matter of salvation, that the jubilee in the coming age is a matter of reward, and that the jubilee in the new heaven and new earth will be the full taste of God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the New Testament, God s kingdom today is Christ as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This enjoyment is the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The kingdom of God, which is Christ Himself, has set us free from the bondage of sin, Satan, the world, and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The kingdom of God has also recovered our right to the divine inheritance, the right to enjoy the Triune God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today in God s salvation we have the right to enjoy Christ, the right to enjoy the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we must remain faithful in this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Properly and faithfully we need to enjoy God s Son who is the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This faithful enjoyment of Christ will qualify us to enter into the kingdom in the coming age and there to enjoy a fuller jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That fuller jubilee will be a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Receiving this reward requires the fulfillment of a condition, and this condition is that we faithfully and continually enjoy Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In our daily living we may fail to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you fail, simply repent and confess your failure, and the blood of Jesus will cleanse you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then you will be brought back to the proper enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may need to do this again and again, each time we fail.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When you go to bed at night, you may sense your failures that day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if you confess them, you will have a new beginning concerning the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every day we should exercise to keep ourselves in the faithful enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually, this is to keep ourselves in God by praying ourselves into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is also to keep ourselves in the kingdom of God for the enjoyment of Christ in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This enjoyment will then qualify us to enter into the coming kingdom, which will be a fuller jubilee as a reward to the Lord s faithful ones.</S>
