   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TASK IN THE WILDERNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What occupied the children of Israel during those forty years?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There was no industry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How did they spend their time when they were not traveling?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They began their day before sunrise, gathering the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition to preparing and eating it, they first built the tabernacle and then carried it all during their journey.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here is a clear picture of what we should eat, what we should be, and what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our diet is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should be those who eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should build up the church to be the dwelling place of God and then carry it as His testimony wherever we go.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The worldly-wise might have thought the Israelites were lazy and purposeless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why didn't they settle in one place and farm?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then they could grow onions, leeks, and garlic, instead of having only manna to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why did they do nothing but build a tabernacle and then carry it around with them?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In our day we may be criticized for not going to the mission field, for not engaging in this or that Christian work, or for not caring about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why is it we keep meeting together and pay little attention to anything other than Christ and the church?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not want to follow the pattern set by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, we would be like the Israelites of old, eating manna and caring for the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have such a testimony, souls will be won.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lovers of the Lord Jesus will be attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Young people, are you satisfied with such a life?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Your living is to eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Your work is to build the church with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your testimony is to carry the church with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE EXODUS ACCOMPLISHED</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the previous message on the tree of life, we pointed out that God's intention from the beginning was to be taken into man as food.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this message we have traced man's failure and the steps God took to recover man from death and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This triumphant exodus from condemnation and tyranny was brought about by the eating of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then for forty years in the wilderness God gave His people manna.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By this nourishment the tabernacle was built and His testimony set up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The book of Exodus, then, again reminds us that God's intention for man is to be his life, received in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When man thus partakes of Him, God's habitation is built and His purpose realized.</S>
