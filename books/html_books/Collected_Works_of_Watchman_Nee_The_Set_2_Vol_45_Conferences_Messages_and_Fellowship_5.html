However, there are variations in both structure and content.)</p><p>It is easy to deal with the sinful flesh, but it is very difficult to deal with the flesh that tries to please God. Before we are saved, we exercise the flesh in worldly things. After we are saved, we exercise the flesh in spiritual things. We preach with the flesh, we listen to messages with the flesh, and we worship God with the flesh. The subjects change, that is, we are not doing the same things as before, but the energy is not changed. We are applying fleshly energy to spiritual things. Our need is circumcision. Colossians 2:11 says, "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ." Brothers and sisters, has our flesh been put off yet?</p><p>Philippians 3:3 says, "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh." This means that if we are truly circumcised, we will no longer trust in ourselves. Sometimes people ask me why I do not give them a firm answer. I answer that if the Lord allowed me, I would give them a firm answer. A person who has been touched by the Lord does not make any suggestion lightly. Some are very bold; they even make suggestions for God. In the thirteen years following Abraham's begetting of Ishmael, he did not realize that he was living in the flesh.</p><p>God did not appear to Abraham again until he was ninety-nine years old. He said to Abraham, "Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised" (Gen. 17:9-10). The New Testament believers are the spiritual descendants of Abraham, and we also have to be circumcised spiritually. It is not a matter of being born in the house or being bought with money. It is a matter of whether or not the flesh is removed. The circumcision we receive is of our own free will; it is a sign of the removal of our flesh.</p><p>Since circumcision is a sign, those who have it bear a special characteristic which is not shared by all. It is good that some people have this mark. In the eyes of God whether or not a person is circumcised depends on whether his flesh is removed. A person who is genuinely circumcised will no longer trust in himself. He is always in fear and trembling. He dares not make his own proposals, and readily admits that he can be wrong. Because he has no assurance in himself, he dares not make proposals lightly and dares not express his own opinion easily.</p><p>When God promised Abraham that his wife Sarah would have a son, Abraham fell upon his face and laughed, saying in his heart, "Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old?" (Gen. 17:15-17). Abraham's laughing was the result of God's thirteen years of dealing with him. In spite of his laughter, Isaac came. How wonderful! When Abraham was young, he could bear children and he was confident of himself. But when he was old and could no longer bring forth children, he was brought by God to the point where he no longer had any trust in himself. In the past he trusted in his own strength. When he was old, he knew that he could no longer trust in himself. The younger Abraham only had a fifty percent trust in God, and other fifty percent of his trust was in himself. But in his old age he could only laugh. He had not only lost hope in himself, he had lost hope in God as well. In the past he had faith in himself and in God, but God was not pleased with him. In his old age he lost his faith in God and himself, but God came in to work and granted him great faith. Romans 4:18 says that beyond hope Abraham believed in hope. This shows us that Abraham's previous faith was mixed. At this point, his faith was purified. Abraham was not laughing at God. He was laughing at his own old age. We are like Abraham; when our circumstances are favorable, we do not look to God. We only look to Him when our circumstances turn unfavorable.</p><p>God does not want "arrogant" faith; He only wants us to have faith as small as a mustard seed. After he was circumcised in Genesis 17, Abraham no longer trusted in himself. By chapter eighteen he had become God's friend. Other than in Genesis 18, we find no other place in the Old Testament that tells us that God visited men. Of Abraham's three visitors, one was God and the other two were angels who later went to Sodom and rescued Lot. Abraham received God in his own tent, and communed with God. God told him that Sarah would have a child. The first time Abraham fell to his face and laughed. This time Sarah laughed within herself and said, "After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?" (v. 12). When Abraham laughed, God dealt with him, and when Sarah laughed, God dealt with her. He said, "Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? Is any thing too hard for the Lord?" (vv. 13-14). It was in this fellowship that God told Abraham of His intention to destroy Sodom.</p><p>Abraham signifies faith, while Sarah signifies grace. They cannot be separated. Once Abraham moved to the south, and dwelt in Gerar. He lied and told others that Sarah was his sister. As a result Abimelech separated Abraham from Sarah. But God would not allow this to happen. He punished the women in Abimelech's house so that they became barren (Gen. 20). Faith and grace cannot be separated. A man must have faith, and grace also must be added. When grace is added to faith, Isaac comes forth. If there is only faith without grace, Isaac will not come forth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE TESTING OF ABRAHAM<br />IN HIS OFFERING UP ISAAC</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: February 4, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded</h1><p>If Isaac had been put on the altar and burned, would not God's promise have been burned as well? Does this not mean that God's purpose in Abraham would have been annulled? Ishmael was begotten of the flesh, and it was possible to send him away. But Isaac was different; he was born of God's promise. Abraham could blame God and criticize God's way. He could say that God's way was being uneconomical, cruel, and unreasonable. He also could say, "Before Isaac was born, he was not mine. Now that he is born, why are You taking him away?"</p><p>Isaac was God's gift. God shows us through this story that our natural man cannot be attached to God's gifts. In spiritual matters we cannot hold on to anything by our flesh; we can only receive God's gift according to the spirit. What is gained through the flesh will eventually be cast out, and what is gained through the spirit cannot be retained by fleshly hands either.</p><p>We have to realize that God was the Father before Isaac was born. After Isaac was born, He was still the Father. God has to accomplish His own purpose. His purpose did not hinge on Isaac, but on Himself. After many people receive the gifts, they begin to pay more attention to the gifts than to God. This is wrong. Abraham learned his lesson in this matter. Even if we have received the best gift, we cannot neglect God. If God wants to take away this gift, we have to be willing to let it go. Abraham's experience shows us that his natural life and flesh had been dealt with by the Lord.</p><p>We should not be attached to our work. Instead, we should be attached to God. Once we become attached to our work, it is difficult for us to drop our work. Whenever we become attached to Isaac, we find that it is hard to drop Isaac. God told Abraham to offer up Isaac. This was a big test to Abraham. Would he choose God or would he choose God's gift? Praise the Lord, Abraham learned the lesson. He considered God as the greatest of all treasures, and he was willing to drop Isaac. In God's eyes Isaac had to pass through death. God demands the same thing in regard to our work and our gifts; He wants these things to go through death.</p><p>God's vessel and God's ministry are not constituted through the gifts. They are produced through experiences of God and the dealings from God. God's vessels are those who have a history of being dealt with by Him. The men that God uses are not merely eloquent or clever; they are not merely those who have a sharp memory. All the men that He can use are like Abraham, men who have been dealt with by God, who see their own weaknesses, who consider themselves as being dead, and who believe that God is the One who can raise Isaac from the dead.</p><p>May the Lord be merciful to us and open our eyes that we may see. We do not aspire to be a prophet like Balaam, nor do we aspire to be a judge like Samson, serving God with temporal energy. We aspire to be like Abraham who became a friend of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S PURPOSE IN CHOOSING ABRAHAM</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Gal. 4:29; 5:1; James 2:20-24; Gen. 21:8-10; 22:1-2, 5, 16-18</h1><p>Abraham did not look at himself. He was bold to pray for the women in Abimelech's house to have children. If he had looked at his own barren wife, he would not have had the courage to pray for the other women to bear children. He knew that everything depended on God and that nothing can change God's power. There is a difference between God as a father and God as the Father. God being our Father means that there is a life relationship between God and us. God being God the Father means that He is the Father in the Trinity. Everything is of Him; He is the Father of everything.</p><p>It was God's will for Sarah to cast out Ishmael; it was not a matter of Sarah's jealousy. Ishmael typifies Adam, while Isaac typifies Christ. When Isaac was weaned, Abraham cast out Ishmael. At that time Isaac was about fourteen to fifteen months old. What is the meaning of casting out? In the New Testament there is a casting out in Galatians 5:1, in which we see that the Christian life is not a matter of doing or not doing something. Whenever we try to do anything to please God, the law comes. Whenever we give up trying to do anything, grace comes. Spiritual things are absolutely different from earthly things. In the world an idle person is useless. But in spiritual matters, an idle person may be very useful, because we live by what we are rather than what we do.</p><p>God chose Abraham with three goals in mind: (1) to possess the earth, (2) to gain the seed, and (3) to bless the nations through him. Abraham was tested three times in the matter of possessing the earth. He was also tested three times in the matter of securing a son. First, he begot Ishmael with fleshly means and was dealt with by God to know that He is the Father. Second, he prayed for the women in the house of Abimelech and asked God to make them fruitful. Third, he offered up Isaac.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">ISAAC AND<br />THE GOD OF ISAAC</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Gen. 25:5-6, 11; 26:5-6, 23-24</h1><p>These verses show us that as far as God's purpose was concerned, Abraham was perfect. But as far as God's work was concerned, Abraham was not yet complete. There was the need of Isaac and Jacob before the work could be complete. "The God of Abraham" shows that God is the Father and that man's natural constitution and the flesh need to be dealt with.</p><p>All the blessings that God gave Isaac were blessings that He had promised to his father. Abraham did not receive these blessings; Isaac received them. He inherited all the blessings which God promised to Abraham. In Isaac we see clearly two things. First, we see the inheriting of the kingdom. In order to have the kingdom, we must pass through Isaac. Abraham was the father, and he had to learn to know God as the Father. Isaac was the son. No person in the Bible depicts Christ as the Son as clearly as Isaac. In the Old Testament only Isaac was not born of the flesh; he was born of promise. In the New Testament only Christ was not born of the flesh. Both Isaac and Christ are only begottens, both were offered up as sacrifices, and both were resurrected from the dead. Second, Isaac's life and experience were very ordinary. He did not do anything extraordinary. He was the son, and he was obedient in every way. When he was being offered up as a sacrifice, he did not say anything. He only asked his father: "Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?" (Gen. 22:7). When Abraham tied him up, he did not resist. When Abraham placed him on the altar, he did not resist. When Abraham asked him to come down from the altar, he came down. He was not married until he was forty years old, and the marriage was arranged by his father through an old servant. He happily accepted this marriage. Isaac did not propose anything and made no suggestions of his own. By the time he was sixty, he had two sons. During the famine years he went to Gerar and said that his wife was his sister. The lie he told was a repetition of his father's lie. When the Philistines covered up his well, he did not say anything. After he died, he was buried in his father's tomb. Isaac lived a very ordinary life.</p><p>In Abraham we know God as the Father. In Isaac we know God as the Son. Everything Isaac gained was gained through receiving. In Abraham we see God's goal and standard. In Isaac we see God's power and life and that He is the Provider. Everything that Isaac had was obtained and not attained. The Christian life originates from God; it is spontaneous and not artificial. There was only one question in Isaac's life: "Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?" The answer is: "Jehovah-Jireh"&mdash;the Lord will provide.</p><p>In Jacob we see something altogether different. He was a naughty, conniving, scheming, supplanting, and selfish person. The God of Jacob was not the God of provision but the God of discipline. Isaac found favor in the sight of the Lord, but Jacob was disciplined. Isaac represents the supply of the resurrection life of Christ, while Jacob represents the crushing of the natural life through the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The hollow of his thigh was touched, and he became crippled; he could no longer be naughty. Some people only see Christ's life and forget their own natural life. As a result their natural life creeps in. Some people only see the natural life, and forget the riches in Christ. We need the experience of Isaac as well as the experience of Jacob.</p><p>May the Lord open our eyes to see that Abraham represents God the Father, Isaac represents God the Son, and Jacob represents God the Spirit. In God's work there is the need of the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">THE GIFT OF CHRIST AND<br />THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded</h1><p>The victory of Christ is unlimited, but man-made victory is artificial and limited. Many people can overcome to a certain extent by their own power, but beyond that point they can no longer overcome. Some mothers can withstand one or two rowdy children. But if they have more, they can no longer endure. Man-made victory is limited. Only Christ's victory is unlimited. Christ is life to the believers. He is living within the believers and living for them.</p><p>The problem today is that believers will not stand on the ground of victory and allow the Lord to live out of them. On the contrary they try to live out their old self. Colossians 3:3-4 says, "For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory." This shows us the two aspects of Christ's work. On the one hand, the believers are in Christ. On the other hand, Christ is in the believers. Christ being in the believers means that He is our life, power, wisdom, righteousness, holiness, and redemption. The believers being in Christ means that we enjoy everything that Christ has accomplished including His crucifixion, burial, resurrection, and ascension. We should consider both aspects together. Some people see these two aspects at different times, while others see them at the same time. Personally, I saw my being in Christ first, then Christ in me two years later. If a Christian does not see these two aspects, he is like a person in a river, but who is thirsty, or he is like a person in a gold mine, but who goes away with empty pockets.</p><p>The God of Isaac speaks of God giving His Son to us. All we have to do is enjoy. The God of Jacob speaks of God disciplining us through the Holy Spirit. The God of Isaac speaks of God's gift, while the God of Jacob speaks of God's carving work. Paul often spoke apparently contradictory words. On the one hand he said, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 8:1). Our sins are cleansed through the precious blood of the Lord. We can be strong and victorious. Yet on the other hand Paul said, "Sinners, of whom I am foremost" (1 Tim. 1:15), and "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling" (1 Cor. 2:3). These words tell us about a God who is our enjoyment and who also disciplines us.</p><p>Some Christians try to reckon themselves dead (Rom. 6:11). But the more they try to reckon, the more they are alive. It is not a matter of reckoning ourselves dead, but a matter of whether or not Christ's death is a fact. The word reckon in the original language is a term used for bookkeeping in accounting. It refers to a definite fact. Reckoning ourselves dead is not a matter of feeling but a matter of fact. Our God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The God of Abraham speaks of God as our Father, the God of Isaac speaks of the gifts in Christ, and the God of Jacob speaks of the discipline in the Holy Spirit. We need to have a knowledge of all three aspects.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">JACOB AND HIS TRIALS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded</h1><p>In Jacob's life we see two sections. The first section was the time of God's disciplining, and the second section was the time of God's constitution. Genesis 25 through 27 is a description of the first period of his life. Beginning from chapter twenty-eight, we see the second period of his life. In this period God began to discipline him. During the third period of his life, his natural life was dealt with, and in the fourth period of his life, he brought forth the fruit of righteousness.</p><p>There are a few points worth considering about Jacob. First, his struggle with his brother while they were in their mother's womb reveals that he was not an upright person. Second, he wanted to be the firstborn, and he tried to come out of the womb ahead of Esau by holding his heel. Third, God had chosen Jacob before the foundation of the world. Therefore, it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy (Rom. 9:16). Fourth, although Jacob cheated for the birthright, his motive was proper. Fifth, Jacob escaped because he was afraid that his brother would kill him. Under such circumstances he was tested, disciplined, and dealt with by God. Sixth, Jacob saw God in his dream. Seventh, from his encounter with God in his dream during his escape to his uncle, Laban, we see that he feared God, but he did not remember God's promise. All he could remember was food and clothing. He asked God to take care of his physical needs. This shows his bargaining mentality. He should have realized that God's discipline had stripped him of his clothing and food.</p><p>Eighth, the reward of Jacob's work was Rachel, the one he loved. Today the reward of our service should be Christ, because Christ is our beloved. Jacob worked for Laban twenty-two years, and Laban changed his wages ten times. Yet Jacob persisted, because he had not gained what he wanted yet. The meaning of the name Rachel is a lamb, but Jacob was by no means docile. Therefore, God had to come in to discipline him. Jacob suffered all his life for the gaining of Rachel.</p><h2 class="head1">JACOB AT PENIEL</h2><p>God's dealing with man's natural life is a lifelong process. We can see this from the way He dealt with Jacob. Jacob spent twenty years learning his lessons under the hand of Laban. God was gracious to Jacob when he ran away with Laban's belongings. God warned Laban in a dream not to speak good or bad to Jacob.</p><p>At the crossing at Jabbok, God wrestled with Jacob, and God failed. Today many believers are as strong as Jacob was in their natural strength, and God has no way to deal with them. God did not prevail over Jacob; He could not subdue him, but He touched the hollow of his thigh. From this time forward, Jacob was crippled. The hollow of the thigh is the strongest part of a man; it is the very place that God touches. God's touching of the hollow of Jacob's thigh meant that Jacob's natural strength was dealt with. Jacob's turning point was at Peniel. From there he went on to Bethel. His destination was Bethel.</p><p>Sometimes God can deal with a person's natural constitution without that person realizing it. Jacob was unaware of the fact that his thigh was touched by God; he still asked God to bless him. Only when he began to walk did he realized that he had become crippled.</p><h2 class="head1">JACOB AND ISRAEL</h2><p>Throughout his early life Jacob never once confessed that he was wrong. This is why God had to deal with him. God did not preach to him; He merely came and wrestled with him. When can we say that a man has been touched in the hollow of his thigh? We can know that a man has been touched when he is crippled, powerless, and weak. This does not mean that he has to have some special kind of joy or that he has to break down in some kind of weeping. It is possible at times for some to have such emotional outbursts, but such outbursts are not crucial. After Jacob was dealt with by God at Peniel, his name was changed to "Israel."</p><p>Jacob did his best to arrange the right time for his wives and children to meet his brother Esau. He did not realize that God had already touched the heart of Esau. All of Jacob's labor and plans were futile. Shechem signifies God's power, while Bethel signifies God's house. A Christian's natural life must go through some fundamental dealings. The name Hebron means fellowship. God had no intention for Jacob to remain in Shechem or Bethel, because it is only in fellowship that we receive the supply of life.</p><p>The brightest portion in Jacob's history was in Genesis 47 to 49. This echoes the word that the path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more unto the perfect day, that is, unto noon&mdash;there is no afternoon. Someone said that it was impossible to deal with Jacob, and that even if changed, he could never reach perfection. But this was not the way he turned out.</p><p>Jacob was a busy man from the day he was born. At his birth, he held Esau's heel. He was an active person, and he always came up with schemes to deceive others. He was a cunning and supplanting person, true to the meaning of his name. He tried to take advantage of others and have the upper hand in everything. At the same time he was very diligent. God brought him through many experiences. His beloved Rachel died. Later, Joseph, the one he cherished the most, also met with calamities. In the end God even took his darling Benjamin. For thirteen years Jacob lived in sorrow. Later, on top of all these sorrows, a famine came.</p><p>In his old age Jacob became more sincere. He no longer reviled others. He became meek and feared God. He dared not make any decision by himself. A person who worships God must be like Jacob, who "worshipped God"&mdash;for God's leading in his whole life&mdash;"while leaning on the top of his staff" (Heb. 11:21). Although Jacob was a difficult person to deal with and although he was crafty, God dealt with him anyway. After he was broken by the Lord, he became a useful vessel who could bless others. He blessed all of his twelve sons, and the blessings were all eventually fulfilled.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY</h1><h1 class="title">THE WAY TO DISCERN</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: 1940 (Lord's Day)<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Gen. 15:1-4; 16:1, 15; 1 Cor. 2:14; 3:11-12; Gal. 4:23, 29; Heb. 4:12</h1><p>A man must have God's light before he can see his true condition. Without light the analysis and conjectures of human wisdom and ideas can only lead to error. Human judgment is untrustworthy. Discernment is not an exercise of our outward mentality; it comes through the enlightening of God within. May the Lord grant us light and show us the kind of things He wants to give to man. May He also show us what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad.</p><p>Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow." This verse speaks of the dividing of the soul and the spirit. First Corinthians 2:14 says, "But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually." This verse speaks of a soulish man and a spiritual man. In Hebrews 4 we only see a distinction between the soul and the spirit. In 1 Corinthians 2, not only is there a distinction in terms, but a distinction in function. In Greek, spirit is pneuma, while soul is psuche. Both words are nouns in Hebrews 4, and adjectives in 1 Corinthians 2.</p><p>Genesis 2:7 says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." The man God created was a living soul. The word soul in Hebrew is nephesh; it is the equivalent of the Greek word psuche. The substance of man is his soul. John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit." The spirit within man is the part he receives from God and inherits from Adam. Within man there is a soul and a spirit. A man who lives according to what he is and what he can do is a soulish man. First Corinthians 2 tells us that a soulish man cannot know the things of the spirit. In order to know the things of the spirit, one must be a spiritual man. The soul and the spirit belong to two entirely different realms.</p><p>If we look in a concordance, we can identify several hundred references to the difference between the soul and the spirit. Sometimes we find the expressions "sorrowing in spirit" or "rejoicing in spirit." We also can find the expressions "sorrowing in the soul" or "rejoicing in the soul." When theologians come across such passages, they lump the soul and the spirit together because of the similarities in their function, and they consider the two to be one thing. But it is absurd to say that because both you and I eat, we are the same person. The soul possesses functions that are similar to those of the spirit. However, the function of the soul has nothing to do with the things of the spirit. First Corinthians 2 says that the soulish man does not know the things of the spirit. Although there are similarities in the functions of the soul and spirit, they belong to two entirely different realms. Today God is not asking what we are doing; neither is He asking if we are happy or sorrowful when we do these things. He is asking only one thing: Are we doing it in spirit or in the soul? Man makes distinctions based on whether or not a thing is done well. But God does not make such distinctions.</p><p>When some believers see that the Bible records the soul and the spirit doing the same thing, they conclude that there is no difference between the soul and the spirit. God promised Abraham a son in Genesis 15, and Abraham begot Ishmael through Hagar when he was eighty-six years old. Although Ishmael was Abraham's son, God would not recognize him, because he was born through the flesh. Fourteen years later, when Abraham's wife Sarah begot Isaac, God recognized Isaac as Abraham's heir. What is the difference between Hagar and Ishmael, and Sarah and Isaac? Outwardly, there was not much difference. It is difficult to differentiate between the two, because they were very similar to each other. Only in Galatians 4 can we see the clear distinction. Man is satisfied as long as he has a son. But God is concerned with where the son comes from. Does he come from God's promise or from the flesh? God cares for the source of the son. A soulish man is independent from God, whereas a spiritual man trusts in God, looks to God, waits on God, and is humble before God. Outwardly, the two may look the same, but they are very different in reality.</p><p>Isaac and Ishmael were born of the same father. But God is concerned with who the mother is. Galatians tells us that this distinction also exists among believers. In our daily life we should ask: "Did I do this in the spirit or did I do this in the soul?" We should not ask: "Did I do it right or did I do it wrong? Was it good or was it bad? What is the result?" Most people think that it is a good thing to work for God. Once I was invited to a famous high school to work for the Lord. There was a good result, and many people were saved and their hearts were turned to love the Lord. Outwardly, I was very enthusiastic, but inwardly I was suffering. I felt like a deflated balloon. After I left, I told a co-worker, "I have to repent for my work here, because I did not do it according to God's timing."</p><p>Once a brother came to see me. I sensed that he was afraid of me. He made many humble remarks, but I detected that his humility was unnatural. It was something from his soul. I sympathized with him for his forced performance; it was something soulish. God does not ask whether or not we are humble. He only asks where our humility comes from. If a man is humble as a result of God's operation within, he will not be conscious of his humility. Only those who use cosmetics need to look in the mirror. Those who do not use cosmetics do not need to look in the mirror. Moses' face shone as result of the Lord's speaking, but he was not conscious of it. Similarly, soulish patience is exhausting, whereas divine patience is subconscious.</p><p>There were once two sisters who did not know how to relate to others. They felt that they could not sympathize with or love others. After they heard some messages, they realized that they should love. But it was easier for them to rebuke than to love. Many Christians act out their Christian life; they make their Christian life a kind of performance. We need God's light to shine on us and show us how many soulish elements we still have! Not only do we have to see that soulish evil is evil, we also have to see that soulish goodness is evil. We need to condemn the soulish evil, and we also need to condemn the soulish goodness. Not only is unnatural goodness false, even natural goodness is not spiritual. God wants virtues that come from the spirit. He is not after our naturally-endowed virtues. Man always confuses God-given virtues with natural virtues. We have to see that it is more difficult to remove the soulish goodness than to remove the natural evil. Man's natural endowments are limited, but the Lord's provision is unlimited. For example, human patience is limited. It is like an arm which can lift only a hundred pounds of weight; it cannot lift anything more than a hundred pounds. This same principle applies to our patience. If it is a patience from the Lord, it will surprise even us. We do not have to ask whether or not a thing is of the spirit or soul. If we do not know, it is useless even if we ask. What we need is God's light. Counterfeit virtues are worthless in the sight of the Lord. No naturally-endowed goodness can replace the things of the spirit. Sooner or later it will be destroyed.</p><p>Many people feel at the beginning of their Christian life that being a Christian is a wonderful thing. They regard this period as their golden era. However, they gradually begin to slip away from this initial state. Many Christians have experienced this. They feel this way because they are ignorant of the activity of the soul at the beginning of their Christian life. The Spirit of the Lord does not have much ground in them. God has to show them that many of their good works actually originate from the self. At times God allows frustrations to come upon them in order to show them that they cannot make it in themselves. When they look to the Lord, the Lord will lift them out of their frustrations. After these dealings they may still love others and may still be humble and patient. Their outward conduct may be the same, but the source of their virtues has changed. The root of their virtues is no longer the same.</p><p>First Corinthians 3:12 shows us two kinds of works. One is the building of gold, silver, and precious stones upon the unique foundation, and the other is the building of wood, grass, and stubble. Many believers ask, "What are gold, silver, and precious stones, and what are wood, grass, and stubble?" The Bible shows us that gold, silver, and precious stones are things that originate from God. They are the works of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, that is, the eternal grace of the Father, the redemption of the cross of the Son, and the perfecting work of the Holy Spirit. Wood, grass, and stubble are worthless materials. Man's glory is as wood and grass, and stubble is the waste product of grains. God is not concerned with the work we have done. He is concerned with the source of our work. In Matthew 10 the Lord did not ask us to give water to everyone. He only promises a reward to those who give water to one of the little ones. Here is the difference: one work is soulish and the other is spiritual. Gold, silver, or precious stones do not grow on the surface of the earth; they are always buried deep in mines. Man must dig deep into the mines before he can get these treasures. It is not an easy thing to find gold, silver, or precious stones. Wood, grass, and stubble, however, grow on the surface of the earth. They are readily available. If we stretch out our hands, we can grab handfuls of them. Things of the emotion are easily within grasp, but they do not have much spiritual value at all. Some donate money because their emotion is touched. Their offerings are based on their emotion. However, their offering does not carry much spiritual weight at all.</p><p>We must also mention the preaching of the gospel and teaching. If a gospel message or a teaching comes from much waiting, prayer, and suffering, the message or teaching is of gold, silver, and precious stones. But if a teaching is merely a display of eloquence, or if it is merely the result of a good mental capacity for stories and illustrations, the teaching is of wood, grass, and stubble. After one brother heard Mr. Sparks' preaching on Abel and Cain, he said, "There is nothing special about this message. I can hear this kind of message anywhere, and even I can preach this." But there is a difference between a message coming from God and a message coming from ourselves. A message from the spirit and a message from the soul produce different results. Teaching has nothing to do with speaking something unusual, novel, or new. The key to a message lies in its source. If a speaker is touching his spirit, his speaking will turn people to God. If the speaker is touched only in the soul, his speaking will only cause others to touch him. When Elisha passed by the house of the woman of Shunem, the woman said, "I perceive that this is a holy man of God, which passeth by us continually" (2 Kings 4:9). The Shunammite woman did not remark that Elisha was an expositor, moralist, or prophet. She only said that Elisha was a holy man of God. Some people are eloquent; they can expound the Bible very well. But when they speak, others cannot touch God in their speaking. Some people are not eloquent at all; their preaching is not attractive. But such men have face-to-face contact with God, and when others listen to them, they realize that within this person there is God, and that he knows God.</p><p>How can we discern whether something is of the spirit or of the soul? It has nothing to do with our studying, analysis, or judgment. When the light comes, we will know and see inwardly. The power of discernment comes from within; it does not come from outward observation. If someone comes to you and tells you to do this and that, you can be confused by his words. As believers, we have to ask God to give us an inward discernment. Mere outward improvements are useless.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, bless the above words. Without Your blessing, these words will only be an offense to You. Cleanse these words. Man is not worthy of working for You. The Son can do nothing in Himself; what He sees the Father doing, He does the same. None of our labor and striving counts unless it is based on the inward operation of the Holy Spirit. Deliver us from vain thoughts, and may the Holy Spirit operate more within us. May all those who hear this word find light within, and may they be able to discern what is of themselves and what is of the spirit. In Your name we pray, amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />THE NATURAL LIFE, THE OLD MAN, AND THE FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Gal. 4:19; 5:22-23; Heb. 12:5-7, 9-11; 1 Cor. 3:12, 14; 7:10, 17, 25; 11:11; Gen. 2:12; Matt. 28:19; 2 Thes. 3:5; Phil. 4:11-12; 1 Pet. 1:6-7</h1><p>For a new believer there is very little difference between the natural life and the old man. The natural life is the life that is created by God, while the old man is man's life after the fall. Before Adam sinned, he had the natural life. After he sinned, he had the life of the old man in addition to the natural life. Every person has the natural life. Only wooden statues do not have the natural life. But since man sinned, he not only has the natural life, but also the life of the old man.</p><p>Christ also had the natural life, but He did not have the life of the old man. Moreover, although Christ had the natural life, He did not live by it, but by the spiritual life. A believer needs to be dealt with in two areas: in his natural life and in the life of the old man. The life of the old man has been dealt with in Christ. Now he needs to deal with the natural life, that is, the life that tries to do good and practice morality.</p><p>First Corinthians 3:12 shows us that man's work in the eyes of God is of two kinds. One is the work of gold, silver, and precious stones. Gold and silver are minerals, while precious stones are a kind of compound. All of them are buried in the ground for a long time, and all of them need to go through a process of cutting. The other is the work of wood, grass, and stubble. This is the work of the natural life. Jacob's experience shows us that the natural life is something that must be dealt with by the Lord. Although Jacob had the right goal, he employed the wrong means. His goal was to have God's blessing, but he tried to acquire it by exercising his natural life. In the end God had to step in to deal with him.</p><p>There is a difference between sanctification in 1 Corinthians 1:30 and holiness in Hebrews 12:10. The former refers to Christ as sanctification to the believers, while the latter refers to the holiness wrought in the believers through sufferings. The latter is produced through discipline and constituted in the believers through the Holy Spirit. The result of this discipline is the fruit of righteousness. This fruit is not manufactured, but grown. All fruit grows in a spontaneous way. There is no need for a fruit tree to exert any effort to produce fruit; it bears fruit spontaneously. In the same way the fruit of the Holy Spirit is the result of the indwelling Christ being assimilated and produced by the believers. God's intention is not only for the believers to have Christ as their life, but for them to bear the fruit of Christ in their living.</p><p>A believer's reward in Christ is His living within the believers and living on their behalf. This is what Paul meant when he spoke about Christ being formed in the believers in Galatians 4:19. Through the Holy Spirit, Christ is wrought into the believers to the extent that for them to live is Christ.</p><p>Let me mention something about George Cutting (the author of Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment). When I was in England, I went to pray with him. At that time he was over ninety years old already. He prayed repeatedly: "Christ cannot be without me, and I cannot be without Christ." I did not say anything. He went on: "This is our living in union with Christ." His living was one which lived Christ. Only those who have never experienced the Lord's dealing would be so presumptuous as to say, "If all will be stumbled because of You, I will never be stumbled" (Matt. 26:33).</p><p>The Bible is the word of God. But some parts of the Bible are also the words of Paul. Many words in 1 Corinthians 7 are the words of Paul. Because the Lord was formed in Paul, and because for Paul to live was Christ, his speaking became God's speaking. In order to reach this stage, a believer's natural life must be dealt with thoroughly.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE PRIESTLY MINISTRY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Acts 13:1-2; Num. 16:1-3, 19-21, 31-32; 17:5, 8, 13</h1><p>God appointed two ministries in the Old Testament&mdash;the priesthood and the prophethood. These two ministries were distinct in the Old Testament and were borne by different men. For example, Moses, Samuel, and Isaiah were all prophets, while Aaron and his descendants were in the priesthood in the temple of the Lord. In the New Testament these two ministries are combined into one in the believers; we have inherited both ministries. In the church in Antioch there were a few prophets and teachers who served the Lord together. They were also priests serving in the priesthood.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR SERVICE BEING RELATED<br />DIRECTLY AND SOLELY TO THE LORD</h2><p>We have to see that all our work and service are for the Lord and are related directly and solely to Him. The works are not related directly to the church. Although we are working in and serving the church, our work and service are not related directly to the church; they are related directly and solely to the Head of the church. It is the Lord who has committed the work to us, and it is the Lord whom we serve. My left arm often helps my right arm. When the right arm cannot lift up a chair, the left arm will come to its aid. The left arm is not serving the right arm when it does this; it is merely serving the head. The left arm is directly related to the head. In the same way, all works that genuinely supply the church should be services that are directly rendered to the Lord. The priests' duty is to serve the Lord directly. Whatever we do in the church, whether preaching the gospel, teaching, edifying the saints, nourishing the lambs, visiting the sick, or cleaning and cooking, should all be directly related to the Lord and should be a service to the Lord alone.</p><h2 class="head1">SERVING IN RESURRECTION</h2><p>In order to serve the Lord as a priest, we must not only be related directly and solely to the Lord, but we must also live in the principle of resurrection. We can see this from the history of the Israelites in the Old Testament. God's intention was for all the people of Israel to serve Him as priests and for them to become a kingdom of priests unto God (Exo. 19:6). But the Israelites failed and turned away from God, who led them out of Egypt, to worship the idols (Exo. 32). They committed fornication with heathen women and stirred up the wrath of the Lord (Num. 25). Only Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron, was zealous for the Lord, and the Lord gave him and his descendants a covenant of peace&mdash;the covenant of an everlasting priesthood (vv. 10-13). Among the Israelites, God set apart Aaron and his sons and made them a priesthood before Him; they took the place of the whole congregation of Israel to serve the Lord. However, Levi's sons, Korah, Dathan, and others, rose up to attack Moses and Aaron. They accused Moses and Aaron of lifting themselves above the congregation, and asked why they could not be priests as well. A moment of life and death followed; the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them alive. The dispute between the company of Korah and Aaron was not on minor points; it was on the matter of service to the Lord, on the priesthood (Num. 16:10). God punished them not because of their personal sin, but because of their service to the Lord (v. 18). This is indeed a very sobering matter.</p><p>Korah's and Dathan's company thought that they could be priests and could serve the Lord the same as Aaron. But God's Word shows us that a man is not a priest according to his natural condition or qualifications. Being a priest is a matter of resurrection. Numbers 17:1-8 shows us that Aaron was qualified to be a priest through his budding rod, which signifies death and resurrection. While a branch remains on the tree, it is living. Once it is cut off, it becomes dead. But Aaron's rod sprouted, budded, blossomed, and bore almonds. This is how God vindicated His choice of Aaron to be a priest to serve Him. This shows us that being a priest is something beyond the natural realm; it is something in the realm of resurrection.</p><p>In the New Testament, Hebrews 7 tells us that Christ became "a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec," and "the power of an indestructible life" (vv. 16-17). Christ was made a Priest by the taking of an oath; His office is established forever. His priesthood is also unalterable because He abides forever (vv. 20-24). Aaron's budding rod in the Old Testament was only a type of death and resurrection. The priests among the Israelites were prevented from continuing because of death, and their priesthood lasted for a short while only. Christ, however, became a priest through the power of the eternal life. The priests in the Old Testament were priests in position only. But Christ's priesthood is not only a position, but a reality. Today the New Testament believers become priests and serve the Lord according to the resurrection life.</p><p>What is death? Death is the removal through the cross of everything that is not of God. What is resurrection? Resurrection is anything that withstands death. Whatever enters death and then comes out of death is resurrection. In resurrection there is the new life. Many things cannot pass through death. But anything that comes out of death is new and on the ground of resurrection. All that we are and have must pass through death and resurrection. Our love and eloquence, like that of Moses, must pass through death and resurrection. May all that we have be brought through death and resurrection. This is the basic qualification of our service to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">AN INWARD SERVICE</h2><p>We also have to see that in order to serve the Lord, a priest must have an inward touch with God. The priests must learn the judgment of the breastplate inside the sanctuary before they can take care of the various affairs outside the sanctuary. No matter how busy Aaron was, he could not leave the sanctuary during his priestly service. This shows us that a priest has to lock himself up in God. If a priest is lacking in inward service, he cannot possibly have any outward service. We must serve God inwardly, fellowshipping with Him and drawing near to Him, before we can outwardly work for Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">A TALK WITH THOSE<br />WHO ARE ABOUT TO BE BAPTIZED</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded</h1><p>God's children are those who are joined to Christ. The result of God's salvation is to join men to Christ. If a man is not joined to Christ, salvation counts for nothing, and the Christian life means nothing. Redemption has its basis in Christ's union with man. The most important concept in the Bible is that of union. This union has nothing to do with understanding some doctrines; it has to do with the revelation of the reality of our union with Christ. If a Christian sees this, he will spontaneously become a living person. If he does not see this, he is dead and has no involvement with Christ in life.</p><h2 class="head1">IN ADAM</h2><p>The matter of union is revealed throughout the whole Bible. In Genesis Adam and Eve sinned. The Bible says that all have sinned through one man. It does not matter how we have conducted ourselves. When Adam sinned, all of his descendants sinned as well. The veil to the Holy of Holies was embroidered with four living creatures. These four living creatures signify the whole creation, while the veil signifies the body of Christ (Heb. 10:20). This tells us that the whole creation was joined to Christ. When His body was broken (Matt. 27:51; Heb. 10:20), the whole creation went through God's judgment. He accomplished redemption for the whole creation (Heb. 2:9). Leviticus tells us that the offerer had to lay his hand on the offering before it was offered up as a sacrifice. This was a sign of the union of the offering with the offerer. In Joshua 4 the Israelites took twelve stones from the river Jordan when they crossed over. We find reference to the matter of union everywhere in the Bible. Union is a very basic principle. In the New Testament, 1 Corinthians 15 speaks of the first man and the second man. The first man is Adam, and the second man is Christ. The second man is the last man; after Him, there is no third man. This is a fact in the eyes of God. In His eyes there are only two men&mdash;Adam and Christ. A person is either in Christ or in Adam.</p><p>Consider the insects. One little insect soon propagates itself into dozens of insects. They are identical to the one. If we do not kill the one little insect at the beginning, it will propagate itself into a big colony. Adam was the first "insect." Those who came after him are the descendants of Adam; they are the same as he. When a man is born, his parents give him a name, which is his given name. His family name never changes. His family name is the same as that of his ancestors. Everyone derives his heritage from his ancestors; everyone inherits his life from his ancestors. All the descendants of Adam have inherited the Adamic life of sin.</p><h2 class="head1">IN CHRIST</h2><p>Since every descendant of Adam has inherited his sinful life, what must God do to save man? He does not save us individually one by one. He does not deal with us as individuals. Rather, He has put us all into Christ. All He had to do was to deal with Christ. God caused Christ to bear our sins, die for us, and resurrect for us. In dealing with Christ, God dealt with us all. There is a pregnant sister from Changchow who once lived in Kulangsu. Later, her child was born in Changchow. Has the baby ever been to Kulangsu? Of course he has. He was in Kulangsu when he was in his mother's womb. Adam and Christ are both originators; we are in either one or the other. Before we were saved, we were in Adam. All of Adam's experiences were our experiences. After we are saved, we were put into Christ. All of Christ's accomplishments have become our experiences. This is the way God deals with us.</p><h2 class="head1">OF GOD WE ARE IN CHRIST</h2><p>Some may ask, "How can we be in Christ? He was crucified two thousand years ago. At that time I was not even born. How can I be in Christ and be crucified with Him?" We can consider the following illustration. When I was a child, my aunt once gave me a ten-dollar bill, and I put it into the pocket of my long gown. When I sent the gown to the cleaner, I forgot to take the money out. By the time I discovered it, the money was ruined from being washed. The one who washed the gown did not have any intention to wash my money, but it was washed when the gown was washed because it was inside the gown. Consider this hymnbook. Suppose I slip a piece of paper into this hymnbook and mail it to Nanking. Where will the piece of paper be? Is it possible for the book to go to Nanking and for the paper to remain here? No. Although I am sending the hymnbook to Nanking, the paper will arrive when the book arrives, because the paper is inside the book. If I throw the hymnbook into the river, the paper will be thrown into the river as well. If I snatch the book out of the water, the paper will be snatched out of the water also. The experience of the hymnbook will be the experience of the paper, because the paper is in the book. If I, Watchman Nee, can put a piece of paper into a book, is God not able to put all of us into Christ? This is something very easy for Him to do. He has put us all into Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). Hence, whatever God has done in Christ has been done in us. When Christ was judged by God, we were all judged as well. When Christ died, we died as well. All the experiences of Christ have become our experiences. This shows us that union is the underlying principle of redemption. Our redemption is based on our union with Christ. We receive all the benefits of salvation by being in Christ and joined to Him.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING THE FACT OF OUR UNION IN CHRIST</h2><p>Before you became a Christian, you felt unhappy and angry when others criticized you. But after you become a Christian, you begin to realize that you are not really that good. Many people try as hard as they can to escape from a sinful living, yet they discover that sin tenaciously holds on to them. How does God deal with this? What is His way of deliverance? His way is not for us to make improvements in ourselves. He has put us in Christ and crucified us in Christ. The way of our deliverance lies in our acknowledgment of what God has done in Christ. We are fully dealt with by being in Christ.</p><p>In Genesis God created six categories of creatures: fish, birds, insects, animals, beasts, and man. However, only four creatures represent the whole creation: the man, the lion, the ox, and the eagle. These four living creatures can be seen in the four faces of the cherubim. The cherubim signify the created life. The veil to the Holy of Holies was embroidered with the cherubim. When Christ died, the veil was split. This veil signifies the body of Christ. This means that when Christ died, the whole creation died together with Him. A believer's crucifixion with Christ is not something that he attains by himself. It is a matter of seeing and believing in what God has done. Once we see and believe, it becomes real to us. Unless we see and believe, no amount of mental or psychological exercise will help us. Through seeing our position in Christ and our union with Him, we are delivered from sin. Christ's experience has become our history. When He was dealt with, we were dealt with as well.</p><p>In 1927 I saw that I was dead with Christ. Before that time, I had prayed for six years for the Lord to show me the matter of my crucifixion with Him. One day the Holy Spirit's revelation came, and I saw that I was in Christ. When He died, I also died. I saw that my death was a thing of the past rather than a thing of the future. The death of Christ is a fact. My death is also a fact. When He died nineteen hundred years ago, God crucified me at the same time, because I was in Christ when He died. I was overjoyed by this revelation, and I ran downstairs from my room. Seeing a brother, I grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him. He was bewildered and asked what had happened to me. I said, "Brother, do you realize that I have died?" He asked, "What do you mean?" I said, "Do you not know that Christ has died? And do you not know that I have died with Him? Do you not know that when He died, I died?" This fact had become such a reality to me! From that time on, I never doubted my crucifixion with Christ. This revelation was the turning point of my Christian life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF BAPTISM</h2><p>Why does a Christian need to be baptized after he has believed in the Lord? Baptism is our confession that we have died with Christ. It speaks of two things. First, it signifies that we are related to Christ. The water of baptism symbolizes Christ. Being baptized means God has put us into Christ. When others are baptized, it is as if God is putting them into Christ. Second, it speaks of our crucifixion with Him. The water of baptism symbolizes the grave. Being baptized means that God has put us into the grave. When a person is  baptized, it is as if God is putting him into the grave. On the one hand, he becomes related to Christ; he is put into Christ and becomes a new man in Him. On the other hand, his old man has died; it is buried and terminated.</p><p>When Westerners drink tea, they like to add sugar to the tea. One day I was with a brother. As we were drinking tea, I put sugar into the tea and stirred it. After a few minutes I asked the brother, "Can you tell me where the sugar is now, and where is the tea?" He said, "No, you have mixed the two together, and they cannot be separated." We can say that the sugar has been "baptized" into the tea. The sugar is no longer merely inside the tea, with the sugar remaining as sugar and the tea remaining as tea. The sugar and the tea have become inseparable; the two have become one. God did not put us into Christ at the time we were baptized. No! Baptism is merely a reenactment of what happened two thousand years ago. Christ's crucifixion on the cross two thousand years ago is a fact. In the same way, our being in Christ and our crucifixion with Him are also facts. Our baptism is a reenactment of the fact which happened two thousand years ago. God has accomplished this fact, and it cannot be overturned. Baptism is our identification, our union, with Christ. Moreover, it is not performed merely in reference to something of the past, but to something of the present. We are crucified with Christ. Not only has our well-deserved punishment of sin been executed in Christ, but our very self has been dealt with as well. Baptism is our answer to God's accomplishment. We acknowledge that we have died and that we are crucified with Christ. In God's eyes when Christ died on the cross, we were crucified with Him as well. Our baptism is a testimony to this fact.</p><p>If you are not dead and someone buries you in the ground, you will surely struggle. You would not allow him to bury you. Burial is the consequence of death. Only dead men can be buried; those who are alive can never be buried. If you are not joined to Christ, you have no share in what Christ accomplished on the cross. You cannot be forgiven, justified, sanctified, or regenerated. But now that you are joined to Christ, His accomplishments become your experiences. Today you are being baptized. You have to see that God has put you into Christ, and He has dealt with Christ. When Christ went to the cross, He took the whole creation with Him. His death includes you and me. When you are baptized, you are testifying to the fact that you have died in the death of Christ. You have died with Christ, and therefore you are being buried in the water of baptism. "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life" (Rom. 6:3-4).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">TALKS</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: October 29, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded</h1><h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />BUFFETING OUR BODIES AND ASCETICISM</h2><p>Sister Ruth Lee asked: What is the difference between buffeting our bodies and asceticism? Paul said that he had learned to be content in whatever circumstances he was in. How did he deal with his body?</p><p>Answer: Asceticism is the denial of the proper needs of the body. Those who practice asceticism are not necessarily more spiritual than others. One brother refuses to use hot water to wash his face. He purposely clothes himself poorly. This is asceticism. Another sister once invited me to her house for a meal. She purposely cooked food that did not taste good. When I asked her why, she said, "I am ill-treating my body so that I can be spiritual. If I cooked the food too well, I would be indulging my flesh and would not be spiritual. I purposely ruin the food so that I will not indulge in fleshly enjoyment." It is true that a Christian should not crave ease and comfort and not covet nice food, but there is no need to purposely cook unpalatable food.</p><p>What then does it mean to buffet our bodies? Buffeting our bodies is to not allow the proper needs of our bodies to frustrate our spiritual life. This is true spirituality. Buffeting our bodies means that our bodies have proper needs, yet for the sake of the Lord and His work, we can forego the demand of such needs at critical times. If a Christian always demands that his needs be met, he has not learned the lesson of buffeting his body. Once I took hospitality with a brother in another person's house. During every meal he would stick his chopsticks into the dishes and turn the food over and over again in search of the choice meat. After that I declined to travel with him for the next ten years. Such a person has never learned the lesson of buffeting his own body; he has never learned to subject his body under him.</p><p>Practicing asceticism is denying the demand of the body when it has needs; it is purposely acting contrary to the law of the body. This is too much. However, if a person has never learned the lesson of buffeting his body, he is useless in the Lord's hand. Once I traveled with two brothers to another place. Both brothers were very active in preaching the gospel and were zealous in helping others. But at a certain point, both would suddenly lose their stamina; it would be impossible to drag them any further. They had to take a nap every day after lunch. Even when someone was waiting to fellowship with them or other matters were waiting to be settled, they would turn the other way. I could beg them, but no word or amount of nudging could move them an inch. This is setting the mind on the flesh, indulging in self-pity and self-love. Those who act this way have never learned the lesson of buffeting their bodies.</p><p>Chinese Taoism and Buddhism are filled with ascetic philosophies, but asceticism is not a biblical concept. Paul said that he made his body his slave (1 Cor. 9:26-27). This means that he directed his body to serve him. He was not bound by his body; instead, his body served him. Making our body our slave means that we do not allow our spiritual life to be hampered by the needs of our body. Those who insist that they have to use hot water to wash their face have never learned the lesson of buffeting their bodies or making their bodies their slaves. Of course, we should not abuse the biological law of the body; we should take care of its needs. But our bodies should be always under the control of our spirits. Some people insist on satisfying their appetite; they cannot suffer a little hunger. Some people insist on having adequate sleep; they cannot miss any sleep. Some people love cleanliness; they cannot stand any mess. Some people insist on sleeping on soft beds; they cannot stand hard beds. These are examples of not making our bodies our slaves. All those who feel that their spirits are willing but that their bodies are weak have not learned the lesson of buffeting their bodies. A person who indulges in such self-love is useless in the hand of the Lord. May the Lord be merciful to us, and may we learn the lesson of buffeting our bodies and making them our slaves.</p><h2 class="head1">ON MIRACLES</h2><p>Faith should be a very spontaneous thing in a believer. One should not need to exercise any effort to believe. If a man has to strive and struggle to believe, his faith is not genuine. One brother testified that when he was a young believer, he had to exert considerable effort to believe. The first time he preached the gospel to others, he spent much time to pray. It seemed as if he had to collect a great deal of "faith" from somewhere and stuff himself with this "faith." God was merciful to him and answered his prayer in many matters. But to an outsider, his struggle appeared very painful, and his "faith" was very unnatural.</p><p>Today believers should pray to God in a very ordinary way, and God answers their prayers in a very ordinary way. Indeed, this is what a miracle is all about. Every miracle worker should not be conscious of his miracles. A man who feels that performing a miracle is a strange thing is one who is far away from God. Those who dwell in God's house do not consider miracles a strange thing. But those who dwell in their tents consider miracles to be a strange thing. Moses performed many miracles, but he did not feel anything strange. When he led the Israelites through the Red Sea, the sea parted in front of him. Moses did not think that he was performing a miracle, he just did it. The Israelites believed without fanfare, and it just happened. Faith and miracles are something spontaneous for those who know God.</p><p>In America some Christians say that all believers should practice Mark 16:17-18: "And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will pick up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well." They purposely put cobras in front of believers and allow the snakes to bite them. Those who are bitten eventually die. Those who practiced such things have a wrong motive. They consider miracles to be a kind of performance and use them to show off their power.</p><p>Miracles are nothing extraordinary. When Paul was bitten by the serpent once, he simply cast it into the fire (Acts 28:3-5). To him, it was as common as a mosquito bite. He did not say to the natives of Malta, "Come, and I will show you a great miracle." He did not promote anything. A man who genuinely knows God does not promote miracles. However, a man who does not promote miracles does not necessarily know God. But we can say with certainty that those who know God do not promote miracles. If we try to put God's promises to the test by claiming Mark 16:17-18, it will be a very strange thing if God gives us any experience at all. Even if we say that we have had the experiences of Mark 16:17-18, there will still be doubt that our faith is genuine.</p><p>God performs miracles when there is the need for it. Man cannot call forth miracles by his own making. Miracles are done unconsciously. Anything done in a conscious way is not a miracle. The result of faith is unnoticeable. You may not know if you have faith, but things happen spontaneously. Genuine miracles are acts that one performs unconsciously. Peter's shadow healed the sick (Acts 5:15), but he did not notice it. He probably did not realize that his shadow was healing others. If others hit me, I can feel it. But if they hit my shadow, I cannot feel it. This was the case with Peter.</p><p>Once George Muller prayed in a ship for the fog to go away. I myself also prayed in Plum Village for rain. But these miracles never repeat themselves. Neither of these miracles were performances; they were not done to demonstrate one's power. They merely gave men a glimpse of God's greatness, power, and authority.</p><p>We often use a verse to test God or wrestle with Him. Romans 7:18 says, "For to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not." Perhaps we can also say, "For to will is present with me, but to work out the miracle is not."</p><p>Genuine miracles are a mystery even to those who perform them. When we commit ourselves to God's hand, things happen. God can perform miracles through us, but He will not allow us to be conscious of them. Someone once asked George Muller if he had the gift of faith. He answered that he had the grace of faith rather than the gift of faith. God's power is great; He can do everything by Himself. He does not need us to help Him. Faith is spontaneous for those who genuinely trust in God. There is no effort involved. They live in a simple way and recognize that God is doing everything rather than themselves.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN PATHWAY</h2><p>We may think that God has given us many different ways. Actually those who have many ways do not know God. A man who really knows God does not have many ways. When God reveals Himself to man, He shuts off man's many ways and leaves him only one way. Proverbs 4:18 says, "The path of the just is as the shining light." The word "path" is singular. This means that there is only one path for the just. God often reveals only one path, and we do not even have the option to ask for another path. The New Testament shows us that Christ had only one way; there were never two ways for Him to choose. He only had one way to go. Why do so many people feel that there are many ways? They think there are many ways, and they feel that they have to find out which way is correct. From among many different ways, they try to find the one that God has prepared for them. Actually, the spiritual pathway is never hard to find. All one needs is a desire to do God's will and walk on His path. God will spontaneously put His way before him.</p><p>Today many brothers and sisters have many ways. They receive invitations here and there. They are putting many ways before them. It seems that God is putting much confidence in them by presenting many ways and allowing them to make their own choice. Actually, these ones may not be spiritual at all. There are also some who are waiting for the Lord to open up more ways for them. They have seven or eight ways before them already, yet they are still waiting for God to open up more ways. These ones should actually ask God to close up ways so that they can get on God's unique way.</p><p>In their initial stage of following the Lord, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had many choices. But in their old age, they only had one way&mdash;the God-ordained way. The responsibility for finding the way does not rest on us, but on God. We do not have to frantically seek for the way. All we need to do is to resolve to do His will. God Himself will show us His unique, ordained way. We also have to realize that we do not have the ability to run the race well, just as we did not choose the right way by ourselves. God has closed us in, like He closed Noah within the ark. Only God's protection keeps us in His way.</p><p>There was only one pathway throughout Paul's life. He never hesitated on his pathway. From the time he met the Lord on the way to Damascus, he had only one way before him. He strove to run this race. In the end he could say, "I have finished the course" (2 Tim. 4:7). The more a Christian grows spiritually, the fewer ways he has. At a certain point, he will only have one way&mdash;the way God has ordained for him. May the Lord close up the many ways that are before us and keep us on His unique, ordained way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE INITIAL MANIFESTATIONS<br />OF THE SONS OF GOD</h1><h2 class="head4">(The Record of a Talk with Newly Baptized Believers)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: November 1, 1940<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:6; 3:14; 5:9, 11-13; John 5:24; 17:23; Rom. 8:15; 1 Pet. 2:22</h1><h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>When a person is born or even after he is one or two years old, he does not know who he is and what his name is. But the amazing thing is that when he grows up, he spontaneously knows his name, who his parents are, and where he lives. It will be a big problem if he does not know who he is or if he becomes lost in the streets and cannot tell others who his father is, where he lives, and what his name is. When a person gets to a certain age, he knows who he is, where he came from, and who his ancestors are. In the Old Testament a man could not be recognized as a Jew unless he could name his genealogy. In the New Testament Matthew 1 begins with the origin of Christ. It is very important for God's people to know their origin. If a man does not know who he is, he will get in trouble when he is lost. It is also extremely important for a regenerated Christian to know his spiritual birth and where he came from. Every brother and sister should know that he or she is born of God. He has regenerated us with the word of truth through the resurrection of Christ. We do have our genealogy in the Lord.</p><p>In order to be a man, you have to know who you are and what your status is. For example, if the police suspect you of sedition, you must be able to prove your identity if they want to interrogate you. Simply telling them who you are will not be enough. If they do not believe that you are telling the truth, you can show them a business card. But even this can be questioned because you may not be the person on the card. Similarly, if others do not believe that you are a son of God, what can you do? Can you prove that you are a son of God? Can you prove that you are indeed born of God? In order to answer these questions, we need to know four points from the Epistle of 1 John. Actually, there are more than four points, but for convenience's sake and for our present purpose, we will only mention four.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INITIAL MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SONS OF GOD</h2><h2 class="head2">Knowing God</h2><p>First John 1:6 says: "If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth." This verse tells us that we should know God. In the Bible, when light and darkness are used as illustrations, light refers to positive things and darkness refers to negative things. The darkness in 1 John does not refer to conduct that is dark, but to places of darkness. It does not refer to things that are done in darkness, but to the environment of darkness itself. When a man is in darkness, he lacks the light of the gospel. For example, if the light is turned off in this room, we will be sitting in darkness. We will not see each others' faces, and we will not know what is happening in this room. In the same way, when we say that a man is in darkness, we mean that he is ignorant of spiritual things. It does not mean necessarily that he is committing evil or doing bad things. Rather, it means that he is ignorant of God.</p><p>First John 1:5 and 7 show us that God is light and that He dwells in light. When we walk in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin. Yet Psalm 18:11 says, "He made darkness His hiding place." In the Old Testament God dwelt in darkness, that is, in the Holy of Holies. He was a mysterious God, not a God who was known and understood by man. For example, when we switch the light off in this room, we can only guess who is in the room. In the Old Testament men could only guess about God; they could not know Him in a clear way. God was in darkness, and there was no way to tell whether He had forgiven our sins or whether He loved us. This is the Old Testament. In the New Testament we can know these things, because the veil of the Holy of Holies has been split and the light has shone. If light is outside our room, and the door is open, it is impossible for light not to come in. God has revealed Himself. He has revealed Himself from the Holy of Holies. He is no longer hidden.</p><p>Before I was saved, I often wondered what God was like. Year after year I guessed what God was like. Although I did not believe in Him, I did pray: "O heaven! It would have been better had I not been born. You have begotten me, and now I have all kinds of questions. There is God, and there is also myself. But You cause me to have many inconvenient ques- tions." This happened before I believed. I was not at all clear about God. A Western friend once asked me the difference between the Old and New Testaments. I told him that in the Old Testament God was hidden, whereas in the New Testament God has revealed Himself in Christ. On Mount Sinai God was hidden, but the God in the Gospels is a touchable and knowable God.</p><p>A saved person must know God and be able to tell others about God. If you know me, and others ask about me, you cannot say merely that I have eyes and a mouth. Others have eyes and mouths as well. You have to tell them in detail about me. The same is true about our knowledge of God. We cannot say that we do not know anything about God. If we have the life of God, we should have the ability to know Him. We must dwell in the light and walk in the light. Only then will the blood of Jesus cleanse us from every sin, and only then will we know God. We must have revelation. Revelation is crucial to a Christian; it enables him to know God. This is the blessing brought to us by the gospel, and this is the initial function, manifestation, and evidence of a regenerated Christian.</p><h2 class="head2">Loving the Brothers</h2><p>God is light. When we dwell in the light, we have no problem with God whatsoever. But 1 John 3:14 says that we know we have passed from death to life because we love the brothers. It is a difficult thing for men with different backgrounds, social statuses, races, and philosophies to come together. But Christians can do this, because we are not only "comrades" with common interests or men given to a common cause; we are those who love the brothers and sisters and who can love one another from our heart. Many people can help their comrades, but they cannot love them. But a saved person who has God's life and God's love within can love others.</p><p>Being saved means to receive the life of God. This is something inward. All those who are begotten of God surely love God, and they surely love one another. As soon as you know that a certain person is a brother, you will love him. When you travel in a train or ship, there may be unbelievers all around you. But as soon as you see someone reading a Bible, you will love him no matter what denomination or sect he belongs to. Your heart will jump for joy. This love for the brothers is in the divine life which we received at the time of regeneration. This love is the expression as well as the proof of our salvation and regeneration.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Continuing in Sin</h2><p>A saved person will not continue in sin. If you do not continue in sin, it proves that you are a saved person. This is something that can be tested. First John 2:29 says, "Everyone who practices righteousness also has been begotten of Him." This refers to our deliverance from sin. Those who are begotten of God practice righteousness. The life within demands that they practice righteousness. This is the characteristic of the life of God. Under ordinary circumstances a piece of wood will not sink in water. However, under special circumstances it will sink. If you put a ton of stones on the wood, it will sink. If the wood could speak, it would voice its objection every second. It would say that it should be afloat, but that the stones have weighed it down. But even if the wood is submerged under water, it will not become "submerged wood." When the circumstances change and the pressure is gone, the wood will come back up again. It may sink temporarily, but wood itself does not sink. This cannot be said of rocks, which automatically sink. Even if a saved brother or sister has sinned, I can still say that he is one who does not sin, because the life within him does not sin. If he sins, a power or nature within him will make him feel sorry about it. This is something that an unbeliever can never experience.</p><p>A sister once testified that prior to being a Christian, she did not blush when she lied. She was a "professional" liar. But she changed after becoming a Christian. When she lied, her heart would beat fast and her face would turn red. Inwardly she would condemn the lies as sins. There is something within her that forbids her to lie. An unbeliever must exercise a conscious effort to not lie. But for a Christian to not lie is something innate; it is the inward power that makes him not to lie. Lying matches the inward nature of those in the world, but it is something that goes against the Christian nature. This nature has to do with the life that begat you. It is difficult for you to quit gambling and smoking merely on the ground that you are a Christian. But these are very natural things when you have the power of God's life within you. A Christian does not grit his teeth to refrain from sinning. There is a power within him which keeps him from sinning. There is a sinless nature within him. If you sin, this nature objects and makes you feel uneasy. This is Christ's salvation. It is not a matter of resisting sin by your own strength. You have received a life that does not sin. Being delivered from sin is the third manifestation of our salvation and regeneration.</p><h2 class="head2">Having God's Testimony in One's Heart</h2><p>First John 5:10 tells us that God's testimony is within us; we have the life of God. Not only does the Bible say this, even our heart testifies to this fact. This has nothing to do with one's outward behavior; it is an inward thing. We are God's children; not only does the Holy Spirit testify of this within us, even our own spirit testifies of the same. There is a difference in feeling between Brother Chen Ke-san calling his mother-in-law "mother," and his wife calling her "mother." Brother Chen's calling is related to his circumstance; he does so because of his wife. His wife has "the spirit of sonship," but he does not. Today we spontaneously and sweetly call God our Father. We have the Spirit of God's Son within us, and His testimony is in us. Many people call God the Father in a vain way in their prayer; they have merely learned of this term from others. This is the prayer of a nominal Christian. All those who are genuinely saved can cry "Abba Father" from the bottom of their heart.</p><p>First John 5:13 says, "I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God." Many people jump to this verse too quickly. They skip verse 11. Verse 11 speaks of the testimony of God. When a man has the testimony of God in his heart, he will spontaneously know that he has eternal life. Some read John 3:16, which says, "Every one who believes into Him...would have eternal life." As they are reading it, they think they have eternal life. But when they go to bed and consider some more, they doubt whether they have it. It seems as if the life they received is not eternal. We must have the testimony in our heart before we can know that we have eternal life. First, there is the Son of God, and then there is life. Salvation and regeneration are not something outward. They have nothing to do with knowledge. Salvation is to have God's Son and God's life in a real way. It is God's testimony in us that convinces us of our birth in God.</p><p>As soon as we are saved, we can know God and love the brothers and sisters in the Lord. We will not continue in sin, and we have God's testimony in our heart, proving to us that we are of God. These are the manifestations and evidences of our regeneration and salvation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">THE LAW OF LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: November 2, 1940<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: Rom. 7:18&mdash;8:2</h1><h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF LIFE OR THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>After a person is saved, he can have two different kinds of realizations about the new life he has received. He may regard this life as a power or as a law. There is a world of difference between these two kinds of realizations. Is the life that God has given us a power or a law? If a man does not have the proper realization of this subject, he may still live in sin and not be able to overcome. Before we became a Christian, we had no thought of doing good. But after we became a Christian, we began to strive to be good and practice good behavior. Disappointingly, however, we found ourselves powerless to do any good. Many people say, "Now that I am saved, I have the power to do good. Before I believed in the Lord, I did not have the power to do good. But now I can do good." But these ones frequently find themselves in Paul's condition in Romans 7: "For to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not" (v. 18). Every saved person has the life of the Lord in him, but when he tries to live according to the power of this life, he always fails. He becomes very bothered and even discouraged, thinking that God's life can do nothing more for him. But this kind of experience is abnormal and unnecessary.</p><p>We have to know that the life that God has given us is indeed powerful. But the life that has been given to us is not primarily for power. There is power in God's life, but this life has not been given to us primarily to be our power. Romans 8 shows us that God's life is given to us to be our law. It is one thing for life to be in us as a power, and it is another thing for life to be in us as a new law. There is a great difference between the two. If we only know God's life as a power without knowing it as a law, we will miss the greatest of all blessings. Paul's experience in Romans 7 was the experience of a saved person. He said that to will was present with him, but to work out the good was not. Many people who try to live by the power of life end in failure. The law of life is far superior to the power of life. God's life within us operates in the way of a law; it is not merely for the purpose of giving us some power. Once we realize that life operates within us as a law, it will be very easy for us to be free from sin, and it will be very easy for us to do God's will and please Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>What is a law? A law is something that acts a certain way by itself. For example, my keys fall to the floor because there is the law of gravity. The law of gravity pulls the keys downward to the floor. The force of gravity operates irrespective of time and space. If I drop my keys here, they fall down. If I drop my keys in Tientsin, they fall down there as well. If I drop my keys in New York, they still fall down there. If I drop them today, they fall down. If I drop them tomorrow, they will still fall down. This is a law. The force of gravity is a natural law. It acts the same way all the time. The action of the law is something spontaneous; there is no need of human aid or motivation. I have been preaching and praying for twenty years. I never need to preach to the law of gravity or pray to it. If you let go of your keys, you do not have to worry whether or not they will fall down. Falling is a law. A law does not require any preaching, praying, human resolutions, or wishes; it is spontaneous.</p><p>Today many Christians make up their mind to do good. They take life as a power, and they want God's life to give them the power to do good. Whenever they think of God's life, they think of power. If they cannot do good, they think that they have not trusted enough in the power of God's life. This is a wrong concept, and it must be corrected. A Christian does not perform good by making resolutions. His doing good is the result of the operation of the inner law of life. Making up one's mind to not lie, to not lose one's temper, or to not get angry is not what the Christian faith is all about. This is not the grace of the New Testament. Anything we do by exercising the will is not part of our faith. Our faith consists of God's life operating within us through a law. This operation results in our being able to live out the Christian life.</p><p>Today's scientific inventions are simply the result of discovering the laws that exist in the universe and then applying these laws. This is what Christians should do today; they should discover the spiritual laws and apply these laws. Christians should not look for God's commandments in the Bible and try to carry these out by their will, nor even attempt to carry them out by the power of God's life. A Christian should discover the law of God's life and live by this law of life. This is the Christian life. Before I discovered this law of life, I often wondered why I sinned so easily and why it was so difficult to do good. I did not have to exert any strength to lose my temper, and I found it very difficult not to lose my temper. We only resolve to do good; we never resolve to do evil. But working out evil is easy, yet working out good is not. God's life is in us, yet the law of sin is also in us. The problem is that the law of sin is obvious, while the law of life is not obvious. I did not understand this. Later, I found out that our many resolutions were in the principle of Romans 7, and the result was nothing but failure. We failed because we did not know God's life enough. We only knew that there is power in this life; we did not realize that this life is a law. Once we realize that this life is a law, we will have patience as easily as we had temper. We will have humility as easily as we had pride. We will have love as easily as we had hatred. There is a new law within us&mdash;the law of the life of God. This law is very powerful. It is stronger than the law of sin; therefore, it can overcome the law of sin. Brothers and sisters, do you have such an experience? This should be our normal, daily experience.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT TRUSTING IN THE WILL</h2><p>If we can sin effortlessly through the law of sin, we can surely live righteously through the law of life. Yet in actual experience, many Christians do not believe that God is in us as a law. If I let go of my keys and at the same time try my best to push them downward, this means that I do not believe in the force of gravity. This is the way many people live their Christian life. They strive with the sweat of their whole body to do good. They struggle strenuously and forcefully to be a Christian, but they still fail. It is a hard thing to try to muster one's will to act spiritual. It is also a hard task to act serious out of fear of becoming unspiritual. Such performances are not the conduct of a genuine Christian. When I was in London, I asked Brother Sparks about a certain person. He told me that this person was too serious. He meant that he was propping himself up with his will; he was trying to maintain a spiritual fa&#231;ade. Once the fa&#231;ade falls, however, everything falls apart.</p><p>If anyone tries to solve his problem by the will and thinks that he can deal with his problems as long as he has a strong will, he will experience what Paul experienced in Romans 7:24: "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" All those who strive with their will find that they cannot make it. They cannot satisfy God's demand. Asking them to be totally obedient to God's will is like asking a fish to fly in the air or a bird to swim in the water. The fish and the bird have their own lives, and the laws of the two lives act differently. Swimming in the water is a law for fish, and flying in the air is a law for birds. If a fish tries to fly by its will or a bird tries to swim by its will, they will both be dead in five minutes. Man's will can only be made subject to the law of life; it can never be put above the law of life. Man can only satisfy God's demand by living according to the law of God's life; he cannot accomplish this by the power of his own will.</p><h2 class="head1">TRUSTING IN THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>Paul preached life, and he also preached the law of life. God has not only given us life, He has given us the law of life. Believers should not only trust in life, but in the law of life. Being a Christian is not a strenuous exercise. There is no need to strive, to make up our mind, or to pretend to do good. All we have to do is let go and allow the law of the inner life to operate within us. We have to be clear that the life a Christian receives is a law. This law is not under the control of our will. On the contrary, the minute we stop exercising our will, this law will operate and do good in a spontaneous way. May the Lord open our eyes to see that the life we received is a law, and may we see the futility of man's will. May the Lord forbid us from doing His will by our own will, and may we trust in the law of His life, allowing this law to operate in us in a spontaneous way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">TALKS</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Afternoon, November 3, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded</h1><h2 class="head1">THE PRODUCING OF THE MAN-CHILD</h2><p>The greatest work of God is the rapture of the man-child. Once the man-child is raptured to His throne, there will be war in heaven, and Satan will be cast onto the earth (Rev. 12:5-9). If any Christian today wants to participate in this rapture, he has to be watchful and ready for the rapture by the Lord. If he does, he will have a share in this greatest work of God.</p><p>The woman in Revelation 12 represents the Body of Christ. In God's plan the Body spans from eternity to eternity. It includes all the saints between the two eternities. The man-child in God's eternal plan, however, only refers to the overcomers in this period.</p><p>The giving of birth to the man-child refers to some who have left the denominations. Of course, not everyone who has left the denominations is part of the man-child. Only those who have left the denominations and who have seen this great work of God and have a part in it are the man-child. The man-child is the body within the Body. The woman is the outward, visible, and larger Body, while the man-child that has been conceived within is something hidden, something that ordinary eyes cannot see.</p><p>There is a definite number to those who are raptured. The man-child was born to reign. This is very interesting! When the Lord Jesus was born, He was "born King" (Matt. 2:2). Christ's birth in Bethlehem was a begetting that has to do with man, whereas His resurrection from the dead was a begetting that has to do with God. This is why God said, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You" (Acts 13:33).</p><p>I have been on an airplane six times, and I often heard the pilots asking each other, "How high is the ceiling?" This means how high are the clouds. There is the sky above the clouds and the sky under the clouds. When the pilots said that the plane was "above the ceiling" or "below the ceiling," they meant that the plane was above the clouds or below the clouds. Today some Christians are flying "above the ceiling," while others are flying "below the ceiling." There are some spiritual things which I have seen that you may not have seen. Or you may have seen some spiritual things that a third person has not seen or known. The "ceiling" of some Christians today is almost as low as the floor. God is after spiritual giants today. These "giants" are the man-child. God desires to gain some who will be a part of the man-child. May more people be raised up to become the man-child today.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING</h2><p>The sanctification of the anointing cannot be separated from the teaching of the anointing. As soon as we have the sanctification of the anointing, we have the teaching of the anointing. Those who are lacking in the teaching of the anointing are surely lacking in the sanctification of the anointing.</p><p>For a period of time Brother Austin-Sparks was conducting special conferences every month on Saturdays and Mondays. One brother asked, "If this kind of conference goes on month after month, will your speaking not be exhausted?" Brother Sparks answered, "If a man has the genuine experience of the cross and he knows the cross, he will not need to worry about running out of sermons. He will only need to worry about running out of time."</p><p>The anointing within will tell us what we should do and should not do; it will tell us if something is right or wrong. If something is according to the leading of the Holy Spirit, it cannot be ambiguous. The face of the mother, whether she is smiling or frowning, is the indication for her children to know right and wrong.</p><p>I believe that the Holy Spirit has been poured out, and that the Holy Spirit is in the believers. The coming of the Spirit leads us to believe in Christ and to know that we are saved. The indwelling of the Spirit causes the believers to know all things. If a believer has a problem with the anointing, it is because he has a problem with the "Holiness to Jehovah" (Zech. 14:20).</p><p>The anointing is not only an individual matter, but a corporate matter as well. Every member in the church needs to maintain the proper standing. The word Christian means those who are anointed. Christians are little anointed ones, those who are sanctified by the anointing. This is our position. At the same time, we have to walk according to the teaching of the anointing. Today many people are anointed, yet they do not behave like anointed ones. This is like Saul, who was anointed but who continued to sin and was disciplined by the Lord.</p><p>The teaching of the anointing is higher than the condemnation or leading of the conscience. The conscience will either give us a sense of peace or a sense of unrest. This sensation is based on the concept of right and wrong. However, when God's light comes, the inner peace that follows has nothing to do with the sense of rest or unrest in the conscience. The conscience may condemn, while the peace within persists. A brother did something, and his conscience condemned him. He felt sad and wrote a letter to a mature brother, relating the incident to him. After the mature one read the letter, he wrote back and brought light to the first one, who then regained his peace. The conscience can be wrong, but the teaching of the anointing can never be wrong. Every person's conscience has its own standard. We can call this the local conscience. For example, what kind of coat should a person wear? Should he buy vegetables from the market and cook them at home? Can he take some wine? In these minor matters the feeling of the conscience is derived from our own understanding of right and wrong.</p><p>The conscience can be wrong, but the sanctification of the anointing and the teaching of the anointing can never be wrong. The garden of Eden can better be known as the age of ignorance rather than the age without sin. In that age there was no sanctification of the anointing or teaching of the anointing. There was only the conscience to enable man to differentiate between right and wrong.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">TALKS</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Afternoon, November 5, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded</h1><h2 class="head1">MAN BEING THE ISSUE</h2><p>God created man from the dust of the earth as a vessel to contain Him. This means that His life must shine out of man like a light. The appearance of a lamp is not crucial, but it is crucial for light to shine out from it. Some love to speak, while others do not. But whether one is talkative or quiet, he has to afford the light the chance to shine out. As soon as some people speak in the meeting, others say, "There he goes again!" That one's speaking is not the shining of the light. Some people pretend to be spiritual. They may appear very nice outwardly, but a person's daily walk is something that cannot be faked.</p><p>In order to have the shedding of the blood, there must first be wounds. Hebrews 9:22 speaks of the "shedding of blood." It was not only the blood, but the shedding of the blood. When Christ was living on earth, His body had blood. When He was crucified and pierced on the cross, His blood was shed. By shedding His blood, the Lord was able to forgive man's sin and supply man with life. Many people are nice and have earned praises. Others look at them and consider them to be wonderful, but the cross has not inflicted any wound on them. They have not shed any blood and therefore have nothing to give to others. The cross brings in dealings and wounds. Such wounds become outlets for the supply to flow to others. God inflicts us with the cross because He wants to break us, increase our measure, and expand the capacity of our spirit to match His life.</p><p>In 1927 I was introduced by Miss Shi to a cardiologist. He took an x-ray of me and said that there were problems with my heart and lungs. My heart was abnormal; it was too small. He said that it would be all right if my heart was in a smaller body, but that it was too small for a person as tall as me. The heart of a normal person must match the size of his body. The same is true with our spirit. God wants our spirit to be large enough to match His work in us. God is not afraid of our wisdom or ability; He is much greater than we are. He wants to see a spirit that is large enough to match our ability, wisdom, and personality. Some people accomplish something and say, "I have done this!" But a different person may say, "The Lord has done this!" When some people speak, it is themselves who are speaking. When others speak, it is God who is speaking within them. Still others speak very little and spend half of their time sleeping. No matter what condition a person is in, his spirit will not be the same after he has been dealt with by the Lord, even though his actions and words may still be the same.</p><p>We often say that we have to deal with our natural life. But what should be the extent of the cross's dealing? The cross must operate to the point that our spirit is released. Let me tell you a little story about Brother T. Austin-Sparks. He is not a skillful host at all. If you ask him to be a host, you have found the wrong person. He does not speak much, and if you sit down with him for half an hour or even an hour and a half, you may only hear the ticking of the clock on the wall. Although you cannot hear anything from his mouth, you can sense his spirit and feel the presence of the Lord. The cross is an open wound. When your blood flows out of the wound, others will touch your spirit and touch God's life through you. God deals with men, but the dealings do not make them abnormal; the dealings merely enable God's life to flow out. If you have the opportunity to get close to Brother Austin-Sparks, you will sense immediately that he is a person with a big spirit.</p><p>Some people preach in an ordinary way. You know that you can say the same thing. But when they utter these seemingly ordinary words, others touch their spirit. Some people stand up to pray, and all the brothers and sisters can say amen. Their prayers touch the inner being of others, who can sense that a strong spirit is present in these ones. However, when other people stand up to pray, at the same time others pray for the Lord to shorten those prayers. One brother sat through a sermon and afterwards reported to others, saying, "The teaching today was good. The doctrine was absolutely right." But doctrines can only convey knowledge to others; they cannot supply others with the spirit. Right doctrines or good expositions cannot touch people. Their spirit must be touched by the Lord Himself. Those who take the way of the cross do not need to think too much. Just because we have thought something through does not mean that we truly have worked it out. The problems of many people are problems of the mind; they are not spiritual problems. Even if we can solve all the problems in our mind, we may still not be able to grow spiritually. There is no need to deal with these kinds of problems. All we have to do is to stop our thoughts, jump over this spiritual hurdle, and we will grow spiritually. Those who have a problem with their mind mostly do not have any reality in life. We should remove all considerations of creed, knowledge, and intellect.</p><p>God created everything in six days, and then He rested. It should only take God a very short time to deal with man. If it takes a long time, the procrastination is on our side. Of course, God has His timing in dealing with men. But I must say that when God deals with man, it is primarily man who delays God's time and his own time. We have to drop all theological debates and accept God's dealing in a simple way.</p><h2 class="head1">IS THE OPINION OF THE MANY THE WILL OF GOD?</h2><p>Once Brother Luan was working in a certain place in Southeast Asia. He felt within that he should leave, and he even had a dream that he should leave. But the local brothers begged him to tarry. He had planned to leave at 6:00 p.m., but he eventually changed his mind and agreed to leave at 9:00 p.m. But when he was about to leave, the government sent men to him and he could no longer leave. The result was quite bad. Should he have obeyed the brothers and not been independent? Or should he have gone along with the leading within? My answer is that the Bible only tells us to submit to the Body; it never tells us to submit to a corpse or to the temperament of certain people. The "hooliganism" in Southeastern Asian countries cannot be a fair representation of God's authority. Many people consider Christian meetings as a kind of entertainment or a diversion from their daily humdrum. If I were Brother Luan, I would have asked, "Did you pray about your request? If this is something from yourself, please drop it." Only after you have questioned in this way is there any reason to consider staying. Many people are looking for nothing but spiritual excitement.</p><p>I am not afraid that my words will spread to Southeast Asia. Once I was invited to visit the brothers in Southeast Asia. They told me that they had problems and that they needed help. When I arrived, I told them that I had nothing to say. The brothers then said, "We would like you to share a word about `nothing.'" At the beginning of the meeting, almost everyone was an usher. They brought many unbelievers and worldly ones into the meeting. At the end of the meeting, I asked the brothers and sisters, "Are you trying to receive help in this conference for yourselves or are you trying to help others?" It is wrong for us to follow the flesh, be it one man's flesh or the majority's flesh.</p><p>The name Laodicea means "the opinion of the people." Believers should not follow the majority, because the majority may not be right. A worker's itinerary should not be dictated by others or by himself. He has to pray before the Lord, and the Lord has to decide for him. God rewards the simple believers. It is the most terrible thing for one to be ignorant of God's will and to lead others into ignorant things at the same time. Brother Luan had fallen into the hands of robbers.</p><h2 class="head1">PROPER GUIDANCE</h2><p>Sister Lee asked: Some time ago someone cabled and extended an invitation to me. I did not know if I should go.</p><p>Answer: Consider the question of paying the tax in Matthew 17. This was not something that one should or should not do. In doing anything we should ask if we are doing it in the light or in darkness. If something is of the Lord, we will surely sense that we are in the light when we do it. But if we feel that something is wrong, we should stop immediately, because if something is questionable, it is in darkness. Sometimes we go along with the brothers, not because we are clear about God's will, but because we do not know what to do. Even if we go along with our brothers, we should first find out how a thing should be done before we go along with them.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</h2><p>The sheet that Peter saw was not the church (Acts 10:9-16). Only the "tent" that Paul spoke of was the church. Galatians 3:28 says, "There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus." This means that there is neither Greek nor Jew. In Christ there are only those who are Christ's. All those who are Christ's are the sons of God. Hence, in the church there are no Greeks or Jews, slaves or free men. In the church there are no individual "men"; there is only Christ. Galatians 3:26-27 says, "For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ."</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF THE CROSS IN MAN</h2><p>Before the cross operates in man, his zeal can become ambition, his prayer can become accusations, his love for the brothers can become factious, and the power of the Spirit can be turned into an opportunity for the flesh. The key to the issue lies in this: Does the cross come before the work or does the work come before the cross? Whether or not a man is proper before God depends on the amount of work that the cross has accomplished in him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">WORLD WARS AND THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: November 9, 1940<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: Matt. 24:4-14; Acts 4:25; Heb. 11:5-6</h1><p>Many people pay attention to the signs of the end times. Some say that the answer lies in Matthew 24:4-14. It is true that the Lord spoke of the end of this age in this portion of the Word. As a consequence, the focus of many people is on peoples fighting against peoples and nations against nations. But we have to see that no matter what the outcome of these wars and no matter how peoples fight against peoples and nations against nations, there is only one result&mdash;the suffering and loss of God's children. In any war there are two sides. Spiritually speaking, there are also two sides. On one side, there are the Christians, that is, the church, and on the other side, there are the opposing nations. They join together to inflict hardship on God's church. The issue is not which nation wins; the focus is the people of God. In the war between Japan and China, the suffering party is neither China nor Japan, but the people of God. In the war between Germany and England, the suffering party is not Germany or England, but the people of God. This is why the Lord said in Matthew 24:9, "Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of My name." Man looks at the victory or defeat of the nations. But from God's view, it is His people who are suffering, no matter which nation wins or loses.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF WORLD WARS</h2><p>Today the world is a mess. Peoples are fighting against peoples and nations against nations. We can see war and famine everywhere. These are the works of Satan. In the eyes of the world, nations fight against one another because of antagonism. But in the eyes of God, they are all banded together. Before the European War [World War I], an English brother wrote, "Once the war starts, I do not know how many Christians will be left behind." A Christian cannot take the same view as others at the time of war.</p><p>We have to see the manipulations of Satan behind all wars. Strictly speaking, when one nation fights against an- other nation, it is not a case of two nations fighting one another; it is a case of two opposing nations rising up to stumble Christians. The end result of the wars is not the downfall of Germany, England, China, or Japan, but the downfall of Christians. Satan's goal is to stumble Christians. A Christian has to realize the spiritual significance of all these things when a war breaks out.</p><p>The Lord continued in Matthew 24:13, saying that Christians should endure to the end when they are being hated in wars and tribulations. This will lead to their salvation. He said, "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations" (v. 14). During a war, God's children will be persecuted. This is why there is the need to endure. But at the same time, we have to preach the gospel. We also have to be a testimony among the Gentiles. Even if our testimony cannot spread to other nations or regions, it can spread to our city at least. The gospel of the kingdom must be preached continuously in the whole inhabited earth before the end will come.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORLD OPPOSING CHRIST AND THE CHRISTIANS</h2><p>The words in Acts 4:25 are quoted from Psalm 2:1-2, which says, "Why are the nations in an uproar,/And why do the peoples contemplate a vain thing?/The kings of the earth take their stand,/And the rulers take counsel together,/Against Jehovah and against His Anointed." Why are the nations in uproar? Why do they contemplate? They roar and contemplate the removal of Christ. When the Lord was on earth, Herod and Pontius Pilate attacked Him, God's anointed Christ. Although the Christ in the flesh is no longer on earth today, He is in all the Christians. Hence, the uproar and con- templation of the nations are aimed at Christians today.</p><p>Apparently the world is divided into alliances and nations. But tonight I hope that you do not see Germany, Japan, England, or China. You have to see that you are a Christian. In the eyes of God the nations roar and the peoples contem- plate vain things to attack Christ and God's people. Herod and Pilate were enemies of each other, but in the matter of crucifying Christ, they were one. The Jews and the Gentiles thought that they became one at Pentecost. But God said that at the time of Christ's crucifixion, both the Gentiles and the Israelites had gathered together to stand against Christ and to attack His Son.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE CHURCH'S PRAYER</h2><p>I do not know how to say this&mdash;it is not something that is easy to speak about. I can only say that the church in Shanghai must continue to pray for the Lord to take control of all the things that are happening and will happen in the world. Once war starts, many people lose their jobs, real estate goes down, gold is in demand, and banks close. Men are anxious to exchange their money for goods and try to horde them. Once war breaks out, the suffering party is the church. Christians will either suffer loss or be stumbled. They will suffer either materially or spiritually. There is bound to be suffering and loss in some areas. In these days we do not have time to enjoy entertainment; we have to pray in a specific way. Hades has only one goal&mdash;to afflict Christians. The future of 1940 and thereafter is bleak. Christians must have an enlarged view and see the reason and goal of this world war. Great changes may be coming starting tonight and continuing through next spring. If we have any strength at all, we should direct it to prayer. We must ask the Lord to take control of the situation so that God's children will not stumble and so that the gospel will continue to spread.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY</h1><h1 class="title">TALKS</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Afternoon, November 11, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded</h1><h2 class="head1">ON KNOWING GOD'S WILL</h2><p>Question: How can we know God's will?</p><p>Answer: Man can know God's will in three ways. First, some people have the Lord's mind, and they may know God's will directly. This knowledge comes directly from God. Second, a believer may not know God's will absolutely and completely, but through others God's will becomes more clearly and completely known to him. Third, God may have a will, yet He may not reveal it directly at all, instead relying fully on others to make it known. Of course, these must first know that God wants to use them to reveal His will. Take the case of Paul on the way to Damascus. It was Ananias who came and told him what he should do after he was saved (Acts 9:6).</p><h2 class="head1">PERSON AND CONDUCT</h2><p>Question: Was Paul right in going to Jerusalem?</p><p>Answer: The disciples at Tyre were clearly prompted by the Holy Spirit to discourage Paul from going to Jerusalem. If we say that it was right for Paul to go, this would mean that the Holy Spirit was wrong. If we say that it was wrong for him to go, can Paul's leading be wrong (Acts 20:22-24)? Moreover, Ananias received the word from the Lord: "This man is a chosen vessel to Me, to bear My name before both the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel" (9:15; 25:26; 26:1-2). Acts 21&mdash;28 is a record of Paul's visit to Jerusalem and the results of his visit. If Paul was wrong, these eight long chapters would have been the result of a wrong leading. But we cannot say that the disciples at Tyre were wrong either, because the Scripture clearly says that they acted under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (21:4), rather than the impulse of the flesh.</p><p>Who was right and who was wrong? The disciples were ahead of the Holy Spirit in speaking to Paul. This was their mistake. Even though their prophecy was factual and even though Paul would face danger when he went up to Jerusalem, there was another issue: Being a right person before the Lord and doing the right thing are two entirely different issues. If a man is wrong in the eyes of the Lord, it will be fruitless even if he does the right things. However, if a man is right before God, it is not that serious even if he does something wrong. (Do not misunderstand; this is not an encouragement for sinning.)</p><p>Abraham, Jacob, Noah, David, etc., all failed at one time or another. Abraham did many wrong things, whereas Lot was wrong only a little. But God considered Lot's little mistake very serious, and He was very severe toward him. Abraham, however, made many mistakes, but God did not deal with him as severely. God cares more for the right person than He does for the right things. Jacob was the right person, and although he did wrong things at times, God still loved him. Esau was the wrong person, and God was not pleased with him though he might have done many right things.</p><p>Being a right person before God and doing the right things are two entirely different issues. You can criticize Abraham or Jacob for making this or that mistake, but God still loved them. We look at what they did, but God looks at what they are. When the Lord came to the earth, a voice out of the heavens declared, "This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight" (Matt. 3:17). This was declared before He healed one sick person or delivered one sermon. It is a matter of the person rather than the works.</p><p>You may point out many mistakes that some people have made. What you say may be true, yet God loves them. Some people may do all the right things; you may not be able to find any fault in them. Yet God is not pleased with them. Some people can stand up and deliver a sermon and they can write books, but their standing up and their writings are all detestable acts in the eyes of God. I am not saying that our conduct is not important. I am merely saying that the person is more important that the conduct.</p><p>When I first became saved, I read the Old Testament and found many people for whom I had no respect at all. Their history was spotted with sins, yet God considered them good. It may not be hard for me to do better than Abraham or Jacob; in fact, I may quite surpass them. But it is difficult for me to match Abraham and Jacob in the way they understood God's love. Some people may surpass Abraham, David, or even Joseph in their conduct, but they lack one thing&mdash;they are not the right person in the eyes of God.</p><p>In the past I was quite free to criticize others. I was indeed a "first-class criticizer." I did not see one person whom I could not criticize. Even though I could criticize many people, I could not match them. I know of forty to fifty people whom the Lord loves. I doubt very much whether I can match them in the way they have pleased the Lord, even if I tried for my entire Christian life. These ones may make mistakes, but they&mdash;in their person&mdash;are right in the eyes of the Lord.</p><p>Once when I was abroad, I met two sisters and two brothers who spoke to me about Mr. Austin-Sparks' mistakes. I listened to them for almost a whole day. During that whole time, I felt that my ears were trash cans. Later, I said, "I am still looking for a more qualified person to criticize Brother Austin-Sparks." His person is right, and God has used him. What he has done is something else.</p><p>A brother once said to me, in reference to Brother Austin-Sparks, "Had he not done this and that, we would have invited him to speak at the Keswick Convention." I responded, "If Brother Austin-Sparks does not speak at the Keswick Convention, whose loss is it? It is the Convention's loss, not his loss. According to my knowledge of those who have spoken at Keswick, no one is qualified to criticize him."</p><p>In Shanghai some of our young people make many mistakes, yet these mistakes are forgivable. Other people are only half-wrong, yet one feels that they must be disciplined. In the first case, the person is right, while in the latter, the person is wrong. You may think that the elders in Shanghai are quite peculiar. Some people make mistakes, but these mistakes are accidental and excusable; the mistakes are not caused by a fundamental weakness in the person. Others make a mistake, not because they accidentally stumble, but because their persons are wrong; there is a problem with the persons themselves. A sinless Lot does not come close to a sinful and fallen Abraham. Although Abraham fell, he fell on top of Lot. Lot might have stood fast, but he stood under Abraham. If a man is not right in the eyes of God, his work and walk will never be pleasing to God.</p><p>When some people stand up to speak in the meeting, other brothers and sisters immediately groan within, saying, "Here he goes again." When still others stand up to speak, the brothers and sisters rejoice and praise, readily inclining their ears to hear them. However, the minute some people stand up, you know that they are the wrong persons.</p><p>It was not a big thing for Esau to take a bowl of red lintel soup. He was busy, thirsty, and tired when he returned from the field. But the New Testament tells us that Esau was a man who loved the world (Heb. 12:16). Some people may sin a hundred or a thousand times, yet their sins are outward, having nothing to do with their constitution. With others, sin is something in their constitution. Some people are sick, but they are like my mother who has thirteen different kinds of illnesses, none of which is fatal. Some people are infected with only one fatal sickness, and they die. Esau might have walked properly in his daily life, but he was in darkness; he did not have any revelation, nor did he have the voice of God. Jacob was the opposite. He might have been deceitful in his conduct and he might not have been as nice as Esau, yet he had the revelation, and God spoke to him. Some people are easily approved before God, while others are not. May the Lord be merciful to us and show us clearly whether we are right in His eyes.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD OF GOD</h2><p>Only that which issues from the depth will touch others' depth. Only the outflow of the indwelling Spirit will touch others. The Holy Spirit must operate not only in the speaker, but also in the listener. Only when the Spirit works simul- taneously in the speaker and the listener will God's word bring light and life. If a church is not living in the Spirit, it is not qualified to receive any deep messages, because it cannot tell the difference. The only thing that will give light and life to men is revelation from God. It is easy to conduct a revival meeting with some churches. With other churches, one must have some specific utterance from the Lord before he can speak anything with impact. Otherwise, all he can do is amuse others' ears and minds.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DELIVERANCE OF THE CROSS</h2><p>Brother Hsu asked: How can a wrong person receive deliverance from God?</p><p>Answer: It is useless to say anything to some people, either briefly or in detail. After they listen to you, they remain the same. This is like preaching to an unsaved person. No matter how well you explain salvation to him, he is still not saved. In order for us to experience deliverance, we first have to understand our sickness. We have to know of our problems. If we are dead, of course, we will know nothing about our problems. But as long as we are alive, we have to know our problems. The knowledge of our own problems is the first step toward deliverance. No one ever gives his own keys to others as a gift, because no two locks are the same. Even if we give someone our keys, they will not fit their lock. In order for us to solve others' problem, the first thing we have to do is to know what their problem is. The problem with many people is basically a mental one; their minds have never received the light of the truth. The way of deliverance lies in the cross.</p><p>The cross that I am talking about is not a cross in teaching or doctrine, but a cross that operates in our life in a real way. The cross works and operates through light, that is, the truth. This cross is not merely a historical fact or a doctrine, but a reality that operates through light. When the cross comes, it is light, and when it shines into the darkness within you, there is no escape; you will see and will receive the truth. The truth sets you free and delivers you. This is the cross. It is useless for you to know the doctrine of the cross merely in the mind; it will not produce any effect in your life. If you see the cross in revelation and are put on this cross, you will cease to live because the cross means nothing less than death. If you hear a message and afterwards you are still alive, it means that the message was merely a doctrine to you. The real cross is something drastic, something that forces you to have some dealings.</p><p>The cross manifests its power through the light. It is not a "thing" that suddenly comes to you; it is a light that shines on you. When you can no longer bear your natural life, the cross is operating. I must repeat this a hundred or even a thousand times: It is light that kills. The searing light of the cross will destroy you. It is not enough for you merely to know this fact from the Bible. You must realize the inner working of the cross through the Holy Spirit. Sin is a very obvious thing, yet many people still do not know what sin is. It is not a matter of how much Bible teaching you have, but of how much truth you realize. It is a matter of how much you have been enlightened and how much reality you have experienced. May the Lord shine on us constantly with the light of the cross. May everything that issues from the natural life be terminated and all natural energy and wisdom be removed so that we can become proper persons.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE LORD'S WORD<br />BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: November 13, 1940, midweek<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: John 6:63; Heb. 4:12; 2 Tim. 2:15</h1><h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>I know that some of you who are sitting here tonight do not need my word, but I hope that I am not mistaken in my leading. I wish to say something more concerning the Lord's word.</p><p>Second Timothy 2:15 shows us that God's worker must cut straight the word of the truth. Today many people pay attention to different ways of cutting God's word. They are clear whether a passage applies to the Jews or to the Gentiles. They know whether a passage is for Christians or for sinners. It seems that most of this so-called cutting work involves ascertaining whether a certain passage applies to a certain group of people.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVIDING OF THE SOUL AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p>However, something far more important is mentioned in Hebrews 4:12, yet this is merely doctrine to many people. They know what it says, but they have not actually seen it. This verse says that God's word is sharper than any two-edged sword. Have you ever experienced this? God's word divides the bones from the marrow, as well as the spirit from the soul. Do you know what this means? When a man asks whether something is of the flesh or of the Spirit, of God or of man, this indicates that this person does not have any light within him. If a man is living in the light, he will not ask such questions. A man is void of light because God's word has not divided his spirit from his soul. God's primary intention is not for us to divide His word, but for His word to divide us. We must be dealt with first. If we have not been dealt with, we cannot go too far. Whether a worker can render help to others depends on whether or not his spirit and soul are divided. Our spirit must be divided from our soul. Only after we have experienced such a dividing can we divide God's word.</p><h2 class="head1">DIVIDING GOD'S WORD</h2><p>God's word can be experienced in two different realms. The first is the realm of doctrine and theology. The second is the realm of spirit and life. It is not wrong to divide God's word, because Paul did tell us to divide or cut straight the word of God. However, much of the so-called dividing that we see today is not proper dividing, because the principle behind it is wrong. We must realize that the Bible is incomprehensible to the human mind. It cannot be understood by casual reading. God has no intention for man to fully understand His Word. If He wanted man to be fully clear, He could have written in explicit terms line by line. He did not write it in this way, but in the way described in Isaiah 28:10: "For his words are: Rule upon rule, rule upon rule;/Line upon line, line upon line;/Here a little, there a little." Many times when we read the Bible, we categorize, put words together, and then draw conclusions. Actually, we are not even that clear about our own salvation. How then can we possibly understand God's Word? God's Word is revealed to us a little here and a little there. Sometimes the words even seem contradictory. Take for example the truth of justification by faith. If it were up to us, we would have asked Paul and James to sit down together and work out a consensus before writing their Epistles. The same is true of the truth concerning holiness; many people have debated this truth and have ended up in quite an unholy condition. Many people misunderstand God's Word, yet God allows His Word to remain misunderstood. Many people dare not say the things that John, Peter, and Paul said because they are afraid of being misunderstood. Without some kind of categorization, it is true that God's Word can easily lead to misunderstanding.</p><p>Hebrews 6:10 says, "For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name in having ministered to the saints and in ministering still." The Lord does not clearly explain what this refers to. If I had written this verse, I would surely have explained what it referred to. All Scripture is God-breathed. Since He has chosen not to explain things as clearly to us as we would like, why should we be His counselor? Romans 11:33-34 says, "O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and untraceable His ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has become His counselor?"</p><p>Many passages in the Bible cannot be put together. Even though the theologians try to put them together, they cannot do it satisfactorily. Do we know what salvation, justification, and sanctification are? Can we really know God's Word? Thank God that although God's Word is beyond our full understanding, it becomes clear to us in our experience. If someone asks you whether you are a son of God, you may not be able to explain or write about it, but deep within, you are very clear about what you know. Others may ask whether you are saved or justified, and you may not be able to articulate it in an outward way, but inwardly you know. You may not have the doctrinal knowledge, but you know that you are a son of God and that you are saved.</p><p>Our knowledge of God's Word does not come through our categorization of His Word, but of His Word taking control of us from within. This is the way to know the Bible. God's Word can only be understood in a spiritual way, in the way of life. His Word cannot be understood in the flesh or the mind. If we do not understand God's Word in the way of spirit and life, we are on the wrong track. We can take the way of the theologians or Bible expositors, but this is not the way of life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF LIFE</h2><p>When a brother stands up to speak, others can tell whether he knows doctrines or life. If he speaks doctrines, he has to be cautious about what he speaks. Many people carefully word their speaking; there is no danger of making any errors. Their words are full of logic, sense, and reason. But these are merely theological teachings. Today speakers like to speak with clarity, and listeners like to hear words of clarity. But a speaking that is in life does not depend on perception, reason, logic, or classification. It depends on the dividing of the soul and the spirit.</p><p>Let me illustrate by an example. Andrew Murray once wrote a book on sanctification. But there was no conclusion to the subject of sanctification. After a person reads this book, he still may not know what sanctification is, yet he will receive the help. Mrs. Penn-Lewis, Oswald Chambers, and many others are not exactly accurate when it comes to using verses, yet their messages dispense life to others. Hundreds and thousands of men may quote verses better than they did, but they do not have the power of the Spirit. Some people are very accurate in their use of verses; they are careful to point out which passages are for the sinners, which passages are for the Christians, and which passages are for the Jews. But there is neither life nor spirit in their speaking. Some may not be able to give a complete message, yet they supply others with spirit and life. The outstanding thing about theology is its systematization of God's Word and the exposition of it. The goal of theology is to safeguard anyone from misunderstanding God's Word. However, the Bible never provides systematic judgment on such doctrines as salvation or sanctification. It does not explain itself, nor is it afraid of being misunderstood. The Bible does not lead men to God's Word through the mind, but through the spirit. The former line brings profit to the mind, while the latter line reaps profit in spirit and in life.</p><p>I once asked Miss M. E. Barber if there were any books on the cross that I could read. She answered, "Yes. But at your present stage, you cannot read them, and it would be unprofitable for you to read them." I could not hold back my curiosity, and a few days later I learned the names of the books in the course of our conversation. Later, someone gave me copies of those books, and I read right through them. On the one hand, I got some help, but on the other hand, I was greatly disappointed because the books did not answer my questions concerning the cross. I wished that the books had been written in a systematic way, but they were not written this way. My mind tried to sort out the theology and the doctrines, but God was trying to give me life. The books by Madam Guyon, which Brother Yu translated, do not contain much Bible exposition. But after one reads them, he receives the help. When one reads these books, he gets nourishment in life. But when he reads books on knowledge, he receives no nourishment in life. As servants of the Lord we should supply others with life and should not merely teach others doctrines.</p><p>Perhaps I should criticize myself a little. The Spiritual Man was published as a result of outward demands. As far as I was concerned, I was not that qualified to write that book. At that time the doctor said that I had only a few months more to live, and my thought was to put down what I had learned from the Lord. (Originally, I had thought of writing a very comprehensive exposition on the Bible, expounding all the subjects that men do not understand, could not understand, or would not understand.) I have decided not to publish this book again. This does not mean that there is anything wrong with The Spiritual Man. The problem is that the book is too complete; it contains theology and answers. As a result it is somewhat unspiritual&mdash;this is where the problem lies. God is after broken vessels, not nice vessels. God has no intention to see a book or a sermon so complete that a man can find all the answers without the need of the Spirit. The Lord knows the human weaknesses in every book and every sermon. This is why we need the leading of the Holy Spirit from within.</p><p>There are many passages in the Bible that we do not understand. We should not try deliberately to understand them, and even if we try to understand them, they will be of little profit to us. The Bible is for the nourishment of our life, not for knowledge. For example, we do not need a complete exposition on the doctrine of salvation. Even if the exposition is very complete, others may not be saved by it. Many people do not know very much, but they know that they are saved. Some think that after a man is saved, he should know whether or not "the root of sin" is eradicated. But all I know is that there is the law of sin in man, and that I cannot overcome it; I need God's law of life to overcome this law of sin within me.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S WORD BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2><p>God's Word is merely theological knowledge to many people; it is not life to them. But the Lord says that His word is spirit and life. The word of God touches our spirit and our life; it does not relate to our mind. It matters little if the mind does not understand. In reading a book or listening to a sermon, we can tell immediately whether we have touched spirit and life within or whether we have touched the mind. If we have heard only knowledge, the result is death, and we feel uneasy within. If we have heard spirit and life, the result is peace and assurance within.</p><p>The less mature a Christian is, the more answers he has. But God does not furnish definitive answers in the Bible. It is a sign of hyperactivity of the mind to demand clarity in doctrine. All we have to do is to take a passage, a verse, or a few sentences from the Scripture and speak it plainly. We only need to touch spirit and life; we do not need to build up others' intellect or give them much knowledge. If we touch spirit and life, others will be refreshed, and they will receive the genuine help.</p><p>When I was in London, I once sat with some out-of-town visitors during a message by Brother Sparks. Afterwards I asked whether they had received any help. They answered that the teaching was good, but that he had omitted many points. They only paid attention to theology. They were not there to receive life-nourishment, but mental knowledge. We would rather not touch so many points, but concentrate on one point which renders help to others. This is the value of spirit and life: It is sufficient if only one point within a broad subject touches others and meets their needs.</p><p>God is after a weak person, one who is dependent on Him. Those who truly know the cross are weak. May the Lord take away our desire to deliver perfect messages or to write perfect books, and may we not hinder the work of the Spirit. May we not exercise the kind of human wisdom and natural eloquence that will induce others' expectation for our speaking. A good message that only reaches others' minds is unprofitable. Many people are too good at speaking. As a result, others only see the speaker; they do not see God. They only hear man's words of wisdom; they do not hear the word of God.</p><p>I used to have my own standard concerning the messages I delivered and the books I wrote. Sometimes I would feel bad after delivering a message on Sunday, because I felt that I came short of my own expectation. Actually, God does not need to use our entire message, nor all the verses that we quote. Sometimes He only uses one or two words. The Bible says that God's word is life. We can ignore man's misunderstanding. If God is not afraid of misunderstanding, why should we be afraid of it? He is responsible for everything. Only the flesh tries to have a perfect message. God has no intention of achieving any perfection in the mind; He is only after perfection in spirit and life. We often feel discouraged when others do not understand our message. But actually, the hungry ones receive the help, while those who understand the message do not receive anything. The word of God is spirit and life; it divides the soul from the spirit. If a man has nothing to give except Bible knowledge, those who listen will find his speaking fruitless and childish.</p><p>Once I was about to meet a sister. Before she came to me I asked the Lord to stop me from using any words of wisdom. Words of wisdom can only educate the mind. I asked the Lord to give me words of light. When she came, I spoke much, but she was still unenlightened. At a certain point in the conversation, she suddenly became clear and asked me to repeat the sentence that had just helped her. She wanted to remember what I had just said. I told her that I did not know what I had said that had helped her. Later, I recalled what I had said and repeated it, and she tried to memorize it. This shows that the profit derived from God's word has nothing to do with one's memory; it has to do with spirit and life. Many people remember words that others have said, but these words do not render anyone any help. But many forgotten words are often the source of life supply.</p><p>Dividing the word of God does not mean merely breaking it down into sections and subdivisions. It has to do with the dividing of the soul and the spirit. It is like dividing the bone from the marrow by a sword. God's word often can bypass our mind and go straight into our spirit. Christ did not say that His words are theology, teachings, or answers. We know that many people are anti-theology and anti-teaching, but we are not talking about that here. We are saying that the Lord's word is spirit and life. Paul told Timothy to cut straight the word of the truth. However, only those who are cut by God can cut straight God's word. In our Bible we have to put Hebrews 4:12 before 2 Timothy 2:15. May the Lord speak to us within and deliver us from doctrines and theology, and may we truly know that God's word is spirit and life.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, remove our ambition for gaining knowledge. May we gladly prostrate ourselves in the dust. May we be delivered out of the superficiality of the Bible and into its depths.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE DISCOVERY OF A LAW</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: November 10, 1940<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: Rom. 7:21-25a</h1><h2 class="head1">PAUL'S DISCOVERY</h2><p>In Romans 7:21 Paul said, "I find then the law with me." This was a great discovery, which Paul discovered through much experience. In this world statistics are useful because we can use them to find out the facts and the true nature of things. Paul's spiritual experience has something to do with statistics. Through his many years of experience, he discovered that whenever he tried to do good, evil was present with him. If, out of the thousands and thousands of times that he tried to do good, evil was present every time, it meant that he was experiencing a law. If something repeatedly happens, the phenomenon constitutes a law. Paul discovered that sin was not something accidental or incidental, nor was it a careless mistake. He discovered that sin was abiding in him; there was a constant repetition of it. Through this he discovered sin as a law. This is a great discovery.</p><p>The amazing thing is that many Christians have never discovered such a law. This does not mean that this law does not exist in them. It merely means that they have not discovered it yet. Sin is not just an act, but a law. Since sin is a law, it does not matter how many different kinds of sin one commits. (This, of course, does not mean that I am telling you to sin more.) The fact is that a man never commits many different kinds of sins. You may be susceptible to a few sins, and I may be susceptible to a few other sins, but the number is never big. Every person commits, at most, a few major sins; these sins are especially powerful in him. It is these special sins that he frequently commits. Sin is a law, and since it is a law and not just an act, victory over sin cannot be accomplished through an act, but through another law.</p><p>Paul was defeated by one sin&mdash;greed. This refers not only to the coveting of others' possessions as prohibited by the Ten Commandments, but to a lust in one's heart as well. Many people think that the sin of covetousness is what a thief commits when he enters into another person's house to steal. Actually, sin is something that dwells within man. Whether such a sin is turned into an action or not, the fact is that it is still sin. For example, if one has a temper within him, whether or not this temper is manifested, it is still temper. Those who are talkative are always talking whether or not they open their mouth, and whether they are standing or sitting down. Those who are proud are, of course, arrogant when they accomplish something, but they are also arrogant when they cannot do anything. They are proud before those who are inferior to them, and they are also proud before those who are superior to them. The only time when they are not proud is when they are no longer themselves.</p><p>One young man is very talkative. Whenever others see him, they find him talking. Whether or not you want to listen to him, he still wants to talk to you, and he always insists that you listen to him. One day I met this man with another sister and a host. I thought that he was going to talk, and I was preparing to listen, but he did not speak that day. Everyone was silent for about ten minutes. Later, I learned that the reason he did not speak was that he was sick. Talkativeness is a law in this person. He only stopped speaking when he was sick and too weak to speak. Many people only know of sin as a kind of weakness. They do not see that sin is a law. If something remains the same way all the time and in every place, it is a law.</p><p>One man was very proud. Whenever he sat down, others around him could sense his arrogance. He was arrogant even when he tried to speak in a humble way. While he was speaking, his words may have sounded humble, but his person remained proud. His humility was forced. This kind of arrogance and false humility is actually worse than pride. With many people their sacrifice is worse than their parsimony, their love is worse than their hatred, and their humility is worse than their pride. This is because their sacrifice, love, and humility are all artificial.</p><p>Before I was saved, it was easy for me to lose my temper, and it was easy for me to be proud. After I believed in the Lord, I discovered that I still yielded easily to temper and pride, and I tried my best to deal with these sins and to overcome them. Yet I discovered that patience was something bound by time. I could temporarily put off my temper, but I could never be free of my temper. It is foolish to try to fight a law. In order to be free from sin, the prerequisite is understanding that sin is a law. As long as a man continues to consider sins as isolated and incidental weaknesses, he cannot be free from sin. Paul experienced deliverance when he discovered sin as a law. The turning point for Paul was in verse 21, not in verse 25. Verse 21 is like a bridge with a stretch of road on both sides. In Romans 7:7-20 Paul gave a testimony of his own history. He was continually defeated, and he found it useless to try to overcome by his will. Verse 21 is a grand conclusion to his failures in verses 7 through 20. It was also the beginning of a great discovery of a law. He said, "I find...." Such a discovery was an inward discovery; it was not a mental discovery. The law in Romans 7:7-20 refers to the outward Ten Commandments. After verse 21 the law becomes something spiritual and inward. Many people are familiar only with the law at Sinai. They try their best to do good and satisfy the demands of the law, but they fail again and again. God's demand comes as a law. Man's failure to answer to such a law is also a law. Moses gave the law to the Israelites at Mount Sinai, and Paul also passed on a law to us in Romans 7.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WILL NOT BEING ABLE<br />TO WITHSTAND THE LAW OF SIN</h2><p>The statistics of sin are the cumulative experiences of all our sins. When they are exhibited before our eyes, we can do nothing but bow down and confess our failure. Paul struggled so hard that he eventually discovered sin to be a law. Sin is not something accidental or incidental; it happens spontaneously. Unless many people first experience the "I find..." in 7:21, they can never have the "thanks be to God" in verse 25. Without discovering this, they find themselves going around in circles for many years.</p><p>A man can have a tooth removed when it bothers him, but he cannot get rid of a law with an operation. For example, consider the traffic lights at a crossroad. You can run the red light once, twice, or many times without being caught by the police. But you cannot run the red lights all the time. Sooner or later you will be caught by the police. Halting at a red light is a law, and one cannot forever go against this law. Sin is not the result of an accidental weakness in the will. Do not try to fight with sin, because sin is a law. This law of sin is very real within man, and it is impossible for man to overcome the law of sin with his own strength. Once you realize that sin is a law, you should no longer try to fight it. If you try to fight it, you will lose because a law cannot change; it remains the same forever.</p><p>Romans 6 and 7 are the foundation for spiritual growth. Unless sin is dealt with, nothing can be accomplished. Yet it is impossible for us to overcome sin by our will. A man can hold up a hymnal by his will, but he cannot do this forever. At the beginning he may not feel the weight of it, but gradually it becomes heavier and heavier. Actually, the hymnal has not increased in weight, but the force of gravity operates on the hand and wears it out. If you try to be good and love others by yourself, you will be like the hand in the illustration above. Sooner or later you will become tired, and sooner or later you will have to resign. It is a losing prop- osition to fight the force of gravity. It is also a losing proposition to counter this evil law with our good will. Our need today is to acknowledge our corruption in Adam and our newness in Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF DELIVERANCE</h2><p>The way of deliverance is to realize that sin is a never-changing law. When we lose hope in ourselves, we will breathe a sigh of relief just like Paul did. Salvation does not depend on any resolution we make within ourselves; it depends on our Savior. The law of sin has no effect on our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. He is not only free from sin; He is a sinless man. In Him there is no law of sin. Today this Christ lives within us as our life, and we have a new law. The law of sin does not exist in Christ; He is like a helium balloon that is constantly ascending. We can hold down a helium balloon for a while, but we cannot hold it down forever. Today Christ lives within us, and there is a new life and a new law that overcomes the law of the will of the old man. Yet many people have not yet discovered this. This is like a person who has never opened a gift that he has received. It is very precious to realize the blessings that come from a genuine regeneration. What we have received is not just a life, but a new law, and this law is able to overcome the law of sin.</p><p>One brother once remarked, "When I exercise my will, I lose my temper less and sin less. Not exercising my will would be unthinkable." But this is not the Christian way. The Christian way is not in the exercise of the will, but in the discovery of another law. In the illustration of the hymnal and the hand, it matters little where you put the hymnal; the law of gravity operates everywhere. If you are not regenerated, it is true that you should not let go of your will. You must control yourself before you can behave in a more proper manner. Once you let go, you will sin, just as the force of gravity will act on any object that is placed in your hand. A regenerated Christian, however, will not need to struggle or strive to do good or to free himself from sin. There is a law within him, the law of life. A Christian first discovers the law of sin and then the law of life. Without discovering the law of sin, one cannot discover the law of life. Today many people do not know that sin is a law. As a result they do not know anything about the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8. I am not merely teaching; I am helping you to know this law. First we must realize that sin is a law, and then we must realize the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8. This is the way we will overcome sin.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, in the past we considered sins to be isolated events and countable acts of transgressions. We did not realize that sin is a law. Today we have seen that these seemingly isolated sins are actually a law. Lord, these words may be repetitious, but may those who have heard them receive blessing from them.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Friday, November 15, 1940<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: 2 Pet. 1:1; 1 Cor. 1:30; Phil. 3:9</h1><h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2><p>We have already seen that a saved person should know a few things. First, he should know that he is a son of God.  Second, he should know God's righteousness. Third, he should know the righteousness of Christ and that Christ has become the believers' righteousness. Now we want to consider the difference between the righteousness of Christ and Christ as our righteousness. There is a big difference between these two things, and we must differentiate them clearly.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST</h2><p>Most people think that after we become a Christian, everything of Christ becomes ours. But the Bible does not say that we are saved by the righteousness of Christ or that the righteousness of Christ has become our righteousness. The phrase the righteousness of Christ is only used in 2 Peter 1:1, in reference to Christ's own righteousness. Without the righteousness of Christ, we cannot have a Savior. Christ is the Savior because He is righteous. But His righteousness is only related to Him. The righteousness of Christ qualifies and enables Him to be our Savior.</p><p>When we read the Bible, we should not change what we read. We should not be satisfied with vague concepts and answers. During the past ten or more years, I have often asked others two questions: By what righteousness are we saved? By whose righteousness do we come to God? Many people could not give the proper answer. They would say that they are saved by the righteousness of Christ and that they come to God through Christ's righteousness. This is absolutely wrong. Let me put it this way: The righteousness of Jesus was the qualification which the Lord had before God when He was a man. This righteousness has absolutely nothing to do with us. We are not joined to the Lord in His walk in this world; we are joined to Him on the cross. Everything that the Lord did on earth has nothing to do with us. We must remember that a grain bears many grains only after it has fallen into the ground. Christians were joined to Christ at His death, not at His birth. When Christ was born in Bethlehem and lived on the earth, men could only follow Him from afar. They could only say, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" (John 1:29). Only when we come to Romans 6 do we see that we are joined to Him in the likeness of His death and resurrection (v. 5). Therefore, a Christian does not become righteous in the eyes of God through the righteousness of Christ, but through Christ Himself. We are saved through receiving Christ Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BECOMING OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>Once I was talking to a theological student. I said, "The Bible does not say that we have put on the righteous garment of Christ. It only says that we have put on Christ." Galatians 3:27 says that we have put on Christ. Today we have not put on the righteousness of Christ, but Christ Himself. The righteousness of Christ is something that is in Christ Himself, and it is history. Today Christians come to God through putting on Christ. Christ Himself has become our righteousness, and we can come to God at any time because Christ lives forever.</p><p>How can we, as sinful persons with so many failures, come to God? Why should God answer our prayer? One sister did not feel that temper was a sin, and she would not deal with it. Later, she could not get over a particular matter, and she wanted to have a thorough dealing before the Lord. She called me by phone and made an appointment to talk to me. I told her to go and pray. She took my word and went to pray. Before she went to God, the subject of righteousness was not in her thought. However, as soon as she turned to God, the matter of righteousness came. She thought to herself, "With what kind of righteousness should I come to God?" Then she realized that her temper was a sin, and she acknowledged that she did not have any righteousness of her own. A new believer very often prays and asks, "What is my basis for coming to God?" Suppose you are in your bedroom. You can dress any way you like, but when you meet a guest, you have to properly attire yourself. No one ever dresses up to go to bed. This is because you are alone when you go to bed, and there is no need to dress up. But during the day you have to meet people; consequently, you have to dress up. In the same way, as soon as a man comes to God, he considers how he should dress. When a certain member of one's family is sick or in trouble and he is forced to come to God, he often suddenly remembers many sins that he has otherwise ignored.</p><p>How do we come to God? First Corinthians 1:30 is a great verse in the New Testament. This verse reveals that a Christian does not come to God through his own righteousness. Neither does he come to God with his many sins. Rather, he comes to God through Christ alone. A Christian's access to God is not based on his righteousness or his unrighteousness. This verse shows us clearly that Christ has become the righteousness of the believers. It is not something about Christ that has become our righteousness; rather, Christ Himself in His entirety has become our righteousness. Something of Christ can never be as absolute and perfect as Christ Himself. When Christ Himself becomes our righteousness, God receives us.</p><p>The experience of many Christians follows a certain pattern: If they read the Bible in the morning and manage to control their temper during the day, they can pray in a strong way at night. But if they fail during the day, their prayer at night is very weak. Actually, even when we sin, Christ is still our righteousness. The fact has not changed, because we are in Christ. If we behave well today and think that we are more qualified to come to God, we are coming to Him by our own righteousness. This is a wrong concept. God does not receive us based on our righteousness, much less on our unrighteousness. His receiving is based on Christ. A Christian does not become more unrighteous through sinning, nor does he become more righteous through doing good. Sin does not diminish a Christian's righteousness, nor do good works increase his righteousness. Our righteousness before God is not dependent on our conduct, but on Christ Himself. Our righteousness before God never changes. Righteousness is a person; it is not a thing. The righteousness that a Christian has is the living Christ; it is not some dead object. Even if we committed all the sins of the world, our righteousness is still Christ Himself. Sooner or later every Christian must realize who this One is who is his righteousness.</p><h2 class="head1">PUTTING ON CHRIST</h2><p>The robe of righteousness is a good illustration, yet it is not a perfect illustration. In the Old Testament, Jacob cheated his father in order to receive his blessing. Jacob's brother was a hairy man, but he was a smooth man. Rebekah gave to Jacob the coat of Esau and covered his hands and neck with the skin of goats in an effort to steal his father's blessing. This is a disguise; it is falsehood. This is not the way Christians come before God. We have not put on a robe of righteousness; we have put on Christ Himself. We have not put on the garment of Christ; we have put on Christ Himself. Galatians 3:27 speaks of the putting on of Christ. The righteousness which we now have far exceeds our own righteousness. It is Christ Himself becoming our righteousness. Hence we are perfect, and God can now accept us.</p><p>What is our basis when we come to God? What is in our mind when we come before Him? Are we fearful when we think of our sin and bold when we think of our righteousness? Or do we think of Christ? Many people are occupied with either their sins or their righteousnesses. Let me allude to the sister that I spoke of earlier. I eventually went to her home and asked about her prayer life. She answered, "I cannot pray well because I have a bad temper." I said, "God does not answer you when you have a bad temper, and He does not answer you when you have a good temper either." She could not understand my word. I sat in my chair and said, in an apparently arrogant way, "I am better than you are in one thing: I have confidence that the Lord answers my prayer. What do you think?" She said, "I do not believe this. This is only what you claim." I said, "I may be as good or as bad as you are, or I may be worse than you are. But the righteousness that I have believed and received is different from yours. I come to God through Christ as my righteousness, not through the righteousness of Christ. Before the Lord I have my own righteousnesses as well as my own unrighteousnesses. Of course, my own unrighteousnesses cannot be reckoned as righteous in His eyes, but my righteousness cannot be reckoned as righteous in His eyes either. This has nothing to do with me loving Him but with Him loving me. I do not preserve myself; He preserves me. It is not my hands that are holding Him but His hands that are holding me. It is not a matter of my faithfulness but His faithfulness." I may have sinned more than all of you sitting here, but I can be bold before the Lord because my righteousness is Christ alone.</p><p>A new believer's condition can be quite high, like Paul's experience in the third heavens. At other times it can be quite low, as if he has descended into the abyss. However, we have to realize that the problem of sin has been dealt with by Christ on the cross, and the problem of righteousness has also been settled by Christ on the throne. The righteousness that God has given us is just Christ. Once He gives Christ to us, He will never change His mind. In Christ, God cannot find anyone more advanced than He has already found. This is why our heart rejoices today. When we first believed, the basis of our coming to God was Christ. After being a believer for many years, the basis of our coming to God is still Christ. Our advancement cannot make us more qualified to come to God, and our evil cannot make us less qualified to come to God. Hebrews 4:16 says that we can come forward boldly to God at any time.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND OUR CONDUCT</h2><p>I have been a Christian for over twenty years. My conduct has changed, but my righteousness has never changed. It will not change in another twenty years because my righteousness is the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Even if I become as fallen as Demas or Alexander the coppersmith, I will not be more unrighteous than I already am. On the other hand, even if I suffer as much as Paul did, love the Lord as much as John did, and am as bold as Peter was, it will not increase my righteousness at all. My conduct may improve, but my righteousness can never improve. I can advance in holiness, but I cannot advance in my righteousness, because the righteousness that God has given me is already perfect. This righteousness is just Christ. I am the most righteous person on earth because my righteousness is just Christ. Just as Christ never changes and is well pleasing to God, I cannot change, and I am well pleasing to Him.</p><p>Once this issue is settled, all the problems that a Christian faces are settled. We have seen that righteousness has nothing to do with sin. Sin is one thing, righteousness is another. If our coming to God is based on this righteousness, Satan can do nothing to accuse us. I hope that we will not take these words as just a kind of doctrine. In the course of our fellowship with God, we have to see something new. We have to see that man's condition before God can be good or bad, but his position before God can never change. If our life as a Christian lasts for twenty or thirty more years on this earth, we may become more advanced, holy, spiritual, or mature, but our righteousness will not change. It will not afford us more boldness, nor will it take away any of our boldness, because our righteousness is simply Christ Himself.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">TALKS</h1><h1 class="title">(5)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: November 19, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded</h1><h2 class="head1">THE LOVE OF THE CROSS</h2><p>Brother Yu Cheng-hwa asked: How can we practice the teachings of Matthew 5? In our daily life we still live very much by the natural life and the flesh. How can we obey the Lord's commandments in Matthew 5?</p><p>Answer: Man's mental capacity is limited; he cannot bear too much burden. Once the burden becomes too heavy, he subconsciously discharges this burden to his physical body, which may result in sicknesses like tuberculosis or heart disease. If he does not discharge his burden to his physical body, his mental health becomes overtaxed. If this condition deteriorates, he may lose his mind and become insane. Whenever there is discontentment, worry, burden, or anger, the first thing a person tries to do is to discharge them to the body. The second thing he tries to do is to withstand them with his mental faculties. When he cannot withstand them, he becomes sick and loses his mind. Humanly speaking, it is difficult for a Christian to practice Matthew 5 and pressing it would only lead to sickness of the body. Those who are patient are thin very often, because they try all the time to practice patience by themselves. If anyone treats you unjustly, like what is described in Matthew 5, you should unload your burden to the spirit. When you refuse the burden and allow the Lord to bear it for you, you have the cross. The cross is something that the Lord bears; it is not something that you have to bear. The cross is the opposite of one's work. Where there is work, there is no cross, and where there is the cross, one does not have to work by himself.</p><p>If you love a person, and he asks you to walk with him for a mile or to give him your tunic, it is easy for you to obey. You have no problem with his request. In fact, you might be afraid that he will not ask. When two lovers are together, they can walk for twenty miles without feeling tired. The practice of Matthew 5 is based on the love of the cross. With this love everything becomes easy. Many people try to act like a Christian, but God has never asked us to act like a Christian. The cross is good for our physical well-being. Unfortunately, many people do not know the cross because they take all of their burdens upon themselves and try to endure everything by themselves. The cross is even good for your mental health. When you lay everything on the cross, your problems all vanish away. Many Christians die early because they try to shoulder all of their problems in their bodies. This is asceticism; it is not Matthew 5. It is mortification, not the flow of life. Everyone who tries to endure by himself is not bearing the cross. I have not met one Christian whose physical and mental strength is so strong that he can withstand every suffering. We are Christians; we do not have to act like Christians.</p><p>Hebrews 1:3 says that the Lord upholds all things by the word of His power. God entrusts all things to the Lord's hand. Do we dare to entrust all things to His hands as well? If God only gave us Matthew 5 without giving us the cross, He would be a cruel God. Man pays attention to work, excitement, or stimulation. Those who are better pay attention to good deeds. But all these are works accompanied by the sweat of the brow. This is the Old Testament. The New Testament is for us to not work, and for Christ to do all the work (Gal. 2:20).</p><p>No affair or thing should demand so much earnestness from us that we cannot go on without it. But for some people, this is exactly how they feel. They are as earnest as the priest of Baal contending with Elijah on Mount Carmel. God is omnipotent; there is no need for us to expend so much energy in our prayer.</p><p>Many Christians live in the realm of behavior. They think that God wants them to do many things. What will you do if one day you find that God does not want you to do anything? It is true that genuine work is a cooperation between us and God, but the question is where the source of energy comes from, and what the goal of such a work is. The Christian life should be a very spontaneous thing; it should not be a painful living, because God's life is within us.</p><p>An elderly sister lived in the countryside. Her son was a sailor and always away from home. She was forced to live by herself. One night a thief came and began to steal things and move furniture around. When the old lady heard the noise she got up and lit a lamp. When she saw the thief she asked, "Do you need any help? Are you in a hurry?" She began to prepare some noodle soup for him. When the day was about to break, the thief ate the bowl of soup and left without taking anything. There was no hatred in the old lady, only love. Although she did not know the teaching in Matthew 5, she had the law of the Spirit of life within her, and she was able to treat the thief this way.</p><p>In eternity many things will still advance, but one thing has reached perfection already&mdash;love. This is something that is perfect today. The Lord said, "You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matt. 5:48). The perfection spoken of in Matthew 5 is the perfection of the love of the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">A GENUINE BEARER OF THE CROSS</h2><p>A crucified person is not a wounded person. Those who are wounded are not crucified. A crucified one is a kingly one. Only those who are small need forgiveness. Those who are on the throne can forgive others. Many people seek sympathy and pity when they are suffering. When Christ was crucified on the cross, He was a King (Matt 27:37). He could forgive others. He did not blame others, and He prayed for others. Something came out of His side to supply others. He shed His blood to forgive others' sins, and He released water to dispense His life to others. Hence, the great ones are the ones who are on the cross.</p><p>When Christ died, He was not escaping; He was shouting loudly, committing His soul to the Father. When some Christians suffer, I pity them, but when a Christian bears the cross, I respect him and honor him. I will bow down my head and say, "Here is a person who really knows God." I can approach a cross-bearer on my knees, just as the magi in the East came to the Lord when they offered Him the gifts. Stephen was stoned to death. His persecutors were small while Stephen was great. He knelt down and prayed loudly. He did not pray after he was smitten to the ground. How trying were his circumstances! Yet none of the voices could drown his prayer for his persecutors. Pity cannot come near such a person; one can only honor and respect him.</p><p>A person who is suffering is not necessarily bearing the cross. I know of one person who has never borne the cross during the twenty years that I have known him, because he did not have the kingly resemblance of one who is on the cross. I have never heard of a person beneath the cross forgiving one who is on the cross. I have never heard of man forgiving God. Only those who are on the cross can forgive those who are beneath it. These words are not for those who are proud. Only those who are crucified can forgive and love others, and only they can walk an extra mile and part with a tunic. A cross-bearer never pities himself and does not need pity from others.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, SANCTIFICATION, AND REDEMPTION</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 1, 1940, mid-week meeting<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 3:4; John 8:24, 28</h1><p>Spiritual deliverance is the result of seeing; it is not the result of hearing. Other than Christ, God has not given anything to man. But it is strange that even though man claims that he knows this fact and has heard it already, he may still hold on to many things apart from Christ.</p><p>The main cause of poverty is pride. Pride is evil, and it is foolish to be proud. Only those who are in darkness can be proud. Everything that man is proud of is worthless in the eyes of God. Unfortunately many people do not realize this; they do not realize how worthless the things that they take pride in are. Those who are in the light will never be proud even if you force them to be so. Light alone can strip a person of everything. It shatters him and restricts his vision to the Lord alone. The whole matter rests on how much we have seen the Lord. If we have not seen Him, our experiences are merely isolated events. Even if these experiences are scriptural or spiritual, they are worthless in the eyes of the Lord.</p><p>First Corinthians 1:30 is one of the great verses in the New Testament: "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption." The colon after the phrase "who became wisdom to us from God" indicates that wisdom includes righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p><p>We must note that this verse does not say that Christ has become our Justifier, Sanctifier, or Redeemer. It says that Christ has become our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are three important items in God's salvation. On the one hand, we have to know that Christ is our objective Justifier, Sanctifier, and Redeemer, but on the other hand, we have to go on to know that Christ is our subjective righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Many people can testify that Christ is their Justifier, Sanctifier, and Redeemer, but they do not know that Christ is also their righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. We must consider what it means for God to say that Christ is our wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BECOMING OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>Man needs righteousness when he comes before God. Righteousness has much to do with God. As soon as we think about God, the question of righteousness comes in. Suppose you leave your bedroom and go downstairs to meet a guest. The first thing that comes to your mind is the way that you are dressed. You will surely tidy up a little. Similarly, when man comes to God, the first thing that comes to his mind is the question of righteousness. Without righteousness no man can see God. In the Christian life, righteousness is a very basic matter. If a Christian has not settled the issue of righteousness, his foundation is not secure.</p><p>Christians often consider righteousness to be something related to conduct. The world also thinks that man's righteousness has to do with his conduct. When it says that a man is not righteous, it means that his conduct is not very good. This is why Christians often come to God based on their own conduct. If their conduct on a certain day is poor or if they have lost their temper and engaged in arguments, they dare not pray when they come to the prayer meeting. Even when they pray, they can only pray in a soft voice. But if they behave well on that day and do not lose their temper or argue with others, they will pray with a loud voice in the prayer meeting. These Christians are using their own conduct as the standard of their righteousness. But God takes Christ as the standard of our righteousness.</p><p>I have found one interesting thing in my life&mdash;conduct and righteousness are two different things. In the past I thought that my conduct constituted my righteousness when I came to God. Now I see that only Christ is my righteousness. Our conduct is not our righteousness. I have discovered that my righteousness is a person, the One who is sitting on the throne. Brothers and sisters, we can improve our conduct; we can be more diligent and love others as ourselves, but none of these things can be counted as our righteousness. Our conduct can improve and change; it can change for better or for worse, but this will not change our righteousness, because our righteousness is the unchangeable One on the throne. Now I come to God through Him. Ten or twenty years from now, I will still come to God through Him. He does not change.</p><p>Such a revelation will greatly change your Christian life. You will see that good behavior cannot justify your boasting before the Lord, nor should bad behavior become a cause for discouragement before Him. Only Christ is your righteousness! This is a law, something that will never change. You can criticize my poor conduct, but you cannot criticize my righteousness. Christ as my righteousness is unblamable. My righteousness is Christ&mdash;this is the greatest salvation. A Christian can be a believer for ten years and improve his conduct in many ways, but until he realizes that Christ is his righteousness, he will not know what salvation is. Simply listening to this message will not give you deliverance; deliverance only comes when you have a true revelation. In the past you received Christ as your Savior. Now you need to receive Christ as your salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BECOMING OUR SANCTIFICATION</h2><p>Sanctification is a much-debated topic today. As far as we know, all the teachings on sanctification take sanctification as a moral virtue, an act, or an inward condition. They all consider sanctification to be a thing, an object. If a person has this kind of concept, it means that he does not know what it means for Christ to be our sanctification.</p><p>Some Christians have a natural concept concerning sanctification. They think that sanctification is Christ coming to us and helping us become holy. What they are really saying is that they are not holy and that Christ is helping them to become holy. However, 1 Corinthians 1:30 says that Christ Jesus became to us from God sanctification. We are not sanctified through ourselves or through the help of Christ. Rather, Christ Himself has become our sanctification. Sanctification is in Christ, not in us. Sanctification is the person of Christ, not the help of Christ.</p><p>Other Christians think that sanctification is Christ giving us the power to become sanctified. Actually, man can never be sanctified, and God has no intention to give man the power to become sanctified. God's Word tells us clearly that Christ Jesus became to us from God sanctification. Our sanctification is a gift, a person, not the result of some kind of empowering. Only those who have seen this revelation can tell the difference between these two things. Only they can see the great distance between them. This revelation is not something that one can fathom with his mind. We must ask God to show us something; we must see that Christ did not come to help us to be holy. Neither did He come to give us the power to be holy. Rather, Christ Himself has become our sanctification.</p><p>Many Christians think that with sanctification there is a need for the power of sanctification on the one hand and a need to bear the fruit of sanctification on the other hand. They think that they will produce the fruit of sanctification if they have the power of sanctification. But where do they place Christ in this process? Most people say that Christ is necessary for power, because power will enable us to bear the fruit of sanctification. However, 1 Corinthians 1:30 does not say that Christ is a power to empower us to sanctification. Instead, it says that Christ Himself is our sanctification. We can have sanctification only after we have Christ, and we can have the fruit of sanctification only after we have Christ. Brothers and sisters, we may consider sanctification to be a thing, but God's Word shows us that Christ is that very thing. Our sanctification is a living person&mdash;Christ. Christ is our sanctification.</p><p>Suppose I am a proud person with no humility whatsoever. I can be aware of my pride, but I cannot humble myself. I may pray to God, saying, "Be merciful to me. Lord Jesus, empower me and make me humble." I think that I need the power of humility in order to be humble myself. If Christ helps me and empowers me, I think that I will surely become humble. I pray and ask for help, but this is only my own concept. It is not God's way of salvation. God has not given us the power of humility, but humility itself. God has given us a perfected humility&mdash;Christ. Is the Lord powerful? Of course He is. Has God given us this power? Surely He has. But why are we still so weak? Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that the Lord's power is real, but this power is not accessible to us as a thing. Even if we can be humble and even if we can have a perfect performance, we only have an act of humility at the most. Within us we still do not have humility itself. Humility is Christ Himself, not the power of Christ.</p><p>We should pray, "Lord, You are my humility. God has made You my humility. I ask that You live out Your humility from within me." This is the right attitude. In asking the Lord to be our humility, we should lift up our head and say, "Lord, I have no humility of my own. Be my humility and live out humility on my behalf." If we look to Him in this way, our humility will not be our own. Instead the Lord will become our humility, and our humility will no longer be a conduct, but a living person&mdash;Christ Himself.</p><p>When I was young, I loved to watch slide projection shows at school. After I believed in the Lord, the slide shows became a frequent illustration I used. The light behind the slides never changes, but the slides change all the time. Sometimes the light illuminates scenery, and sometimes it illuminates some kind of atmospheric phenomenon. Sometimes the light illuminates landscapes, and sometimes it illuminates flowers and trees. In the same way all virtues are just the different expressions of Christ being reflected in us. Humility, meekness, and patience are not works that we do; they are virtues of Christ. They are the very human virtues of Christ. In fact, they are just Christ Himself. All the different virtues radiate from the one unchanging life of Christ. These different virtues are produced as a result of the many different kinds of environments. Hence, the virtues of a Christian are not different types of conduct, they are the result of Christ being reflected in him. This is the meaning of Christ being our sanctification.</p><p>We do not need to manufacture a holiness of our own. Rather, we reflect Christ as holiness. Such a revelation and knowledge forms the basis of our Christian life. Many Christians are striving to be humble, obedient, and meek. Little do they realize that they are not producing reflections of Christ, but "products" of their own effort. Actually, none of these virtues can be planned or manufactured.</p><p>When many Christians try to forgive, they pray for the Lord's strength. Then they try to muster their own strength to forgive. Even then they find that they cannot forgive. We have to see that when our forgiveness runs out, we should ask the Lord to be our forgiveness. We should acknowledge that we cannot forgive in ourselves and that there is no forgiveness in us. We should lift up our head and say to the Lord, "I have been wrong. I have tried to be a Christian on my own. I will no longer do this. Lord, I will allow You to live out of me." The whole issue rests with the Lord Himself, not with you.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BECOMING OUR REDEMPTION</h2><p>Christ is not only our Redeemer; He has become our redemption. Not only has He become our sanctification in our inward constitution, He has become our redemption in our outward body. If the Lord Jesus was only our Redeemer, He and we would still be separate. Thank the Lord that He is not only our Redeemer; He has become our redemption. Hence, our redemption is not just a thing, but a person who is joined to us. First Corinthians tells us that the Lord will appear one day. At that time all those who believe in Him will receive God's redemption; that is, the dead will be raised and those who are living will be changed (15:52). On the day of redemption we will be manifested as the sons of God and will reign with Him. None of this is the result of any doing of our own. Just as we were not saved by works, we also should not live according to our works. Our assurance, whether it is related to our salvation, walk, or rapture, is based on Christ.</p><p>When two Christians died once, I said to some, "When a Christian dies, he is not buried; he is sown." First Corinthians 15:42-44 does not speak of "burying," but of "sowing." We know that there is a difference between sowing something and burying something. Anything that is sown will eventually grow up. But anything that is buried is buried; it will not grow. As Christians we do not have cemeteries; we only have gardens. What we sow will one day grow up. Christ is within us, and He is also in our body. This Christ is not bound by death. Death cannot hold Him. On that day, neither death, nor the grave, nor Hades, nor Satan will stop us from rising, because the resurrected Christ has become our redemption.</p><p>The end of an unbeliever is burial. His death is an entrance into an eternal grave. Although there will be the second resurrection, this resurrection is different from those participating in the first resurrection. Unbelievers will be judged at the second resurrection; they will enter the second death, which is the greater death (Rev. 20:14-15).</p><p>A child once asked me, "Does it take much effort for Christians to be raptured?" To the child the rapture requires a great deal of effort. If we see that Christ is our redemption, this kind of question will not arise. A Christian is raptured because he has Christ within him. Going to the throne is an effortless matter. May the Lord open our eyes to see that there are not many things or objects in Christianity. Everything is Christ. This is not a theory, but a reality. Christianity is not a religion of works. It is not a matter of works, but a matter of life. The first step in our salvation is regeneration: "You must be born anew" (John 3:7). The last step is the redemption of the body. From beginning to end, everything is based on "Christ our life" (Col. 3:4). Christ is not here to be outward things to us. He has come into us to become our life.</p><p>Many people say that love is a thing, that gentleness is a disposition, and that humility is an attitude. But we must see that all these things do not depend on what we do, but on our knowledge of Christ. What we know concerning Christ is what truly matters. The Bible tells us that Christ is the "I AM" (John 8:24-28). His name is the "I AM." These verses do not tell us what He is. This means that He is whatever we need. In one circumstance He is love. In another circumstance He is humility. This love and humility are not merely love and humility per se, they are a living person. Christ becomes our love. Christ becomes our humility. Some of us have already realized this. I hope that all the brothers and sisters can have such a realization.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, besides You, we have no greater reward. You are the great things, and You are the small things. By Your mercy and blessing, may these incomplete and imperfect words remove our veils and shine within us so that we can truly know You as the "I AM." In Your name we pray, amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">POVERTY AND RICHES</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 4, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Mal. 3:10; Rev. 3:17</h1><p>Many of God's children do not know that they are poor. In fact, many Christians have fallen into the condition of the Laodiceans. In spiritual matters it is easy to deal with those who are empty, but it is very difficult to deal with the poverty that comes from self-proclaimed riches. It is difficult to do anything with a person who lives in this kind of poverty. He seems to know everything, yet he does not know anything in reality. The poverty that I am speaking of does not relate to the absence of knowledge, but rather to the inadequacy and superficiality of one's knowledge.</p><p>It is easy to know whether or not we do have something. But very few people are aware of whether they live in a condition of poverty, because poverty is something that cannot be objectively quantified. A rich man in the rural countryside becomes poor in comparison when he comes to Shanghai, and he will be even poorer when he comes to New York City. All those who are blind think that they are rich. When I was a child, whenever I had ten dollars, I would exchange them for a great deal of coins. Although I only had ten dollars, I felt that I was the richest person in the world. We can know what we have, but it is difficult for us to know that what we have is not enough! I have seen many different kinds of people, and I have drawn the same conclusion: Most of the ones who think that they are rich are actually poor.</p><p>A few days ago I was talking to a brother about obedience. He told me that during the past twelve years, he had obeyed God two or three times. When I heard this, I stood up and shouted, "Can someone like you know obedience?" Another time I was talking to a brother about the cross. Whenever I spoke, he would interrupt me. I would begin a sentence, and he would finish it. You might say that there was a wonderful "coordination," but during the conversation, I almost shouted, "Do you really know what the cross is?" Once I was talking to a man about the church. His words showed that he knew nothing about the church. I was talking to a sister about the subject of the kingdom six months ago, but she did not think that she was poor at all in this respect.</p><p>Tonight I choose to bring up this subject. I am not lecturing here; I am merely stating some facts. Most Christians today are cheap Christians. They bear a cheap cross, buy cheap obedience, and pursue a cheap kingdom. There is nothing wrong in being poor. However, when poverty joins itself to a proud person, the results are disastrous. The church in Laodicea was both poor and proud. She was poor, but she thought she was rich. This presumption is where the trouble lies. In spiritual matters those who think that they are rich are proud. Many Christians are proud, insubordinate, and troublesome because they have become full with their past experiences. These experiences have damaged them.</p><p>I have brought up the matter of the vessels in 2 Corinthians 4 and 2 Timothy 2. There is no question that we are a vessel, but the question before us is what kind of vessel we are and what material is used to build up the vessel. It is easy for us to see a vessel, but it is not easy for us to know the kind of material that makes up the vessel.</p><p>A good and honest brother from the north once questioned me repeatedly about the church. He wanted to know about the Body, the church life, and the Body life. Spiritual matters have to do with riches. They have nothing to do with how many questions one asks, but how deep the questions are. If a rich man stands next to you, you will become poor right away by comparison.</p><p>In 1920 I spent a great deal of time studying the coming of Christ. I thought that I could have had a Ph.D. in this subject. A year later I met Sister M. E. Barber. One afternoon, we were on this important subject, and we spent quite a few hours talking about it. By the end we were still not through with it. She wanted me to stay behind to talk about it some more, but I did not accept the offer. Before I left she said, "You hide your disagreements in your heart and launder your politeness out in the front." I admitted that what I knew concerning the Lord's coming was merely outward knowledge. I studied and researched His coming, but Sister Barber was a person who waited for His coming. I was an earthen vessel, while she was a vessel of gold and silver. She was rich, and I was poor.</p><p>One brother said that God had dealt with him once or twice, and that he now knew the growth of life. Actually he may still be ignorant of it. A baby grows very fast during the first years of his life, and others easily can see the growth. But after thirty years it is difficult to grow anymore. After thirty years it is no longer a matter of growth, but a matter of maturity.</p><p>The condition of the church in Laodicea was miserable and poor. Yet she thought that she was rich. God has no intention to change those who have not into those who have; He only wants to make those who are poor into those who are rich. I have heard Sister Barber and Brother Sparks speak. Both of them have the riches. During the past three or four years the shallow and superficial experiences have frustrated us. These experiences have hindered us from launching into deeper experiences. Laodicea's self-estimate was exactly the opposite of God's evaluation. If you are really rich, you should rejoice. But the pitiful thing is that you do not look like those who have something. In spiritual matters, those who are blind do not realize that they are poor; only those whose eyes have been opened realize that they have nothing. The most important thing for us to do today is to see. Once we see, we will no longer consider ourselves to be rich.</p><p>I have said to some co-workers that the messages they give now may be the same as the ones they gave years ago, but there is a deeper understanding of what they are speaking now. Sometimes when I look at some old magazines, I find some old articles that I have written. I cannot believe that I could have said what I said then. Today much of the terminology has become all too common and misused. Many people say that they have received revelation. Actually they do not know what revelation is. Those who are behind you spiritually will not benefit by what you have, while those who are ahead of you spiritually see through all your words. Once a blind man sees, the first thing he notices is his own nakedness. Just as Adam and Eve realized their nakedness in the garden of Eden, we see our nakedness when our eyes are opened. Our true condition is laid open before our God. It is difficult to preach the gospel to those who are already in the church. In the same principle it is difficult to give a message to those who already think that they are rich. The church in Smyrna considered herself poor, yet she was rich before the Lord.</p><p>What are riches? Riches are not a matter of having something. Being rich is realizing that we only have elementary experiences before the Lord. Human wisdom, verbal understanding, and pride have no place here. Those who are eloquent, who have a sharp memory, and who prepare their speeches well, are not necessarily the ones who are qualified to teach. Only those whose eyes have been opened by the Lord are qualified to speak. Every time we see something, we become conscious of our own nakedness. There is not one person whose eyes have been opened who has not seen his own nakedness. You can try this out for yourself when you go home tonight.</p><p>The first time we saw the truth in Romans 6, which reveals that our baptism into Christ is a baptism into His death, we were thrilled. But when we try to share what we have spoken of in the past, we realize that we have nothing to add. In fact, light does not add something to us; it tears down something. Once a man said that he knew the church. Later, he came back and said that he knew nothing about the church, because a greater light had swallowed up his former light. When you come to Shanghai, do not come with the thought that you will receive something. If you think in this way, you will go home as empty-handed as when you came. In spiritual matters what is needed is not knowledge. What is needed is a person who feels that he has never seen anything. Once a man sees, he will realize that he is naked. Some people think that all that is needed is some patch-up work, but this is not the way God operates. When light comes, everything of the past is torn down. When light comes, there is the stripping, and the stripping will take away everything. Light will shine to such an extent that a person will doubt whether he is saved. When light shines, a man will fall down like Saul and forget about his self-image and self-esteem.</p><p>Light will show us that we have nothing, that we are empty. It will bring us to the point where we feel that we have nothing except our initial salvation. When light comes, we will realize that we really do not know anything. If we think that we know this and that, and if we think that we know a little about everything, we will never be rich. The way to riches is not through accumulation but through destitution. Some people seem to know a little about everything, yet they can never carry on an in-depth discussion about anything. God's house is rich, but earthen and wooden vessels have no place in His house. Grass and wood are not the proper materials to build His house. God's house can only be built with precious materials. We have to come under God's light, and we have to realize that God's house is so rich that there is no room for all the riches. We should not hold on to the little that we have. Instead, we should see that there are riches in God's house. We should always receive something more, and we should always act as if we have not received anything.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING GOD'S THINGS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Col. 3:4, 11; John 8:24, 28</h1><p>If all that a Christian knows is that he has embraced the Christian faith and that this is a noble thing to do, I do not believe that such a person can go on in a good way. This thought may be noble, but only in a negative sense. What we need is light in a positive sense.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST OUR LIFE</h2><p>A Christian who does not know that Christ is his life does not know what reality is. Unless a man receives God's light and sees the things in Christ, he is like a blind man who is oblivious to all the physical objects around him. Those in the world only know the things of the world, and we call them the unbelievers. But if a Christian only knows the "things" in Christ, such as love, work, virtues, etc., he will still be short of God's standard. These things resemble Christ and are actually very close to Christ, but they are merely things. Too few Christians today are after Christ Himself. Most of them are after the things of Christ. These things have filled their whole being. However, many other Christians can testify from their own experience that the things they once treasured have turned out to be nothing but dead "things."</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE THINGS THAT<br />CHRISTIANS CONSIDER IMPORTANT</h2><p>There are certain things that Christians consider very important. Without these things, they seem to feel that they can no longer be Christians. If you remove these things from them, they will feel that they are no longer Christians. They will feel very strange when a person calls himself a Christian yet does not have these things.</p><h2 class="head2">Experience</h2><p>There are two kinds of Christian experiences. Some experiences are Christ, while other experiences are things. With the latter, you cannot say that Christ is not in the experience, but neither can you say that Christ is the experience. Many experiences begin as Christ but end up as things. Many experiences are part Christ and part things. The same is true with many works and behaviors&mdash;they are part Christ and part things. How can one say that an experience is all Christ, without any trace of "things"? Many experiences of Christ were real the first time a person experienced them; they were living, but they have become dead.</p><p>In the eyes of the Lord experience should not be limited by time. There is no past tense in spiritual things. Some testify, saying, "On such-and-such a date, the Lord led me a certain way, and I experienced certain things." If you check with them again whether or not they really had such an experience on that certain date, they confidently say "yes." But those who testify about their own experience are only testifying about things; they are not testifying about Christ. These things might have been Christ at the time they experienced them, but they have become things. In our testimony, we should say, "On such-and-such a date, I experienced Christ for the first time." This means that we have continued to experience Christ. When some people testify about their salvation, they feel they have the Lord's presence. Yet they are only testifying about a thing or an event.</p><p>Many people come to us with a hope. They see others receiving a revelation, and they hope to have the same. Eventually, they become disappointed. Those who hope to find do not find, because their hope rests on a thing. The Lord does not give us things. He does not intend to give man merely things. Many people do not ask for the Lord Himself; they merely ask the Lord to do something for them. When the thing is done, the Lord is set aside. They want the Lord to visit them and give them the things that are spoken of in others' testimonies. They want the experiences for the sake of giving good testimonies, not for the sake of gaining Christ.</p><p>Only those who seek after the Lord alone will see; those who seek for experience will not see. In fact, only those who seek after the Lord will have the experience; those who seek after the experience will not find it. Those who seek after the Lord will have the experience of Romans 6; those who seek for the experience of Romans 6 will not find it. They may be able to speak and pray about it, but they will not have the experience of it.</p><h2 class="head2">Gifts</h2><p>Many Christians feel ashamed of themselves because they do not have many gifts. It is true that some have profound wisdom, quick mentality, power, eloquence, or great faith. But are these things Christ? There is a big difference between gifts and Christ.</p><p>I was once proud of my own wisdom. I thought that I was wiser than others. At that time I was living in darkness, the same as some of you are. Like Paul, I could say, "I advanced...beyond many contemporaries" (Gal. 1:14). Today I realize how foolish and shameful I was. At that time, however, I considered myself wonderful and sincere. I even believed that my advancement was real. When I first became a Christian, I spent a great deal of time in the Word. Once I read Andrew Murray's book, The Spirit of Christ, and I was so attracted by it that I did not want to eat or sleep. I just wanted to read on; I could not put it down. Later, I read Philippians 3:3, which says to "serve by the Spirit of God." I cannot quote the verse verbatim tonight, but the power of this word still remains with me today. Someone can understand the teaching of Philippians 3:3 and pass it on to others. But when I read it, I asked myself, "Am I reading this, or is it Christ who is reading this?" That night, for the first time, I experienced an aversion for "things." I was not grasping on to Christ, but to things. Up to that point it had been only a teaching, a kind of research; it was not Christ.</p><p>In spiritual matters it is very easy to have spiritual "things" without having Christ. This is the greatest work of Satan. When something becomes a thing or an object, it becomes dead. Today there are many works, testimonies, and studies that can only be considered as things, not Christ. It is not easy to replace Christ with ornaments and physical objects, but it is very easy to replace Him with experiences, gifts, and works.</p><p>A few weeks ago, someone asked me, "What is your opinion concerning miraculous things?" To tell you the truth, I have not seen many miraculous things. But when I have seen them, there has been very little of Christ in those things. Many people pride themselves in these things. They advertise these things and regard them as necessary for their power and recognition. Little do they realize that they are merely things. I am not against anyone having these things. But like Paul, I would say, "Moreover I show to you a most excellent way" (1 Cor. 12:31).</p><p>In 1926 I intended to work in a certain place. I felt that I should not go, but I went anyway. I could not say that I was rebelling against the Lord, but neither could I say that I was obeying Him. I did not find peace and could not pray. I could only utter some formal prayers and read the Word in a ritualistic way. The result of the work was good and many people were saved, but I was grieving. It was Sister Barber's wish that I not leave Foochow, but when someone wrote to her and told her of the result of the work, she commended me for the first time. However, I still did not feel at ease. I was working by the gifts that God had given me; I considered these gifts as things. They were merely things and not Christ. Today I can say that my gift is just Christ. This gift is a person. If I am related to the gifts without being related to Christ, the gifts will only be things. Although the Corinthian believers had gifts, their gifts were dead because Christ was not there.</p><p>Once light comes, everything is stripped away. Everyone treasures and boasts in the gifts. When a man has some gifts, he often thinks that he is better than others. When we have light, we will see that our gift and power are nothing but Christ. The very empowering strength is Christ. This is not just a slogan; it has to be a genuine seeing. Real gifts are not things; they are Christ Himself.</p><h2 class="head2">Daily Walk&mdash;Prayer and the Study of the Word</h2><p>Prayer and the study of the Word are two common aspects of the daily walk of a Christian. But to many, these two things are just things. The day I read Andrew Murray's book, I asked myself, "Is your Bible reading Christ or is it merely a thing? Are your many prayers Christ or are they things?" If something has no life, it remains a thing. All that we struggle to do apart from Christ and all that we accomplish without contacting Christ are merely things. God may not want us to know a great deal of knowledge, or He may not want us to know it yet. But many of us have a lust for knowledge. We want to know the answers to all the problems in the Bible. If we cannot solve these problems, we cannot sleep or eat. Many of us engage in studies against our inner guidance. Others may not know if we are touching things or touching Christ, but we know.</p><p>When the disciples went to fish, they labored for the whole night without success. When the morning broke, Someone asked if they had anything to eat and told them to cast their net on the right side of the boat. At that very moment they knew that it was the Lord. Touching the Lord is very different from touching things. Things are rigid, dead, cold, and outward; they cannot touch a person.</p><p>The church can never be cheated. Although many young believers cannot articulate a point with their mouth, they know inwardly and can tell if something is Christ or just a thing. I am not saying that Bible reading is unnecessary. I am saying that all the spiritual things spoken of in the Bible are just Christ. Every thing that is apart from Christ is not Christ; it is merely a thing.</p><h2 class="head2">Work</h2><p>Every Christian, whether or not he is a worker, should have his own work in the church. Brother Austin-Sparks used to say, "We can never say if our work is of the Lord, nor can we say how much of our work is of the Lord and how much of it is of ourselves. We know only after the work has left our hand." I heard this remark from him seven or eight times during the year I stayed in London. I believe this word. When a work is no longer in our hand and others criticize it as being not of the Lord, we will feel unhappy, discontented, or uncomfortable. This proves that the work was a thing, not Christ. God is not after our work, but after Christ. One day our work will go away, but Christ will remain.</p><p>Paul intended to preach in Asia, but the Holy Spirit forbade him. This was recorded in the Acts of the Apostles (16:6). But it was really the non-acts, rather than the acts of the apostles, that were recorded. Our obedience to the Lord depends more on what we do not do than it does on what we do. In fact much of man's "inactivity" is God's very "activity."</p><p>The church should realize that all things are in Christ. I like the word in Luke 17:7-8: "But which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will...not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me." Plowing is a work to gain the outsiders, whereas tending sheep is a work to take care of the insiders. Many people pay attention only to the first two works and neglect to "serve me." This service is our service to the Lord apart from our work. A day will come when the Lord will show us how vain and shameful our work has been. We have been laboring on things only. We have been taking care of the business of the church, but we have not been serving Christ. This is a very positive light.</p><h2 class="head2">Behavior</h2><p>For many Christians behavior is a thing. Their humility, meekness, and zeal are nothing but performances. However, God wants to show us that the very characteristic of Christianity is just Christ. Yet we give others the impression that the characteristic of Christianity is things. All of the virtues are good and necessary, yet Paul did not pursue after the knowledge of virtues but the knowledge of Christ. Christ is the unique virtue.</p><p>All religions are the same, and they are good. But they only touch the virtues, the things, and not Christ. They touch our conduct, goodness, love, diligence, sacrifice, and suffering for others. However, God is after Christ. All He wants is for Christ to do all of the work within us. He does not care about what we do or what we can do. If we do not see ourselves in a thorough way, we do not see the Lord. The real behavior is the Lord working in us. It is the Lord who is loving in us, the Lord who is humble in us, and the Lord who is meek in us. Everything is the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST'S NAME BEING "I AM"</h2><p>The Lord said that His name is "I AM." No other name in the Old Testament is greater than this name&mdash;"I AM" (Exo. 3:14). Is the Lord the "I AM" in this and that matter? This is the crux of the issue. In everything we have to ask: Is this the Lord? Two thousand years of Christianity have shown us that everything that is not Christ will go away. True Chris- tianity is just Christ. Is Christ our power? Is Christ our love? Is Christ our meekness? Many people can only say that Christ gives them power, love, and meekness. But I will tell you that Christ can do something deeper than this. He will not only give you power, love, and meekness, He will be everything to you. Only those who take Christ as everything in this way can say, "Christ our life" (Col. 3:4). Many people can recite this verse, but we need a new beginning today. We need to not only recite this verse, but to live out this verse.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, these words are feeble, ineffective, and ordinary. Many are familiar with them already. May You speak to us personally and accomplish what no man can accomplish. Just as the Israelites left Egypt once and for all, give us a vision and deliver us from all the substitutes once and for all. Lord, may there be nothing in us that would replace You. All we can do is imitate You, but these imitations are not You. Open up the meaning of the words "Christ our life" to us. Many of us need to be torn down before we can be built up. May we find Christ everywhere. We can say this, but we often do not see it from deep within. May this matter be deeply rooted in us so that we will not see it just once, but all the time. May we find Christ everywhere, and may Christ be our all because He is all and in all. May we testify that Christ is indeed everything in the church. May Christ be everything to many of us. May Christ be all of our things, and may we take the lead to experience Christ as the One who is all and in all. In Your name we pray, amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">SERVING GOD IN HOLINESS<br />AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 13, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Luke 1:75</h1><h2 class="head1">THE STARTING POINT OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>A Christian should have many memorable dates written in his Bible. If he does not have many dates written in it, he will be like a calendar without dates. The history of God's creation is recorded in the Bible. In the same way the history of your new creation should be recorded there. Every Christian at least should have a date of salvation, a date of baptism, a date when he received the laying on of hands, and a date when he consecrated himself to the Lord. A Christian at least should have two beginnings&mdash;salvation and consecration. Every Christian should have a date when he was saved and when he consecrated himself to the Lord. If a man does not have a date of consecration, he is like someone without a date of salvation in the eyes of God. A train needs two tracks before it can run. In the same way a Christian must not only be saved but must be consecrated. Those who are saved but not consecrated are not running a proper race. Everyone in the world should be saved, and every saved person should be consecrated. After one goes through these two experiences, he has a proper beginning. A Christian who has never consecrated himself is not advancing at all; he has not taken the first step on his spiritual journey. Only after a person has passed through these two experiences can he begin his spiritual journey.</p><h2 class="head1">SERVING GOD IN HOLINESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>A saved and consecrated person serves the Lord. Concerning our service to God, Luke 1:74-75 says, "Serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness." Holiness has to do with ourselves, whereas righteousness has to do with others. Holiness is for God, and it is a gift, whereas righteousness is acquired, and it is an expression. Holiness is a nature, and righteousness is a habit. Holiness is a life, and righteousness is a way. The Lord Jesus said, "I am the way...and the life" (John 14:6). Our life is holy, whereas our way is righteous. Life is in us, whereas the way is to be extended to others. After we have the life of holiness within, we still need a righteous living without. An outward, righteous living must be matched by an inward, holy life. A Christian can be very righteous, but unless he is also holy, his righteousness will not last. Holiness and righteousness refer to two aspects&mdash;inward and outward&mdash;which are indispensable. We have to serve God in holiness and righteousness. Tonight we will cover the matter of righteousness first. Righteousness refers to the way we deal with people and things.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH UNRIGHTEOUSNESSES</h2><p>An unsaved person lives an unrighteous life. He does not feel it. In fact, he may feel that he is quite good. But once a person believes in the Lord, he receives God's holy life into him, and he begins to deal with unrighteousness and to live a righteous life. He will allow righteousness to become a habitual, organic, and spontaneous thing in him. Are we righteous in the way we deal with people and things in our daily life? Have we collected something that we should not have collected? Have we paid what we should have paid? Have we taken something that we should not have taken? We must be right and righteous in all things. All righteous behavior is the result of the operation of the holy life and nature within.</p><p>Let me relate an old story to you. Three years after I was saved, I began to practice being righteous. However, I still did not know much about righteousness itself. One day I read an article in a magazine about a convention. At the convention one preacher was sitting away from the stage. When it was his turn to speak, he walked past someone and stepped on that person's raincoat. He did not apologize. When I read this, it occurred to me that this was wrong and unrighteous. The preacher did not have the right to step on the raincoat; it was unrighteous. After I received this light, I was enlightened as to how I should deal with unrighteousness.</p><p>There are many unrighteous things around us. Unrighteousness can be found in the way we deal with our money, attitude, time, responsibility, material possessions, and many other things. The pursuit of righteousness is an excellent exercise. The light of the Holy Spirit is like the ray of the sun, and we are like the glass in a window. If the glass is covered with dust, it will not be transparent. The problem is not with the shining of the sun but with the transparency of the glass. In the same way the problem is not with the light of the Spirit but with the shining within us. Our pursuit of righteousness is like cleaning the window; it makes us transparent and keeps us in the shining of the Spirit. In this way spiritually we become sensitive enough to live a righteous living.</p><p>There was an old lady in Shanghai who had been a Christian for thirty years. However, her living was a mess; she was still living unrighteously. One day I felt compelled to ask, "Have you ever apologized to anyone in your whole life?" She answered in Shanghainese: "Thank heaven! No." She did not receive any shining; she was as insensitive as she had always been. If you blow smoke into a man's eyes or pour water into his nose, he will react because he is a living person and because he is sensitive to these things. But if he is dead, he will not feel anything. When we act unrighteously, the greatest rebuke comes from within us.</p><h2 class="head2">In Money</h2><p>The first unrighteous thing we have to deal with is money. Money easily brings us into unrighteousness. We cannot take someone else's money as our own. Not a cent of others' money can be ours, and we cannot borrow (that is, personal borrowing, not borrowing in business). With some people, borrowing is a habit. It is like drugs to them; they are addicted to it. Time and again they borrow. If you want to be a brother to them, you should not lend anything to them. If you lend to them, you should be ready to sacrifice your relationship with them. Borrowing and lending is a great temptation; they lead to unrighteousness. When others transgress against us, we can be compensated by God. But if we transgress against others, we will not receive blessing from God. We cannot be careless in the matter of money.</p><p>There was a maid who stole over twenty dollars from her master before she was saved. After she was saved, she felt sorry and said to a sister, "I feel uneasy about keeping this money. I would like to offer it to God." When the sister heard this, she asked, "How do you know that God will take your booty?" She told the maid to return the money to her master. The maid agreed, and when she did this, she became peaceful. Another sister was asked by her sister in the flesh to let her use her admittance ticket to the park. She did not want to do it, but eventually she gave in. After she gave in, she lost her peace. A brother was taking a tram to Wen-teh Lane. The fare was seven cents, but he got off before he paid the fare. Later, he was condemned about this. It is not easy to be righteous. I told that brother that the next time he took the tram he should buy two tickets to make up for the previous trip.</p><p>If you have any unrighteous money remaining in your home, it will eat up the rest of your money and even eat up your spiritual life. It is all right to bargain when you shop, but do not try to cheat on the scale and do not hope that the arm on the scale will tip over more. Righteousness has nothing to do with whether or not others are willing to give us a bargain; it has to do with whether or not we are willing to accept a bargain. A missionary, Miss Liu, once took a summer vacation in the Lu Mountains. While she was there, someone tried to sell her bamboo baskets. She began to bargain with the man. At a certain point she could bargain no further, because she felt that it was no longer a matter of the man's willingness to sell, but a matter of the fairness of the price. Many people are only reluctantly willing; theirs is not a heartfelt willingness.</p><h2 class="head2">In Time</h2><p>We should not take advantage of others in time. We should render to others whatever time we owe them. It is unrighteous for us to steal others' time for our own use. Many people know that they should not steal money to offer to God, but they steal time to offer to God. This is also unrighteousness. We should deal with any unrighteousness in the use of our time.</p><h2 class="head2">In Responsibility</h2><p>We should also be righteous in bearing our responsibility. Some fathers are busy doing their own work. They have no time to be fathers. Their sons are deprived of the fatherly love they need. Likewise, many mothers have often been unrighteous in neglecting their responsibilities. Some mothers say that they want to be spiritual, and they do not need to care so much about their children. They say that they are committing everything to the Lord and leaving it up to the Lord to discipline the children. This is unrighteousness. A husband has his responsibility as a husband. If a husband does not take up the financial responsibility of the family, he is being unrighteous. A wife has to bear the responsibility of the housework or else she is unrighteous. Every person has his or her area of responsibility. You have your sphere; I cannot decide what it is. But you know when you infringe on others' sphere or when you become unfaithful in your own. We have to learn to be a righteous person in our responsibilities.</p><h2 class="head1">DEVELOPING A HABIT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>We should render to others whatever is due to them. If we do not render it to them, we are being unrighteous. We should discover new items of unrighteousness every day in our daily life and deal with them accordingly. We may commit some accidental unrighteous acts, but we have to learn to discover them and deal with them also. For example, we know that we should not trespass on lawns. But many people trespass inadvertently. We have to deal with such unrighteousness. Righteousness is a habit which we have to cultivate; it is a way that we have to take. We have to learn to deny all looseness and unrighteousnesses. If we do this we will spontaneously live out righteousness.</p><p>We should learn to be a righteous person, but we should not try to intentionally act this out. Sometimes others can be turned off by our righteousness. Tonight we have to settle our account before the Lord. We have to discover all of our unrighteousnesses and learn to deal with them one by one. We should receive God's shining and refuse Satan's condemnation. Sometimes unrighteous things flash before our eyes from all angles. Some are real and some are counterfeits. Satan tries to show us these things in an instant to crush us. This is his snare; it is not God's work, and we have to reject it. God's work is gradual; it works step by step. God enlightens us gradually; He guides us to deal with things one by one with the goal of developing a habit of righteousness, of learning to take the way of righteousness according to the holy life, and of serving Him in holiness and righteousness.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">A TALK WITH NEW BELIEVERS<br />ON CONSECRATION</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 13, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1; 14:7-9; 1 Cor. 6:19-20; 2 Cor. 5:14-15; Exo. 12:29; 13:1-2; 32:26; Num. 3:44-45</h1><p>Redemption is a great event in the universe, whereas consecration is a great thing for a Christian. While redemption is God's great act, consecration should be our great act. If I asked, "Is redemption a great thing in the universe?", you will surely say yes. Redemption is indeed a crucial thing, but consecration is just as crucial as redemption. In fact, the goal of redemption is achieved through consecration. Redemption recovers God's lost authority in man, while consecration returns God's lost authority and position in man back to God. Hence, we can say that redemption and consecration are two sides of the same thing. No one can be a proper Christian without consecrating himself to the Lord. It is vain to exhort, encourage, or inspire others to consecrate themselves. Unless a man sees the basis of consecration, he cannot consecrate himself. Once a man sees the basis of consecration, it becomes very spontaneous for him to consecrate himself to the Lord. Only those who have seen the basis of consecration will consecrate themselves to the Lord in a thorough way.</p><p>Paul was very clear concerning the basis of consecration. His consecration was an answer to God's compassion. Chapters one through eight of Romans are on redemption. Chapters nine through eleven are parenthetical words; the nation of Israel is presented as an illustration. Following this, chapter twelve speaks of consecration. The basis of consecration is redemption. First there is redemption, and then there is consecration. First Corinthians 6:19-20 says, "Do you not know that...you are not your own? For you have been bought with a price. So then glorify God in your body." Redemption is the reason and the cause for consecration. Second Corinthians 5:14-15 says, "For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised." These verses say that since the Lord has died for us, we should live to Him. When we see His redemption, we offer up our consecration. We must show others what redemption is before we can talk to them about consecration.</p><p>If a man has not seen redemption, his consecration will be temporary and baseless. If a man does not see redemption, he cannot consecrate himself. Even if he has consecrated himself, his consecration will not be thorough. What is redemption? Redemption is the greatest subject in the eyes of God. It recovers God's lost right. In God's eyes this world is not only sinful, but lost. Luke 15 does not say that there were a hundred sheep and that one lost its temper; rather, it says that one was lost and missing. It does not say that a woman had ten silver coins and that one became rusty. It says that one was lost. In the parable of the prodigal son, it says that the prodigal son was lost and was as good as dead. In God's eyes, when man sinned and fell, He lost something.</p><p>Christians are God's inheritance. God created the universe with the intention that Christ would be the Head over all things and that all things would be made subject to Him. But a tragedy happened&mdash;man sinned and fell. The man that God created became lost; he became someone else's possession. This was a tragedy to God. Would you not feel grieved if your hard-earned monthly salary fell into someone else's hand and was lost? The same is true with God. His greatest grief is His loss of man.</p><p>Man's sins are a secondary issue. The main issue is that God lost something. The prodigal son may have made money or squandered money, but he remained a prodigal. Others may have found him to be a good man, even a gentleman, but they would still have to say that he was a lost man. This shows us that the primary goal of redemption does not concern the issue of sin. This is like a watch being pawned to the pawn shop and remaining there for three years. During the three years, the owner of the watch has lost his right to the watch. On man's side redemption means the forgiveness of sins, while on God's side it means God gains something back. Sal- vation is for man to gain something, whereas redemption is for God to gain something. Redemption brings back to God what He had lost in Eden. Redemption also tells us that henceforth we belong to God. Originally, man belonged to God. Later, he belonged to someone else. Now God is redeeming man and recovering him.</p><p>Since redemption means the recovery of man back to God, the matter of consecration immediately follows. Consecration is man's acknowledgement of God's right in him. It is the acknowledgement of God's place in the universe. There are three passages in the Old Testament which provide an understanding of consecration: Exodus 12&mdash;13, Exodus 32, and Numbers 8. Exodus 12&mdash;13 provides the most complete type of redemption. On the night of the Passover, all the firstborn were killed. At that time the Israelites were slaves under the domination of foreigners. They cried out as a result of their suffering, and their cry reached God. God cared for them and promised to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians. He said that the Israelites were His people, while Pharaoh said that they were his people. God wanted the Israelites to serve Him in the wilderness, but Pharaoh wanted to keep them in Egypt to make bricks and build cities for him. The controversy between God and Pharaoh was centered around to whom the Israelites belonged. It was not a matter of whether or not the Israelites were going to heaven; it was a matter of to whom the Israelites belonged.</p><p>Redemption speaks of the great controversy between God and Satan. God used all the firstborn as a type of the whole family, because the firstborn is born at the height of a man's strength. For God to kill the firstborn means that everyone is to be killed. All those who are lost to God have only one end&mdash;death. Redemption is God's act of recovering the fallen ones from Satan's hand. Redemption is for God to gain something, whereas salvation is for us to gain something. Because we need salvation, redemption comes. The way of redemption is through the cross. As the Lamb of God, the Lord Jesus bore the sins of the world. He shed His blood on the cross. This is typified by the blood of the lamb in the Old Testament.</p><p>In Exodus 13:2 the Lord said, "Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine." All the firstborn were to be sanctified unto the Lord. I do not believe that a person who has truly seen redemption can remain unconsecrated. This is impossible. Many Christians only know what it means to be saved; they do not know what it means to be redeemed. Many children of God only know salvation; they do not know redemption. Salvation secures blessings for man but has no reference to God's right or to man's position before God. Salvation is related to us personally. In God's eyes, we have gained something. If we look at ourselves, we see that we are saved. But if we were taken away in a trance to God's throne like Paul was, and if we looked at the matter from God's point of view, we would see that we are not only saved but also redeemed. Spontaneously, we would consecrate ourselves and say, "I can no longer live unto myself."</p><p>In 2 Corinthians 5:14 Paul said, "For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died." The word judged in Greek means "carefully considered." Salvation addresses the matter of who is living, whereas redemption addresses the matter of to whom one is living. Salvation looks at the matter from man's side, whereas redemption looks at the matter from God's side. All the saved ones are also redeemed ones because salvation is based on redemption. Without God's redemption, there can be no salvation for man.</p><p>Consecration is an unknown topic to many people. Actually, it is a simple thing. Consecration is not man doing many things for God. A man can do many things for God without being consecrated. It has nothing to do with whether or not we will be preachers for the Lord. It has to do with our ownership; to whom do you belong? To whom are you living? Many people struggle and strive for their own preferences because they have not seen the meaning of redemption. If we do not see that redemption settles the matter of the Lord's ownership of us, and if we only pay attention to outward works, we will find that it is hard to go on. We should not try to tackle this problem in ourselves. We need light from God to see the meaning of redemption. Once we see it, we will consecrate ourselves spontaneously. Many people think that consecration is a difficult and insurmountable thing. But Paul said, "Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service" (Rom. 12:1). He considered and concluded that consecration was the most reasonable and sensible thing to do.</p><p>A consecrated person is one who kneels under the cross and at the same time stands by the throne. He kneels under the cross to receive salvation, and his view from the throne constrains him to consecrate himself. Those with a sensitive conscience consecrate themselves as a gesture of gratitude for their salvation, while those whose conscience is not as exercised do not consecrate. But no matter how we feel and no matter what kind of conscience we have, we have to realize that consecration is not something that we can muster up. Consecration is based on light; we need to consider the matter from the point of view of the throne. Knowing a doctrine and seeing revelation are two different things. Many people know the doctrine, theology, and teaching of redemption, but they do not have the revelation of redemption. Exodus 12 tells us that God smote the firstborn of the whole land of Egypt, but redeemed the firstborn of the household of Israel. This shows that all the redeemed ones belong to God.</p><p>Redemption signifies a change in right. God delivered those who were under Satan's hand into His hand. Does this mean that all of the Israelites belonged to God? The firstborn of Israel were only taken as representatives. All of the children of Israel should have been God's, but the history of Israel shows that not all the firstborn belonged to Him. Most of them did not want God, and God put them aside. In Exodus 13:2 all the firstborn belonged to God. But Numbers 8:18 says, "And I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel." Only the Levites could participate in the services after God's tabernacle was erected. Why was it only the Levites? While Moses was on Mount Sinai, the people worshipped the golden calf under the mountain. When Moses heard this, he declared, "Who is on the Lord's side? let him come unto me" (Exo. 32:26). At that word the sons of Levi came to him. All the Israelites were redeemed, but only the Levi stood up to declare that they were the Lord's. Numbers 8:18 tells us that God chose the Levites to replace the firstborn of Israel. Exodus 12 and 13 speak of the whole nation of Israel being redeemed. All of them received salvation and redemption. In Exodus 32 they murmured against God and did not believe that He would lead them into the promised land. As a result God chose from among them the Levites. Here the Levites signify consecration. They took the place of the firstborn among the Israelites to serve God.</p><p>What is consecration? It is coming out of your own house and your own tribe to stand on Moses' side and declare, "I am on the Lord's side."</p><p>There is a definite date when we are saved. In the same way, there has to be a definite date when we are consecrated. Just as salvation should not be delayed, our consecration should not be delayed. At the time of Moses, the Levites stood up in an absolute way on his side and declared, "We are on the Lord's side." Tonight you should declare that you belong to the Lord and that you are consecrating yourself to Him. Tonight may some declare, "I belong to the Lord. I am a consecrated one." If you consecrate yourself to the Lord this way, you will be like the Levites who came out of their own house and their own tribe.</p><p>If you consecrate yourself to the Lord this way, you will have to rise up to kill (Exo. 32:27). Your husband, brothers, friends, and those whom who love should have the mark of the sword on them. You should be like the Levites, who put the swords by their sides and went in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, slaying every man his brother, companion, and neighbor. The sword of a consecrated one is turned outward to kill. Those who are consecrated cannot be afraid of hurting others. Of course, while the killing is done on others, the real hurt is in one's own flesh. When a consecrated one draws his sword to kill, the real hurt is to himself.</p><p>I am not saying that you have to do this by yourself. I am saying that if a man lives in the light and if his eyes are opened to redemption, he will behave this way spontaneously. Romans 12:1 says, "Present your bodies a living sacrifice." This presenting has to be done by yourself. Those who are consecrated to the Lord are living sacrifices on the altar. This means that when a consecrated one rises up to kill, the hurt of the sword is felt by him, even though he puts his sword on his brother or his neighbor. The sword is applied to others, but the hurt is in himself. A consecrated person can rise up to slaughter things, events, and people because he has first been slaughtered. If a man has never passed through the cross, he cannot live the consecrated life. Tonight may some pray, "Lord! You have purchased me. Because of this, I consecrate everything to You. Because of Your redemption, I am willing to be killed, burned, and removed." Such a heart will cut off all fleshly activities. Only such "Levites" can become the real firstborn.</p><p>In order to have the Passover, the lamb must be killed. The killing in this case refers to Christ's death. But the killing of the Levites refers to our death. The first killing secures our salvation, while the second killing fulfills the true meaning of redemption. A genuinely consecrated person is one who chooses to be one of God's people and who stands on His side. Only those who will draw their swords to kill are qualified to be God's genuine people. Being part of God's people is something common, but drawing one's sword to kill is not common. We can divide the world into two classes of people: those who are saved and those who are unsaved. We can also divide the church into two classes of people: those who are consecrated and those who are not willing to be consecrated. May we, by the mercy of the Lord, be those who are consecrated.</p><p>I hope the message tonight will open our eyes to see that a redeemed person must consecrate himself. Those who want to consecrate themselves must know the real significance of redemption. Only the consecrated ones can serve. Service is the result of consecration. May the Lord drive away any fear in the matter of our consecration so that we may not lose the Lord's sovereign rights on us through our fear of this and that kind of thing.</p><p>Prayer: May those who hear this word say when they return home that consecration is the only way to serve You. Show us that service is the result of consecration. Do not allow us to have any fear in this regard and do not allow us to sacrifice Your sovereign rights in us. Grant us to be the real Levites, standing on God's side. Give us the sword to kill all the things that are not of God. May we not care for human affections, ourselves, or anything. May these feeble words produce some effect in us. In Your victorious name we pray, amen!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S WILL AND THE LORD'S WILL</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Saturday evening, December 14, 1940<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1-2; John 15:7; 1 Cor. 10:27; Acts 16:3, 6-7, 18; 17:16-17; 20:16</h1><h2 class="head1">GOD'S WILL BEING DIFFERENT<br />FROM THE LORD'S WILL</h2><p>Every Christian should know God's will. If a Christian does not know His will, he is still in darkness. John 12:46 says, "Every one who believes into Me would not remain in darkness." John 8:12 says, "He who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness." This means that all those who believe into the Lord and who follow Him will surely have light. They will surely see and know. Putting it another way, if a man does not have any light or if he does not see or know, he has a problem in following the Lord.</p><p>God's will is different from the Lord's will. God's will is objective; it is outside of man and has to do with God. The Lord's will is subjective; it is inside a Christian. Because God's will is objective and rests in God's throne, it is something mysterious to a Christian, and there is the need to seek after it. In order to know God's will, one has to drop his own will and reject the activities of the flesh.</p><p>At the same time, we have to realize that we know and understand very little concerning God's will in our daily life. If a man can say that he knew God's will fifty times in a year, he is very good. In many cases one cannot name ten times when he has known God's will.</p><p>God's will is often reflected through man's will. In John 15:7 the Lord said, "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you." The word "will" is an active kind of will in Greek. It is not a passive will. Both English and Greek use this word as a verb. It means for the will to make a decision. If our will actively wants something or asks for something, it will be done for us. This wanting is a very strong wanting. If we want something, all we have to do is to exercise our will to pray for it, and it will be done. This verse appears to pose a danger, because what would happen if what we will does not match God's will? We may be very careful when we read this verse and may even want to add a footnote, saying, "If something is according to God's will, and you actively will and ask for it, it shall be done for you." However, this is our concept; this is not the Lord's thought. The Lord said, "Whatever you will." The Lord believes that the will of some people is according to God's will.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN'S WISH</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 10:27 Paul said the same thing: "If any of the unbelievers invites you and you wish to go, eat everything that is set before you, asking no question for conscience' sake." It is strange that Paul did not tell us to pray to find out if we should go, or to pray to find out if we should eat. Paul did not mention God's will; he only mentioned man's wish. He only paid attention to the human will.</p><h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN THE LORD</h2><p>In John 15:7 the Lord Jesus said, "If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you." This word was directed at those who are in Christ, in whom Christ lives, and who are genuinely regenerated and consecrated. When a believer has the Lord's heart and is one with Him, he will experience this word.</p><p>The words in 1 Corinthians 10:27 and John 15:7 are not for everyone. They do not mean that anyone can wish what he wants and God will accomplish it for him. This word is for Christians who are in Christ, who are genuinely regenerated and consecrated, who have the mind of Christ, who receive the dealing of the cross, who abide in the Lord, and in whom the Lord's word abides.</p><p>We have said that God's will is objective while the Lord's will is subjective. God's will is on the throne, while the Lord's will is in the heart of Christians. God's will is outside a Christian, and he has to seek to know it. The Lord's will is inside a Christian, and it is waiting to manifest itself. God's will is countable; it can be a few wills or a few dozen wills. The Lord's will is continuous; it is continuously unveiled to us.</p><p>As soon as a man is regenerated, God's life enters into him and he becomes one with the Lord. Once the Lord's life enters a Christian, His will also enters into him. He will love what the Lord loves and hate what the Lord hates. The Lord's will becomes his will. To some the word of God is living, but to others it is dead.</p><p>Some may ask, "If this is the case, is not God's will too simple? Should we not spend more time to pray and to seek for His will?" Many people think that all they need is to spend more time to pray. But often the more they pray, the more confused they become. In the end they become cold and depressed. Actually, this need not be the case. If we are one with the Lord, we will want what the Lord wants; our will will become the Lord's will. Of course, this means that we must be proper persons.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE</h2><p>When a person is one with the Lord, his will becomes the Lord's will. If something is not according to God's will, the Holy Spirit will intervene and give him a feeling of unrest. If he does not stop, but insists on doing what he wants to do, he will feel ill at ease and not have any peace. God often guides a Christian by his own deliberations and will. For example, a brother or a sister may invite you to a certain place. You may feel cold inside. Although you want to go, you know very well within that you cannot go. This is God's will being manifested through your will.</p><h2 class="head1">PAUL'S EXPERIENCE</h2><p>Consider Paul's experience in Acts. When he went to Lystra, he met a disciple called Timothy, whose mother was a Jewish believer and whose father was a Greek. All the brothers in Lystra and Iconium recommended him, and Paul wanted to take him along. But because the Jews in that place knew that his father was a Greek, Paul circumcised him (16:1-3). Paul felt to circumcise Timothy, and he did it right away.</p><p>The same can be seen in Paul's experience in Philippi of casting out the spirit. A slave girl was possessed by a spirit, and followed Paul for many days, crying, "These men are slaves of the Most High God." Paul did not cast out the spirit immediately. The spirit was cast out when Paul wanted to cast it out. When Paul became provoked, he cast out the spirit, and the spirit left (vv. 16-18). Paul could have dealt with the spirit during the first few days, but there was no provocation within him. Once he was provoked within, the spirit was cast out. From this we see that the Christian walk should not be based on outward control, but on inward control.</p><p>The will of those who are truly consecrated reflects God's will. Paul was such a man. Acts 20:16 says, "For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus..." It does not say here that God decided but that Paul decided. We often hear Christians say, "God's will has led me here" or "God's will has led me to do this," but Paul did not use such spiritual expressions. His decision matched God's will. How do we know? We know because the result of his going to Ephesus was good. Paul feared God and was after His heart. Because of this his will became the manifestation of the Lord's will in him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FORBIDDING OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>But this does not mean that we will never be wrong when we walk according to our own will. Acts tells us that after Paul set out from Antioch for his evangelistic work, there were very few times when the Spirit led him to do something; most of the time the Spirit was forbidding him from doing something (16:6-7). Only in the vision of the night do we see the leading of the Spirit (v. 9). We must trust in the leading of the Spirit and also trust in the forbidding of the Spirit.</p><p>In conclusion we can see three things: (1) God's will, (2) the Lord's will, and (3) the forbidding of the Holy Spirit. Under normal circumstances, we know the Lord's will; through our union with the Lord, His will becomes our will. God's will is manifested only during special occasions. In addition, if something is not according to God's will, the Holy Spirit will intervene. If something is not according to God's will, we cannot force our decision or will through. This does not work. If something is not according to His will, we will not have the inward boldness to do it. God's will is positive, whereas the forbidding of the Spirit is negative. God's will is manifested in positive guidance, whereas the Holy Spirit's intervention is manifested in forbidding. In contrast, the Lord's will is both positive and negative.</p><h2 class="head1">A MAN IN WHOM GOD TRUSTS</h2><p>Romans 14 is an important chapter. Verse 23 says, "All that is not out of faith is sin." This is an important principle of the Christian life. The faith spoken of here is different from the faith spoken of in other parts of the Bible. In other places faith refers to the act of believing, such as: "Believe in the Lord Jesus" and "Believe in God's word." But in verse 23 this faith is not a believer's faith in God's word or in God Himself. It is the faith that believes in what he does himself. If he does things that are after God's heart, God will give him faith to assure him that he is right. If he does things that are not after God's heart, God will condemn him and show him that he is wrong. It is this faith that helps us to experience and understand God's will, and it is this faith that helps us to follow after the Lord's light and to live before His presence.</p><p>Some Christians have reached an advanced stage, and God can put His trust in them. They have passed through the cross and gone through the dealings. They are abiding in the Lord, and the Lord's word is abiding in them. As such, the Lord can trust in their will and in the proposals that come from their will. A brother from England once said, "A person who has passed through the cross does not take a passive role or wait for God's will in an outward way like many people do." If the Lord's life is living within us, His will is spontaneously living within us.</p><p>May we all see that God puts His trust in those who are truly obedient and consecrated. God's will is manifested through such ones. May the Lord deliver us from all kinds of passivity and foolishness so that we do not follow Him in darkness.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">CONSECRATION LEADING TO<br />THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD'S WILL</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: Lord's Day morning, December 15, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1-2</h1><p>Prayer: Lord, in the past You have not been able to gain much in us. May we gain something of You today so that You can gain something in us. We are poor, defiled, empty, and weak. We come to You with a sober heart, looking to You for Your mercy. Lord, be merciful to us, even today. In Your name we pray, amen.</p><p>Romans 12 shows us that God's compassions are the starting point of all spiritual things and God's will is the terminating point. We are saved through God's compassion, forgiven through God's compassion, and receive eternal life through God's compassion. God's compassion has put us in this way and leads us on in this way until in the end, we can prove God's will, that which is good, well pleasing, and perfect.</p><p>During the past few days, many people have asked how we can know God's will. Many people think that knowing His will is a matter of technique. They think that as long as they have the right technique, they can know God's will. But the knowledge of God's will is not a cheap thing. It is a very precious thing, and it demands a great price from those who want it. The more precious a thing is, the higher the price one has to pay in order to have it. Many of God's children ask, "How can I know God's will?", but they never ask, "What kind of person is qualified to know His will?"</p><p>Romans 12:1-2 speaks of three things: (1) consecration&mdash;presenting of oneself as a living sacrifice, (2) transformation by the renewing of the mind, and (3) knowledge of the will of God. This shows us that there are conditions to knowing God's will. I have a heavy word within my heart, which I will tell you if you allow me. There is no way I can help some people to know God's will; helping them to know God's will is like helping this table to know God's will. You can give a person a set of formulas for knowing God's will, but the man himself will still not know His will. You can explain the way to know God's will, but he will still not know it.</p><h2 class="head1">CONSECRATION</h2><p>First, we have to realize that God's will is not for an unconsecrated person. If a man has not seen God's goal and not realized that God's redemption is for the purpose of reaching His goal and if he continues to live for himself, he cannot know God's will.</p><p>In the Old Testament one could be either a priest or a sacrifice. He could not be a priest and a sacrifice at the same time. But in the New Testament, a man can be both a priest and sacrifice at the same time. You may ask, "What is a living sacrifice?" A living sacrifice means a person who is killed, laid on the altar, and burned to ashes. The most important issue for those who are serving the Lord is not how much they have done. That is not real service. The most important thing is being a living sacrifice. What a man does can never surpass what is laid on the altar. Even the most holy and acceptable service to God cannot surpass one's service on the altar. It is not a matter of our words, works, zeal, miracles, gifts, or even tears. It is a matter of the cross operating within us.</p><p>Friends, the day will come (I have said this many times) when God will break the backbone of your natural life. You may say, "I have heard this many times." However, it is not a question of how many times you have heard this, but of whether or not your backbone has been dealt with by God.</p><p>Many people realize that their self is a troublesome thing. Often when I pray with others or when I listen to others praying, they weep as they confess their destitution, defeat, flesh, and carnality. They tell the Lord that they want to be dealt with. But even though they pray this way, they are still not dealt with. I have seen people who are very cautious about themselves; they read the Bible and pray every day, and they make resolutions concerning this and that. But day after day they remain weak and defeated. Even the humility of some people is an ugly thing. The problem is they have never become a sacrifice. If I pluck off a few hairs from a bull or cut its skin a little, that is, if I deal with it a little here and a little there, I will only fill my neighbors' ears with the bull's cry. In reality this has no real effect. The whole bull must be offered on the altar, killed, and burned, before there can be a sacrifice. Our dealings before God must not be fragmentary; we are not here to deal with ancillary things. We are not here to deal with a little temper here, a little pride there, or a little something here and a little something there. These kind of dealings have no spiritual value. The important thing is having our backbones broken once and for all.</p><p>Romans 12 says that we have to present our whole body. It is not a question of how many times we have offered ourselves. This presenting is not a fragmentary offering where we offer a little here and a little there. This is a once and for all total offering, in which the whole person is laid on the altar. If a man is constituted with only that which is visible, he has nothing but outward, manufactured behavior. This is counterfeit spirituality, and there is no spiritual reality behind it at all. Some say that they are useless, but one cannot find others who have more self-esteem than these ones. Some speak in a humble way, but one cannot find others who have more pride than they. Brothers and sisters, have you experienced God's thorough dealing? This kind of thorough dealing can save God much trouble. Many people experience isolated dealings from the Lord, and these dealings make them prouder than they were before. But those who have gone through a fundamental dealing cannot be proud even when they want to. Only those who are willing to present their bodies as a living sacrifice to God are well pleasing to Him.</p><p>Many people are talking about their ministries, but no ministry can match the ministry of the cross. When we present ourselves to be a sacrifice, we are not offering ourselves to plow the field or to bear burdens, but to be a sacrifice, to be slain. An ox is a beast of burden or a beast for tilling. But after it is offered up and has become a sacrifice, its ministry is no longer the bearing of burdens or the plowing of fields. Its ministry is to be slaughtered. Real service is the service of sacrifice. The knowledge that we have of the cross cannot exceed the ministry of the cross in us. When the Lord was on earth, He served God with the cross. Humanly speaking, He did not do anything before the age of thirty. But remember: His public ministry began with His baptism. The cross is the starting point of our work. Everything that exists before the cross has no spiritual value. If a man has not experienced Golgotha, his life, work, spiritual pursuit, and progress are all works and things. Only that which has passed through the altar constitutes a sacrifice, and only that is well pleasing to God. A Christian must go through a basic dealing of the cross at least once. You can call it by whatever name you want, but every Christian needs a fresh start. How hard it is for one to drop his own will and stand for God's will!</p><p>Not long after I was saved, a sister said, "When you pray, you have to pray for what God wants, not for what you want." I answered, "If I do not ask for what I want, why do I need to pray at all?" Later, God dealt with me, and I became different. I was not as bothersome as before, asking God for this and that all the time.</p><h2 class="head1">TRANSFORMATION BY THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</h2><p>The section above covers the negative aspect. Now let us consider our positive union with the Lord.</p><p>In verse 2 the word "mind" in Greek is nous. The word "bodies" in verse 1 is soma in Greek. When the outward body is presented as a sacrifice, there is one positive result: the renewing and transformation of the mind. Verse 2 points out a matter on the negative side: "Do not be fashioned according to this age." In the Bible the world refers to the world organization and the world spirit. It does not necessarily refer to the outward things of the world. A Christian can shun all the things in the world, but the spirit of the world can still be in him. The Israelites left Egypt in their bodies, but their minds were still craving Egypt. Who can give up the love of the world? Only those who are consecrated and whose minds have been renewed and transformed can give up the love of the world. Many Christians act and live the same way as the people in the world. Their minds and thoughts are the same as the people in the world. We often say that a person is very political or that he is very smart or business-minded. When God delivers us, He delivers us out of all kinds of worldly minds. A perplexing thing among God's children is that their guidance concerning God's will is often based on their mind. They discern God's will according to their political and business-like mind. But when the cross touches our whole being, it touches our mind as well. Only those whose minds are renewed can have a transformed mind.</p><p>In Romans 12:1-2 there are things that we should do and things that we should not do. We should not be fashioned according to this age. This means that we should not walk according to the manner of this world; instead, we should be renewed and transformed. Renewal is on our side, and transformation is on God's side. This means being changed from the world image and our self image to the image of the Lord. This is transformation. Not only does our mind have to be renewed in regard to sinful things, but in regard to our total walk and spiritual life as well. In this renewal we experience resurrection. Originally, the sacrifices are dead. But when Christ lives in us, we have the mind, the thoughts, and the understanding of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD'S WILL</h2><p>Not everyone can know God's will. Only those whose bodies are presented as living sacrifices and whose minds are renewed and transformed can know His will. Then the knowledge of His will comes effortlessly and spontaneously.</p><p>God's will is the manifestation of His life. His life is clean and pure; it enables men to discern the flesh and the natural man and delivering men from carnality and worldliness. Only those who are delivered from these things can know God's will and prove what the will of the Lord is. When we present our bodies and are renewed and transformed in our mind, we can know God's will. There is no easier or lighter way than the cross.</p><p>The easiest and quickest way to know God's will is through the cross. Only the stripping and smiting of the cross will expose the natural life, the flesh, the lusts, the world, and the human mind. Only through the stripping will we know the power of the cross. It is useless to lecture, teach, or exhort others. They may be very eager to learn. But if they have not consecrated themselves, they will not receive any help at all. However, when the cross operates in them, their mind will be renewed and transformed. The natural life must be dealt with before one can see any result in the spiritual life.</p><p>It is easy to criticize, but it is hard to have a vision of the spiritual things. It is easy to slander, but it is hard to discern and to judge. There is a difference between proper discernment and criticism. Those who are in the light will discern without criticism or slander.</p><p>What do we know about God's will? Romans 12:2 says that God's will is good. Because something is good does not necessarily make it God's will, but all that is of God's will is good. If a believer's mind is renewed before God, this mind surely will be good. Many people can talk about God's will with their mouth, but only those who know the cross can say that God's will is good. God's will is also perfect. This means that it is flawless and irreproachable. God's will is also well pleasing. When we present our bodies as a living sacrifice, we are doing something well pleasing to God, and God's will also becomes well pleasing to us. At this point all murmurings cease, and there are no complaints against heaven or against man. God's will is not in man's mind, wavering and fluctuating like the waves. It is something that is manifested before men. Only those who rest in the Lord can know God's will. If a man is in a state of turmoil, confusion, grievance, and unrest, it means that he does not have the mark of the cross. Such a one cannot know God's will. If we criticize, complain, or are dissatisfied with God's will, it means that we have never consecrated ourselves to the Lord. If a man thinks that his means are better and his ways are higher, it shows that he is void of light and has not seen the cross.</p><p>In order to know God's will, we have to present our bodies as a living sacrifice. We should not be fashioned according to this age, and our minds must be renewed and transformed. These three things are the conditions for knowing God's will. God's will is a great thing. When we have these three facts with us, we will have no problem in knowing God's will. Otherwise, we will never know it in a genuine way.</p><p>Prayer: Lord! May these words not be words that just come out of our mouth. May they be the cries from our heart. Be merciful to us. We do not want to be dealt with in a fragmentary way. Deal with us once and for all in a fundamental way. May we not murmur, and may our only fear be of not knowing Your will. We look to You for Your mercy and shining so that we can know God's will thoroughly and clearly. In Your name we pray, amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">A TALK WITH THE CO-WORKERS&mdash;<br />MAN SPEAKING GOD'S WORD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 20, 1940<br />Place: Shanghai</h1><p>The Bible is made up of words, but it is not man's word. It is God's word spoken through man. The Bible records the speaking of Daniel, Isaiah, Paul, etc. These men spoke on behalf of God, but this does not merely mean that God was speaking through Daniel, Isaiah, and Paul. It also means that the words that were spoken were also the words of Daniel, Isaiah, and Paul themselves.</p><p>It is not a question of how much of God's Word we can memorize or how well we can quote it. Nor is it a matter of how much we know or how familiar we are with God's Word. The real issue is whether or not we can represent God when we speak. We all know that Paul wrote two Epistles to the Corinthians. There are some words in his Epistles which he confessed were not commandments of the Lord (1 Cor. 7:25). He could say this because he had become one with Christ. We can say that he was speaking what the Lord was speaking. These words were not words of inspiration, but words that were the result of Paul's constitution. When Paul spoke, it was Christ speaking.</p><p>Words of inspiration and revelation can be received in an instant. But it takes a long process for Christ to be constituted and formed in us. This process cannot be accomplished within a short period of time. It is a prolonged work that goes on a little at a time. One has to maintain a continual hidden fellowship with the Lord before such constitution can be produced.</p><p>In quoting God's Word, we have to pay attention to one thing. It is not a matter of quoting the words that God spoke to men of old, like Moses, and applying it to situations today. It is a matter of whether or not we can speak what God wants us to speak when we quote such a word. In his time Moses spoke what God wanted him to speak. Can you say that God wants to speak the same thing to men today? Can you say that this is not just a quotation?</p><p>There was a time when I cared very much for Bible exposition and memorization. But today I consider them only as a means to reach God's goal. Frankly speaking, I am quite disappointed with our co-workers. Some have picked up what I have dropped. Some are still earnestly pursuing what I have given up. The Bible is the best gauge; it measures our real condition. The condition that many are in today does not qualify them to hear God's word. As far as we are concerned, we must not only have God's spoken word, the logos, that is, the black and white letters, but also the Lord's shining of these spoken words in our spirit to become the instant word, the rhema, before we can speak these words.</p><p>For example, many people can give a message on the story of Cain and Abel. But it is not a matter of whether one can extract more novel teachings from these passages. It is a matter of whether or not God can speak what He wants to speak to man today through such a message.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S SPEAKING FROM THE BUSH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Exo. 3</h1><p>When Moses was in Egypt, he was involved in two cases of quarreling (Exo. 2:11-14). Through these two incidents, God showed him that trusting in the flesh, in carnality, or in man's power was useless. These two matters became his snares, and Pharaoh sought his life. Because he wanted to escape from Pharaoh, he went to the land of the Midianites and shepherded the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro. He passed through many humble, dry, and monotonous days while he was there. He spent forty silent years learning lessons before God and receiving dealings from His hands.</p><p>Thank God that one day God decided that Moses could be used. Moses was no longer like the man he was forty years ago, full of the flesh and his own energy, ability, and zeal, but useless in God's hand. Moses had become very meek. There was no more fleshly or natural energy in him, and he no longer trusted in himself. God was now able to use him, and He appeared to him on Mount Horeb and called him from a burning bush. I believe that Moses never dreamed that God would call him; he never dreamed that God would grant a revelation to him. On that day he took his father-in-law's flock to the wilderness, and as he had always done, he went to God's mount, Mount Horeb. I do not know whether he heard God's speaking during his morning watch or if he even had a morning watch. I do not know whether he received a vision in his room that morning, but I believe that he did not receive anything. It was a most common morning, a morning that was the same as any other morning. But that day turned out to be the greatest day in Moses' spiritual history; it was a turning point in his life. From that day on, his path was different. He received a new commission for a new work. He was called by God to bring the Israelites out of Egypt into a good and great land, a land flowing with milk and honey, on whose mount the Israelites would serve their God.</p><p>This is the experience of many Christians today. God deals with many Christians in the same way today. Many think that they are capable, gifted, and powerful. They think they can be zealous for God, work for God, and help God. But one day they are brought face to face with reality and see that they have done nothing but useless works. All of their endeavors are nothing but failures. Then they will think that they have failed. They will change their direction, put everything aside, caring only to live a self-contented and unambitious life, drearily tending the flock in the wilderness. All these are part of God's dealing, the purpose of which is to destroy the natural man.</p><p>While Moses was in Pharaoh's palace, he learned all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his words and works (Acts 7:22). But God did not speak to him or call him at that time. God waited until Moses had gone into the wilderness and endured a long period of shepherding before He appeared to him and spoke to him. Only after such a long period of time did the Lord deem that the time was ripe to speak to man.</p><p>Today many people are living in their "palaces," and it is useless for the Lord to speak to them. When the Lord says one word, they rejoin with ten words. When the Lord speaks to them about the east, they speak to the Lord about the west. It seems as if they are more capable and able than the Lord. I have no way to speak to many brothers and sisters because they cannot and will not listen. Such ones need to be dealt with by time. Although they have wasted many days, it is still not too late for them to turn. According to man, Moses' forty years silently passed without anything happening. But to God, these forty years were an indispensable "waste."</p><p>Exodus 3:2 says, "And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed." This verse says "behold." When a man thinks that he is qualified to work for the Lord, that is often not the right time for him to do anything. God often calls man when he least expects it. God called David out of the sheepcote while he was following the sheep (2 Sam. 7:8). He called Gideon while he was threshing wheat (Judg. 6:11-23). He called Samuel while he was sleeping (1 Sam. 3:3-10). The case of Saul of Tarsus was even more dramatic; he was called by the Lord while he was opposing and persecuting Him (Acts 9:1-16).</p><p>This is why Paul said, "So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" (Rom. 9:16). Willing refers to the resolve of the heart, whereas running refers to man's outward acts, which are performed by his own strength. Neither has any place in God's calling and selection. God speaks to man from the bush. Speaking from the bush means that God often speaks to us through very common things. He does not necessarily speak to us through the preaching of a pastor in the sanctuary. I am not saying that God never speaks to us through others' preaching, but I am saying that He may not always do this.</p><p>Before God spoke from the bush, there was first a burning and shining fire in the bush. When Moses saw this, he turned aside to see it, and then God spoke to him. May the Lord bring us to the point where He can speak to us. Today He is still speaking from the bush. He speaks to us from our daily life and from all the matters that we confront daily. May we all hear His speaking.</p><h1 class="series">SECTION FIFTEEN<br />MESSAGES AND FELLOWSHIP<br />IN SHANGHAI IN 1941</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S ETERNAL PLAN</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: 1941<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:3-23 (Please pay special attention to vv. 4-5, 11, 16-19.)</h1><h2 class="head1">EPHESIANS AND GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE</h2><p>Ephesians is a book on God's eternal purpose. It speaks of God's purpose more than once and covers the lofty and eternal aspects of His purpose. In chapter one Paul prayed for the saints to see and know. Chapter two points out the saints' relationship with the Lord and with the church. In chapter three Paul prayed for the building up of the church. Today we will concentrate on the prayer in chapter one.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING AND KNOWING THREE THINGS</h2><p>Paul prayed for three things in chapter one. He prayed that the saints would see and know God's calling, His inheritance in the saints, and His power toward those who believe. God's eternal plan is related to His calling, His inheritance, and His power.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Calling</h2><p>First, the saints must see the hope of God's calling. Verse 4 describes this calling: "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love." God has called us to this condition, that is, to be holy and without blemish. If we compare this picture with the actual situation of Christians today, we can see that there is a great difference between the two.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Inheritance in the Saints</h2><p>Second, the saints have to see God's inheritance in them. Concerning His inheritance, verse 5 says that God predestinated us unto sonship and verse 11 says that He predestinated us to be an inheritance. God's inheritance in the saints is for us to become His inheritance, which is for us to receive the sonship. God's plan is related to sons. God's predestination has nothing to do with man's salvation or perdition; it has to do with Him having many sons. God has predestinated us unto sonship. Theologians pointlessly argue about predestination unto salvation or predestination unto perdition. Galatians 4 and Hebrews 2 both speak of sonship. At the appointed time God will redeem His people unto sonship, that is, He will receive His inheritance. Redemption is a parenthetical move, whereas predestination unto sonship is a matter that occupies an eternal place in God's things.</p><p>What does it mean to inherit an inheritance? When we inherit an inheritance, it means that someone else's possession becomes ours. All fixed assets and other assets become ours. On the one hand, we receive an inheritance, which is the sonship. On the other hand, God receives an inheritance in us, which means that He gains and possesses us.</p><h2 class="head2">God's Power in the Believers</h2><p>There are two parts in God's work. The first part was accomplished before the foundation of the world. The second part was accomplished on the cross. God's plan was accomplished before the foundation of the world, whereas the problem of man's fall was dealt with by the accomplishment of the Lord on the cross. Ephesians 1:7 says, "In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace." God's power in the believers is the power which He caused to operate in Christ. This power raised Christ from the dead and seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenlies. Today this power is operating in the believers for the accomplishment of God's purpose.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TODAY</h2><p>What Christians need today is a revelation from God. They need to see God's accomplished work rather than asking Him to do some new work. For Paul the battle was in the proclamation of God's eternal plan. For the saints the battle lies in seeing this plan. For Paul this was a matter of speaking the eternal plan. For the saints it is a matter of seeing the eternal plan. Paul prayed for this; He asked the Father to give to the saints in Ephesus a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that they would see that God has accomplished everything. This is the special character of the book of Ephesians. Everything is accomplished, whether it is the work before the foundation of the world or the work on the cross.</p><p>Suppose a brother wants to deal with his temper. He tries once, twice, even many times, but without success. He repeatedly fails, and eventually he blames God in his heart for not working on him or dealing with his temper. However, the real problem lies in this person's heart&mdash;he only hopes that God will do something. He thinks that his problems would be solved and he would overcome if only God would do something. But verse 3 says that God has already given us every spiritual blessing in Christ. We must see this in order to receive this revelation. We have to ask ourselves why we cannot believe that God has accomplished everything. We do not need to ask for greater power from God to overcome our temper. We only need to ask the Lord to show us the facts that Christ accomplished on the cross. All we have to do is to claim them by faith. The Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross. Three days later He resurrected. Resurrection is the pinnacle of God's work; He need not advance any further than resurrection. We need not ask God to do anything for us; the only thing we need is revelation.</p><p>Revelation reveals God's accomplished facts. It connects us to the past. Revelation is not necessarily something related to the future. Many people hope that they will overcome in the future, but God wants us to see what has already been accomplished on the cross. Once we see this, we will release our praise! The power that God operates in us who believe is the same power that raised Christ from the dead. This is too wonderful! This power operates in us just as it operated in Christ when God raised Him from the dead! This power enables life to enter into death and come out again. Today we do not need to seek or pray for greater power. We have to see that Christ has already attained everything; He has obtained the power that transcends everything. Our power does not lie in what God is going to do, but in seeing what He has already done. Revelation is the key to everything.</p><p>Our regeneration is based on seeing God's accomplished redemption on the cross of Christ. In reading Ephesians we realize that man's unique need is revelation. We must see that the power in the believers is a power that subdues Hades and that prevails over death and the devil. A Christian becomes weak because he does not have revelation. Whether or not a Christian is victorious depends on whether he sees and has revelation; it has nothing to do with how much power he has. Those who have revelation spontaneously have power. Those who do not have revelation will fail no matter how hard they struggle.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER AND REVELATION</h2><p>Paul prayed that the believers would have revelation and that they would see. Prayer brings in revelation. It shows us that we are saved, that we are liberated, that life has entered into death, and that new life has come out of death. This resurrection life enables us to experience all that Christ has gone through and consummates in the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE DIVIDING OF<br />THE SOUL AND THE SPIRIT<br />AND THE WORD OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: February 8, 1941, evening<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: Psa. 119:130; Heb. 4:12-13</h1><h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVIDING<br />THE SOUL AND SPIRIT</h2><p>Today Christians ask many questions. They often ask themselves, "Was I in the soul or in the spirit when I did this thing? Was this something out of myself or of the Lord? Was I following the flesh or following the Spirit?" Actually what we do is not that crucial. The outward things are not that crucial. The crucial thing is whether or not our inner being is in darkness. If it is, we are in trouble. Some people like to analyze their situation, but the more they analyze, the more confused they are and the less clear they become. They analyze so much that they can no longer go on, and they fall into a kind of spiritual sickness. Others are engaged in another kind of analysis: they analyze themselves. They often become very confident of themselves. They are very clear about what is spiritual and what is soulish. They seem to be very clear and confident about all spiritual things. However, the more confident a person is, the more he needs mercy from the Lord. Self-analysis is not of God, whether or not one feels that he is doing the right thing, and whether or not he is confident about it. As long as this analysis is not the direct result of God's shining, it is based in darkness. Of course, every Christian has to go through this stage of "inner darkness" in his spiritual journey. It is, in fact, quite beneficial to us to have this inner darkness, because this forces us to go to God and to seek for light. However, it is not God's will for a Christian to continually live in darkness and foolishness, deprived of light. God wants us to know what the will of the Lord is (Eph. 5:17). It is unhealthy for a Christian to remain in darkness for a long period of time, being ignorant of the Lord's will, failing to divide the soul and spirit, and not discerning the difference between the spiritual and the carnal.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOD'S WORD</h2><p>How can we divide the soul and spirit and discern the difference between the soulish and the spiritual? The Bible shows us that God's word alone is living and operative and able to divide our soul and spirit. Hebrews 4 speaks of the operation of God's word. His word operates not only in man's bone, but in the marrow as well. God's word is operative. If a man has God's word, this word will bring him light. The light in His word will enlighten everything within us. It will make us inwardly clear and divide our soul and our spirit, the soulish and the spiritual. We do not need Bible doctrines or teachings in the letter. We do not need spiritual methods. What we need is the Lord's enlightening. Once God's word comes, His light shines in the innermost part of our being, and the spirit is spontaneously divided from the soul. When a man is clear within, he no longer needs to ask what is soulish and what is spiritual. The dividing of the soul and spirit does not come by asking or research. When the word of God operates in man, the spirit and the soul are divided.</p><p>At the time of regeneration a believer receives God's life into him, and the law of life begins to operate. Yet many believers have not allowed this law of life to manifest itself. The manifestation of the law of life is hindered when a man lives in the soul. Those who live in their soul do not know the things of the spirit, because the Holy Spirit cannot break through from their spirit. First Corinthians 2:14 says, "But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually." Many people are governed by their thoughts, conscience, emotions, sentiments, and ideas in their daily life. No soulish person can know the things of the Spirit. Those who are soulish and those who are spiritual are in two different worlds, two different realms, and two different kingdoms. When a man lives in the soulish realm, he knows nothing of the things of the Spirit, and he considers them to be foolishness.</p><p>Some people say that I like to criticize others. Actually, I have no interest in criticizing others. But if someone says this pillar is white when it is black, I can only say that it is black. I know for sure that it is black. I do not care what others say. Some also say that my messages point out what is wrong but do not offer what is right. It seems that I always point out others' mistakes but do not tell others what to do. Actually, when all the wrong things are exposed, the right things will be manifested. The important thing is for a man to know where he has gone wrong. If a man lives in darkness, he will never experience deliverance. Once a man finds his mistakes and steps into the light, it becomes easy for him to experience deliverance.</p><p>Darkness is the result of the lack of light. The way to be delivered out of spiritual darkness is through the word of God. Once God's word enters a man, he will immediately and clearly see what is soulish and what is spiritual. As a result many problems will no longer be problems. We need to ask for God's word to come into us and to enlighten us so that our soul can be divided from our spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL DISCERNMENT<br />OF GOOD AND EVIL</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: February 9, 1941<br />Place: Shanghai<br />Scripture Reading: Gen. 3; Heb. 4:12; 5:13-14</h1><h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL<br />BY THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE<br />OF GOOD AND EVIL&mdash;<br />BRINGING IN DEATH</h2><p>When man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he brought in spiritual death. Man became spiritually dead in the eyes of God. The more that a man lives in the condition of death, the more he is involved in the knowledge of good and evil. As soon as a man departs from the life of God, he will be in the knowledge of good and evil. The knowledge of good and evil is a sign of death. If man had eaten of the fruit of the tree of life, he would not have needed an outward knowledge of good and evil, because life itself can differentiate between good and evil. There would have been no need for man to acquire the knowledge of good and evil by eating the fruit of that tree. The more a man knows life, the more he knows God, and the less he will need to rely on some outward knowledge of good and evil. But when man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he separated himself from the tree of life and from God. Today man has fallen completely into the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Those who are unregenerated, who do not know God, and who know nothing about life like to talk about good, evil, philosophy, ethics, morality, decency, indecency, right, and wrong.</p><h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL DISCERNMENT OF GOOD AND EVIL&mdash;<br />THE MARK OF MATURITY IN LIFE</h2><p>Man's communication with God is not based on good and evil, but on life. Life contains the proper knowledge of good and evil, and this knowledge of life is a mark of maturity in life. In Genesis 3 there is the knowledge of good and evil that is the result of the tree of knowledge, while in Hebrews 5 there is another knowledge of good and evil that comes from the discriminating between good and evil. The knowledge of good and evil in Genesis 3 is death, while the discrimination between good and evil in Hebrews 5 is an expression of the growth and maturity of life. This shows us that Christians should have the knowledge of good and evil. Furthermore, this knowledge is a mark of the maturity in life.</p><p>Some Christians continue to live according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil after they are saved. They are constantly trying to tell the difference between good and evil. They often ask if they should do this or that. There are other Christians, however, who can discriminate between good and evil. But their discrimination is a discernment from God as to what is good and what is evil. This kind of discrimination is spiritual; it is the proper kind of knowledge for Christians. Christians should be able to tell the difference between right and wrong. There is a need among Christians to differentiate between that which is good and that which is evil. Hebrews 5:12 says that Christians should know "what the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God are" and what the deeper things are. This kind of discriminating is not an ordinary kind of discrimination. It is a discrimination of the spiritually deep things from the shallow things, the babes from the full-grown. Not only is there the need to discriminate between that which is outwardly good and evil, but in the eyes of God, there is the need to discriminate between the good and evil even among all the "good" things. In the eyes of God some are taking solid food and some are taking milk; some are babes and some are full-grown.</p><p>A new Christian thinks that all believers are wonderful in their life, their work, and their daily walk. But gradually he will be able to discriminate between the good and the bad. This is the beginning of maturity. When one is mature, he will know whether a certain thing is evil in the eyes of God even though it may be considered good in the eyes of men. This is the mark of maturity. Unfortunately, the church today is filled with too many childish things, and many Christians are still in the infant stage. They still cannot discriminate between the rudimentary things and the mature things. Before the Lord we must learn to have a spiritual knowledge of good and evil and not remain in the infant stage. We should have our faculties exercised for discriminating between good and evil.</p><h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY</h2><p>In 1925 I was in the midst of publishing the second issue of The Christian, covering Daniel, 2 Thessalonians, and Revelation. At that time I was not very knowledgeable concerning the prophecies, and I wrote about them in a very brief way. I attached to it a preface and sent it to the printer. I felt very good about it and did not have much regret about printing it. Moreover, I received over three hundred responses from readers telling me that they had liked it and received help, encouragement, and admonition from it. I felt quite proud of myself. One day, as I was with Miss Barber, I asked, "Have you received a copy of The Christian that I edited? What do you think of its content?" She was not interested in this at all, talking only about her tea and cakes. I tried a few more times to draw her attention to my magazine, but she kept on talking about tea, cakes, and candies. When I was about to leave, she said one word to me, "Brother, one day you will discover that good things are not necessarily good." I asked if she was referring to the second issue of The Christian, and she said yes. She continued, saying, "If I had to put out ten issues of The Christian, I would not put those things in one of them. I would write on something else." At that time I did not appreciate what she said. But day after day, I began to realize that it is not how much we can produce and achieve, but how much God has done. Everything that issues from man is futile, whether it is human wisdom or human power.</p><p>One time I took a sister to visit Miss Barber. The sister did something wrong, and after Miss Barber spoke with her, she cried from morning until the afternoon. I went back and asked Miss Barber, "Do you know that she has been crying?" I thought that her repentance was wonderful. But after Miss Barber heard my word, her reaction was very cold. I tried my best to describe how repentant the sister was, but Miss Barber replied, "She is pitying herself! I do not like to help this kind of person." At that time I could not quite take these words. I felt that Miss Barber was compassionless, uncaring, and unsympathetic toward others. But after a year or two I found that she was right. I thought that repentance, tears, weeping, and remorse for one's own sins were the right things to have. But she was able to discriminate between good and evil. This is not a matter of criticism or compassion, but a matter of seeing or not seeing. The one who had the vision had the spiritual knowledge of good and evil, but I did not have it.</p><p>Once I took over sixty co-workers to see Miss Barber. She said "If five or six from among these ones remain to follow the Lord, we should be thankful and praise the Lord." In reflecting on her words today, I can see that it is just about that number that are still following the Lord in a genuine way.</p><p>Miss Barber possessed this spiritual ability to discriminate between good and evil. The good and evil that I am speaking of here are different from the good and evil that ordinary men speak of. In many instances what is good and evil to man may be exactly the opposite in the eyes of God. Those who are good at criticizing others often have a wrong spirit. But those who have the knowledge of good and evil have the right eyes for things. Because their eyes have seen the light, their words are a kind of spiritual discernment rather than a kind of criticism.</p><p>I appreciate Brother Austin-Sparks because he also has such a spiritual ability to discriminate between good and evil. One man lived together with me for a few months; however, Brother Austin-Sparks seldom saw him. Yet he knew this man more than I did. We are not here to criticize others. Those who criticize others will not have God's blessings. But we do need a kind of spiritual discernment. Our knowledge of good and evil should not only be applied to people, but should be applied to things as well. Many times in making judgments on things, those who have the light can tell the difference between good and evil. Those who have seen the light do not even need to seek after God's will; they are already clear about God's will within themselves.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO THE SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE<br />OF GOOD AND EVIL</h2><h2 class="head2">God's Word</h2><p>Genesis 3 and Hebrews 4 and 5 are three places in the Bible that speak of the knowledge of good and evil. The discriminating between good and evil in Hebrews 5 is spiritual; it is a mark of maturity. Hebrews 4 tells us how we can discriminate between good and evil, and where the power of discrimination lies. Only God can discriminate between good and evil because all things are laid bare before His eyes and cannot be hidden. There are many things which are unknown to man, but God says that those who are spiritual can discern all things (1 Cor. 2:15). This is what Hebrews 4 speaks of. God's word can divide and cut asunder man's soul and spirit, discerning the true nature of things. Soulish ones criticize others and exercise their mind to split hairs over small things. But spiritual things can be known only in an inward way. A person must first be dealt with. Before he can have a clear vision before God concerning all things, he must first have God's word.</p><h2 class="head2">Without Self-analysis</h2><p>Many Christians ask questions all the time. The greatest temptation they face in trying to know God's will is their constant introspection, self-analysis, and attempt to find what is of God and what is of themselves. They want to know what is of the spirit and what is of the soul, what is spiritual and what is carnal. Such ones will never understand God's will. For man to make judgments in himself will result in nothing but error. In John 13&mdash;15 Philip, Peter, Thomas, and Judas asked many questions, but in chapter fourteen the Lord told them that a day would come when they would no longer need to ask anything, because the Holy Spirit would teach them of all things when He came (v. 26). When a person asks questions, this proves that he does not have the presence of the Holy Spirit. Those who know the Spirit do not need to ask questions. Those who have God, who have the anointing, and who have God's word are clear within; they do not need to ask anything.</p><p>In Psalm 139:23 the psalmist asked God to search and know his heart. This is because man's heart is wicked above all things. A man can deceive himself; he can be cheated to think that he is the best. But in the eyes of God, what we consider the best may be the worst. God never asks us to engage in introspection. He never asks us to discern what is of the spirit and what is of the soul. This is not the responsibility of the Christian; it is the responsibility of the word of God. God's word is living and is sharper than any two-edged sword. It can divide and cut asunder man's spirit and soul. Some may say, "I have read the Bible a few times, but I do not feel that my spirit and soul have been divided." We must realize that the dividing of the spirit and the soul has to do with our seeing. It has to do with revelation, not with our studying. Those who strive to know are living in darkness; they are not living by the law of life.</p><p>Those who have not seen the light may think that they have been a good Christian for many years. They love the brothers and sisters, offer material offerings, and have dealt with sin and the world, etc. They may be very satisfied with themselves, and others may say that they are good Christians, having received much help from them. But when God's light shines on them, they will see that many of their so-called good works are actually the most defiled and offensive works in the eyes of God. They will discover many of the things they do are actually sins in the eyes of God. Revelation can never come about through human wisdom. Before Paul was saved, he opposed Christ and persecuted the Christians, thinking that he was serving God. He was the most zealous among all the Judaizers and was more advanced than his contemporaries, yet he was opposing God's work. A man may think that his motives are pure, that he is for God, but in reality he may be doing a work that is against God. Such a one is living in darkness; he does not have God's light. Today the dividing line between everything rests with God's word. Once we have light within, we will see everything. This is totally different from the knowledge of good and evil that is spoken of in Genesis 2 and 3.</p><p>I am not saying that it is useless to read and study the Bible, and I am not saying that it is useless to listen to messages. I am saying that these things alone cannot solve our problems. What we need is God's light. When the living word of God comes, we can no longer live as before. God's word will kill us, and His light will remove all that is not of God. We may think that we have a great deal of goodness in us, but when God reveals Himself, we will see that all of our goodness is but refuse. Then we will begin to gain spiritual knowledge. Our faculties will become more exercised. We will be able to discriminate between good and evil, and we will grow and mature.</p><p>At the beginning of his Christian life, a Christian should not analyze himself. He should not ask so many questions; instead, he should learn to look to the Lord and ask the Lord for revelation and light. Once he has the light, he will be able to discriminate between good and evil. His mouth may not be able to clearly articulate the difference, but his inner being will be very clear. The real issue is whether or not one has God's word and God's light. When God's word comes, the thoughts and intents of the heart will be divided and exposed like the bone and the marrow. The human mind is incapable of understanding the things of the Spirit. The things of the Spirit are things that eyes have not seen, ears have not heard,  and hearts have not imagined (1 Cor. 2:9). The soulish man cannot comprehend the things of God (v. 14). Inward judgment has nothing to do with good and evil or even the apparent right and wrong of matters. It has to do with God's word within us. It is God's word that divides the spirit and the soul. Only God's word can operate this way.</p><p>I used to work in Amoy. Sometimes when the work was finished, I would find the result encouraging; men had received help and rewarded me with praises. But deep within, I felt like something had snapped; I felt like a deflated tire. At other times the result of the work would be the same, but I found myself filled with strength inwardly, more so than before I had worked. All the workers should learn from the Lord, who in quenching the Samaritan woman's thirst, was filled Himself. If a work does not bring inward satisfaction, there must be something wrong with the work. The Lord's food was to do the will of the One who had sent Him and to finish His work (John 4:34). A worker must learn to seek after God's word and to work according to His living guidance. He should not work according to what he thinks is good, but according to what the Lord thinks is good.</p><p>After a man is regenerated, the first thing he should do is to allow God's word to come into him and to divide his spirit and soul. I do not know how many of the things that we have done were done out of ourselves, our ideas, and our concepts of good. We even considered them to be God's will. Many people need to repent and confess for what they have repented and confessed about. Many times even our tears are unclean in the eyes of the Lord, and they need the cleansing of the blood. We must see the worldliness of the love that we have known. We must see that the fellowship that we have known has been nothing more than social enjoyment. The light of the cross must come into us to wreck us and expose our wickedness. If we have never passed through such a thorough experience, we may bear the cross, do our work, exercise our love, preach our gospel, and render our help to others. But one day we will find that all these things have been done in ignorance. May the Lord be merciful to us. May He give us the light. May we be torn down and broken so that we will have the spiritual sight and will have a proper spiritual discrimination.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>Lord, although man's word can disappear, may Your word be remembered. May the self be checked, and may we all receive a light like Paul's. May Your light kill us. May You answer us not according to our prayer, but according to Your riches and supply. In Your name we pray, amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">A TALK</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: February 25, 1941<br />Place: Unrecorded</h1><h2 class="head1">CHRIST'S TESTIMONY BEFORE PILATE</h2><p>Brother Chang asked: First Timothy 6:13 speaks of Christ's testimony before Pilate. What does this refer to?</p><p>Brother Nee answered: Christ's testimony at His trial before Pilate was twofold in nature. First, it testified that He was the Son of God. Second, it testified that He was the Christ, the king of the Jews. The Jews condemned the Lord because He said that He was the Son of God. Pilate did not condemn the Lord. Although the Lord said that He was a king, Pilate considered His testimony to be the words of a madman, so he ignored it. The matter of being the Son of God is a religious matter, whereas the matter of being the king is a political matter. When others asked Him many questions, He did not answer them. But when the question involved the Son of God and the king, He immediately testified, "You have said rightly" (Matt. 26:64; 27:11). In the Gospel of John, the Lord also said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling so that I would not be delivered to the Jews" (18:36).</p><h2 class="head1">NOT OF THIS WORLD</h2><p>The Lord said that His kingdom was not of this world. If we misunderstand His word we will miss God's blessing. The word of can also be translated as "out of." To be not of this world means to be not out of this world. To be not of the world does not mean that we do not communicate with those in the world or that we shun and abstain from the things of the world. When the Lord said that He was not of this world, He meant that He did not come out of this world, and therefore, His attendants did not need to struggle for Him. If His kingdom was out of this world, His attendants would have needed to fight. Since His kingdom is out of God and from above, there was no need to fight and no need of any fleshly weapon.</p><p>Some of God's children are concerned only with the outward, physical world. They think that being not of this world is being careful with material things, that is, to turn away from and be less involved with worldly things. Christians reject outward, worldly sins and defilements, but disguised worldliness is often neglected by them. There are many terms which are taken from the Bible, but if you trace  man's use of these terms, you will find that they are out of the world. Many so-called virtues, such as patience and humility, are out of the world when their source is traced. Why does a person allow others to mistreat him? It is because he will be despised if he does not restrain himself. Why does a person try to be nice? It is because he is afraid of being misunderstood. Such acts are of the world. Many so-called virtues are the result of worldly apprehensions.</p><h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL REALITY</h2><p>If a man keeps asking what the Body is, what the natural life is, or what the church is, this only proves that he is still in darkness. He does not have light in his spirit, and he has not received revelation. Man likes to have absolute definitions and explanations for all kinds of truths. However, one who has touched spiritual reality in a genuine way does not need to ask all these questions, because he fully understands in his spirit. You do not have to ask who Watchman Nee is, and you do not have to spend time to study him. All you have to do is to come and ask me, and you will know. Once a person knows the church and the Body, there is no need for him to study definitions or ask so many questions.</p><p>The same is true with our testimony. If a man truly understands what our testimony is, he will not need a definition. It is difficult to give absolute definitions to spiritual things in any case. We can tell others about a doctrine that is related to our testimony, but the reality of the testimony can only come with the inward revelation of the Holy Spirit. The same is true with our preaching. Without the revelation of the Holy Spirit to convey spiritual things to us and without Him giving us the utterance, we will speak only doctrines and knowledge that contain no reality at all. A frequent temptation we face is using human words to explain divine truths and thinking that we can do this without the leading of the Spirit. But if this was indeed possible, why would there be the need for the Holy Spirit to come? A worker must yield to the Holy Spirit in his work, in his preaching, and in solving others' spiritual problems. He should allow the Spirit to have the absolute authority and the ground to work in others' spirit. It is useless to try to solve any problem through the mind or the intellect. We have to solve others' spiritual problems, but this must be done through the operation of the Spirit.</p><p>For a period of time I was quite unhappy with Miss Barber for taking a three-month summer vacation every year and spending two hours every afternoon on a walk. She asked me, "Do you think that I should take care of man's criticism, while ignoring God's will?" When I heard this, I worried about her, and thought that this was dangerous. I thought, "How can you say that everything you do is according to God's will?" But I also knew that she was a person who feared God. She wanted everything to be of God. She did not do anything carelessly, and she always carefully sought after God's will. Once she became clear concerning God's will, she would not care for any human feeling, concept, or criticism. Of course, a fleshly person has no place in this discussion. A fleshly person can say that he is afraid of no one, not even the church, the brothers and sisters, his parents, heaven, earth, or God. Such a one is actually living in complete darkness.</p><p>Once Miss Barber would not accept two hundred dollars from a professor (who appeared to be saved). She wrote a letter to him saying, "I cannot accept your money because you are associated with a university that does not resemble anything Christian." I thought that it was impolite for her to do this. But a man who fears God can be very tough and at the same time be very humble. What matters is whether or not he fears God and knows His will.</p><p>The Bible is the most peculiar book in the world because there are many things in it that can lead to misunderstandings. But God does not worry about this, and He does not put footnotes to any of the words. When Brother Austin-Sparks speaks, he may speak for an hour and a half. If he wanted to clarify and elaborate on the things that he spoke, he could go on for another hour and a half. But he does not do this. A renowned Chinese seminary professor once told me that a young seminary student was very spiritual. I asked what he meant. He said that during the first year of the young man's marriage, he did not say one word to his wife whenever he was home. I thought to myself: If I were Peter and I was charged to guard the gate of heaven (not that Peter is actually standing at the gate of heaven), I would stop this man from coming into the gate. I would ask him to go home and speak to his wife before I would admit him. This person was not spiritual at all. Being spiritual does not mean that we are no longer human; it means having the authority of the Spirit, giving place to the Spirit, and manifesting the Spirit through us.</p><p>Today men's concept of the world is too low. The testimony of Christ is that He is not of this world (John 18:36). This means that He has rejected everything that has its source in the world, no matter how spiritual it may look outwardly. Being not of the world does not mean that we do not touch the things of the world and that we shun the affairs of the world. It means that the source is not the world. It means shutting out all human effort, improvement, good works, virtues, and everything that is not of the Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">THE VERDICT OF DEATH</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: November 18, 1941<br />Place: 7 Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br />Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:8-10</h1><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE NATURAL LIFE</h2><p>We must realize that a Christian possesses everything that he should receive at the time of his regeneration. Through regeneration a Christian receives a new life. God does not mend the natural life; He does not repair the old life. The natural life and the old life are the very sphere of the cross's operation. God's intention is to give the natural life and the old life a fundamental and final blow.</p><p>Esau was a sinner who was moral, whereas Jacob was a supplanter who feared God. He wanted spiritual blessings and God's presence but was very natural. He did not deny himself, and his maneuvering, energy, and cleverness were always with him. This is why God had to give him a fundamental blow at Peniel. Any blow from God that allows us to resume our former condition cannot be considered a fundamental blow.</p><p>Jacob sought for blessing, yet he had to flee. He wanted to be the firstborn, yet he had to leave his family and parents. After God touched the hollow of his thigh at Peniel, he became lame forever. From that point on, he limped whenever he moved. The strength of his natural life was thoroughly dealt with by God. Many people receive revelation and light after they have been dealt with. But the degree of the power that is produced from this touch depends on how deeply God has touched us. We need God's light to expose our true nature. Once it is exposed, we are no longer able to return to or recover our old condition. This is what we mean by a fundamental blow. A fundamental dealing means that there is no returning to our former condition.</p><h2 class="head1">THE VERDICT OF DEATH</h2><p>Everyone has to pass through death. As soon as a man is born, he is heading in the direction of death. But before death actually comes to a man, he may not feel the power of death. He may never have thought of death until a doctor tells him that he is terminally ill with tuberculosis. Then there is an immediate "verdict of death." This does not mean that there was no death prior to this point. It merely means that he did not see the imminence and reality of death. But when he sees it, he is crushed. Many people know the doctrine of the cross, and they can even preach it. Nevertheless, the cross is a fuzzy subject to them. But once God touches them and they hear the verdict of death, the cross becomes real to them. Once God touches a man, he becomes crippled. Lameness is a mark of God's drastic operation on man.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S DOCTRINES VERSUS GOD'S LIGHT</h2><p>There is a great difference between God's doctrines and God's light. Jacob met God; he was touched by Him, dealt with by Him, and became lame. Acting lame does not work. Those who act lame may limp when they think about it, but when they are fighting to get on a bus, they forget about their "lameness." This kind of "lameness" is only a change in conduct; it is not a change in life. Those who are truly lame can do nothing but limp. Neither those who are running nor those who are pretending to be lame have been touched by God. God's children today are filled with behavior because podiums are filled with doctrines, and doctrines produce nothing but artificial behavior.</p><p>I have seen God crippling men who were quite strong, and I believe that He can cripple us too. He will take away our confidence in ourselves so that we will no longer trust in ourselves. This is the verdict of death. A day will come when God will deal with us in a severe way. He will pronounce a verdict of death on us. Then we will be able to say that everything is of God. What we have today is not of God, and what we had before was not of God. But when we are touched this way, our denial of the self will be spontaneous, and our prayer will flow out in a most unpretentious way. Those who are touched by God do not need to set anything to memory. Those who are truly lame may forget about their lameness, but as soon as they take a step and try to walk as others do, they find that they are crippled. They fall at the first step. Our mind may forget that we are lame, but our legs will never forget that we are lame. The cross is God's greatest destruction; it has destroyed the whole old creation. This destruction comes from the operation of light, and this drastic work forever removes any hope of recovery.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE VERDICT OF DEATH</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: November 20, 1941<br />Place: 7 Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br />Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:8-10</h1><h2 class="head1">DOCTRINE VERSUS LIGHT</h2><p>The verdict of death that we are speaking of here does not refer to death itself; rather, it refers to the reality, inevitability, and unavoidability of the work of death in man. This verdict removes man's trust in himself and turns him to God alone. But we have two questions: How do we know whether we have received this light, and how do we know whether God has done this work in us? We have to know what is doctrine and what is light. If someone tells us about something and then we have to do it ourselves, we have received a doctrine. But when revelation and light touches us, it produces an immediate effect. For example, if the doctor says that you are seriously sick, he will immediately take you to the operation room. God's word is powerful, because when He says, "Let there be light," there is light. God does not say, "Let there be light," and then ask us to go and find light or create light. It is a characteristic of spiritual things that as soon as God says something, it is done. We do not have to worry about how God does a work; we only need to worry whether God has spoken. It is wrong for the ears to pick up something and for the hands to try to act upon it. As soon as Paul saw God's great light, he asked, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" (Acts 9:6, KJV). God did not preach to him, yet he was able to ask such a question. Much of our problem lies in the fact that we do not know what we should do. There is no short cut, and no doctrine can substitute for light.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHARACTERISTIC OF LIGHT</h2><p>A brother from Mongolia once stayed in Shanghai for eight months. When he was ready to leave, he asked me to lay hands on him and to send him out for the work. I did not do it. Later he went to Tientsin and wrote a letter to me telling me all the things he had seen while he was in Shanghai. After I read the letter, I became very angry and tore the letter apart. I said in my heart, "What do you really know?" If someone says that he has fallen from a seven-story building and tells you exactly what was going on every second during the fall, he must be lying. The most skillful liars will say the same thing every time. Paul related his story three times, and every time it was different. This is because the light confused him. Before he received the light, he was able to ride a horse; but afterwards, he could only proceed by allowing others to hold his hand. He could no longer tell the east from the west or the north from the south. One characteristic of being enlightened is becoming unclear. Abraham's virtue rested in his ignorance; he could not do anything but wait for God's instructions. The first result of all spiritual revelation is confusion. This is absolutely opposite to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil makes one clear. But one begins to trust in God when he is in a state of confusion.</p><h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL FACTS</h2><p>Spiritual matters have nothing to do with doctrines; they have to do with facts. Mental apprehension, anxiety, or concern have no place in spiritual things. What counts are the facts. All that matters is whether or not there are the facts. The more a person asks questions, the more it proves that he is in darkness. When a man has the light, he will see. He sees because he is in the light. All problems will go away when he sees. But if he does not have the light, he will ask all kinds of questions. He will ask about the color or shape of an object. But these questions will disappear once he has the light and sees. Spiritual confusion does not lead to doubt, but doctrines lead to questionings. We need a fundamental dealing, a genuine shining, and a thorough blow from the cross. Only the verdict of death will result in the genuine denial of the self; only then will we trust in God, not in ourselves.</p></body></html>
