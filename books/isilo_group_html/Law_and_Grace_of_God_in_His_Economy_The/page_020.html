The Processed Triune God, Consummated as the All-inclusive, Life-giving, Compound, and Indwelling Spirit, Becoming the Spirit of Grace</h2><p>The processed Triune God, who has been consummated as the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound, and indwelling Spirit, becomes the Spirit of grace (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rev. 22:17a; Heb. 10:29).</p><h2 class="head3">1. In the New Testament Age<br />the Spirit of Grace Dispensing the Triune God<br />into the Believers as Grace</h2><p>In the New Testament age the Spirit of grace dispenses the Triune God into the believers as grace. Since the Spirit of grace dispenses the Triune God into us to be our grace, our Christian life is essentially a life of having God as our grace.</p><h2 class="head3">2. At the End of the New Testament Age<br />the Spirit of Grace<br />Causing the Whole House<br />of Israel to Repent and Receive<br />the Triune God as Grace</h2><p>At the end of the New Testament age, the Spirit of grace will cause the whole house of Israel to repent and receive the Triune God as grace. Zechariah 12:10 says that God will pour out the Spirit of grace upon the remnant of Israel that the whole house of Israel may repent and be saved.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Compound, Life-giving Spirit<br />and the Believers&rsquo; Regenerated Spirit<br />Becoming One Mingled Spirit</h2><p>The compound, life-giving Spirit and the believers&rsquo; regenerated spirit become one mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4b-6), not only united but also mingled.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Believers&rsquo; Living and Work<br />by the Spirit, Essentially and Economically,<br />Being Their Experience and Enjoyment<br />of the Pneumatic Christ, the Embodiment<br />of the Triune God, as Grace</h2><p>Both essentially and economically, that is, both in their living and in their moving, the believers&rsquo; living and work by the Spirit is the experience and enjoyment of the pneumatic Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, as grace (John 1:14, 16; Rev. 22:21).</p><p>The Triune God passed through a process from His being merely God without humanity to His entering into humanity and being mingled with humanity as one. Then He passed through human living and an all-inclusive death and entered into the all-producing resurrection, producing the firstborn Son of God, the many sons of God, and the life-giving Spirit. This One who was in resurrection also entered into ascension and became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who is typified by the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30:22-25. The holy anointing oil is the fragrant olive oil compounded with four kinds of spices. It is not merely oil but an ointment with various elements. This is a type of the compound Spirit, in whom are the Father and the Son with His all-inclusive death, His human living, His resurrection, and His ascension. Now the compound Spirit is moving within us daily as the anointing that we may enjoy the processed Triune God as grace. This is the life that we Christians should have today.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Law and Grace of God in His Economy &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
