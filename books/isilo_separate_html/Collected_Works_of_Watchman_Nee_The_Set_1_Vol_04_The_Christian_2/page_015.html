Here the apostle also mentions endurance. To those who know the future glory and who for its sake are willing to endure the tribulation, the most important thing is endurance. We know that to enter into the kingdom we must go through many difficulties. If we do not persevere with endurance, we may become those who put their hands on the plow but look backward. We may be counted unworthy by the Lord to enter into the kingdom of God. If by the Holy Spirit of God we would endure tribulation, ever accepting that which is new after that which is old is over, and faithfully allowing tribulation to treat us harshly, to hurt us, to afflict us, and to break us so that God can accomplish His perfect will, our next tribulation will find us with more strength to endure than before. This is because "tribulation works endurance" (Rom. 5:3).</P><P>If one grieves in his suffering, this suffering is in vain. Saints should be like the Lamb of God, who endured without a sound under the hands of the shearers. Our portion now is to suffer. Do not hope for something better than this. The virtue of a Christian in tribulation is endurance. If we endure, we will inherit the kingdom. "If we endure, we will also reign with Him" (2 Tim. 2:12). For this reason we should hold fast to what we have, that is, to endure, so that no one will take away our crown, that is, the future kingdom. "Therefore be long-suffering, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer eagerly awaits the precious fruit of the earth, exercising long-suffering over it until it receives the early and late rain. You also be long-suffering; establish your hearts because the coming of the Lord has drawn near" (James 5:7-8). Oh, many people have already lost this! At the beginning of the journey to the heavenly kingdom, were there not many people? What about now? I am afraid many have gone back to the world! At the beginning of the way of the cross, because of the future earnest hope of glory, many charge forward courageously. However, because of the Lord's delay, the change in time and environment, the attack of Satan, and the delusion of the world, the cross becomes heavy, the old flesh rises and falls, and finally they compromise with the people in the world and leave this narrow way. Truly, if the Lord were to come back earlier, would not all ten virgins have brightly shining lamps? However, the bridegroom delayed. Because of this delay, the line between the wise and the foolish was drawn. "Time" will manifest who has served the Lord faithfully and in whose life the work of the cross has been deeply wrought. Therefore, brothers, endure until the Lord comes. On the one hand, if we look at the signs now, we know the Lord is surely coming soon, but on the other hand, maybe the Lord will not come within ten years or a hundred years. If the Lord delays, can you endure suffering for Him that long, awaiting the manifestation of His kingdom? May we all keep the word of the Lord's endurance (Rev. 3:10).</P><P>Truly the kingdom is real, and the tribulation will be severe. Without endurance we will fail. The apostle put both things together. How meaningful this is! What God delights in is the saints' heart of endurance through their suffering for the kingdom. This matches what Paul said: "We ourselves boast in you...concerning your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions which you bear, a plain indication of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be accounted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you suffer" (2 Thes. 1:4-5). Endurance in suffering will definitely bring us the kingdom. Nevertheless, we should also remember that tribulation, kingdom, and endurance are "in Jesus." Suffering is not to secure one's own reward but is for the Lord Jesus Christ. Whatever is less than this standard will not gain God's delight. It is not up to us to choose how to suffer or what kind of suffering we should have. Everything is for the Lord Jesus! Everything is for the Lord Jesus! Besides Him, we have no interest. Only when the Holy Spirit works in our hearts, causing us to be filled with the will of and desire for the Lord Jesus, are we able to endure suffering for Him with joy.</P><P>Now is the time of "kingdom and endurance." In the future it will be the time of "power, kingdom, and authority." Before the Lord appears in glory, we must pass through suffering in endurance. Once the Lord appears in glory, our sufferings and endurance will cease. Oh blessed hope! Now Christ is waiting for the manifestation of His kingdom. He is waiting for God to make His enemies His footstool. We are enduring with the Lord, waiting for the fulfillment of this hope. Christ together with the Christians are rejected by the world; they hope and endure together and work together!</P><P>The church, however, has already left her position of endurance of tribulation. She desires to seek a place in the world and in society. She loves the glory and power of this life and despises the narrow way of the cross. The blessing of this world should be for the Jews and, consequent to their fall, for the Gentile world. However, here the church is also seeking after the greatness of the flesh. In the present time while many people fail, those who faithfully serve the Lord should all the more be sober. If we forsake sins, we should all the more be humble, for the one who suffers for the Lord, if he does not continue to rely upon Him, may think, "I serve the Lord this way, but no one else does!" If this is so, how can we say it is all by the Lord's grace? Here lies our danger. If one has God's grace to leave everything of the world but does not have the same grace to humble himself, the result is that his separation will become a source of boasting. Now we see the children of God failing on every side. On the one hand, we should depart from sin. On the other hand, we should recognize our failure and confess our sins before the Lord (Dan. 9). Being in an age where Satan constantly attacks God's children, now is not the time for us to boast of ourselves.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
