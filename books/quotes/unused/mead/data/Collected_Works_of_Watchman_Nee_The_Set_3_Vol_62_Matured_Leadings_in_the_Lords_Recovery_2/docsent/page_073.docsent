   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORK OF THE DEACONS' OFFICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING A BIBLICAL ONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Watchman Nee: First we need to ask if this kind of arrangement is scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Ma, Brother Chia, are we scriptural?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All those who know the Bible admit that this arrangement is according to the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acts 2:45 says that properties and possessions in the early church were "divided..to all, as anyone had need."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to divide to all according to need, there first had to be a survey and a census of all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only then could everyone's need be ascertained.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today it is a simple thing to read these few words.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But there were tens of thousands of believers in the church in Jerusalem at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How much arrangement and preparation work was needed to divide to all according their need?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Acts 6:1 tells us that trouble arose because of the neglect of the supply of a few widows.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church has to take care of many affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, there must be planning and arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible only gives us general principles for handling these affairs; it does not give us a detailed record.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is because things differ with age and background.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God does not want us to pay attention to the arrangement of practical affairs, but to men's spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God recognizes the need for arrangement, but He does not think that it is so important that all the details need to be recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He wants us to live before Him and receive His revelation and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a man is filled with the Holy Spirit, he will spontaneously know how to deal with spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 1 Timothy 5:9 we are told that the widows had to be enrolled in a register.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That is the only reference to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We only know that the widows were enrolled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As to what a register looks like, we have to go to the Lord and pray for wisdom and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God will not show us the description of the register in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If He did, it would be easy for us to carry out things, and we would not need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In feeding the multitude the Lord told the disciples to arrange the crowd in groups of fifties and hundreds Mark 6:39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The disciples learned from this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At Pentecost they were able to baptize three thousand and then five thousand, and then they were able to divide to all according to their needs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord trained the disciples personally; He did not write a manual of instructions for the disciples to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In writing the Bible, the apostles were detailed in describing spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As far as the arrangement of practical affairs was concerned, however, they only told us that there were such arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They did not tell us how these arrangements were made.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul wrote fourteen Epistles, but he did not write a single church manual.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In keeping a record of the saints, it is wrong to say that we need one book, and it is equally wrong to say that we need many books.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We only know that there is a principle of enrolling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As to how to enroll, we have to seek the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must not make decisions based on dead methods.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need a register because human memory is unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul knew that he would die; therefore, there was the need of a register.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the Holy Spirit has not left the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is still leading the church on in practical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to know of the need for a register, but we have to look to the leading of the Holy Spirit in preparing this register.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need the Holy Spirit to give us the wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Arrangements in the church are different from those in denominational organizations or in business institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They must be based on spiritual principles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everything we do must be biblical; we should not go to the extreme in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here we are not emphasizing a method of doing things, but a principle of doing them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even after we have a principle, we should still seek the leading of the Holy Spirit according to these principles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE GOAL OF ARRANGING PRACTICAL AFFAIRS</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today our arrangement of various practical affairs is for the purpose of training brothers and sisters to walk in an orderly and sober manner.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church is an institution, a Body in action.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It should absorb as many people as are presented to it, whether one hundred or one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to take care of all kinds of people, there is the need for suitable arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to have the capacity to absorb every person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If there are no arrangements in the church, there will be confusion when the number increases.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, arrangement is not our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is merely for the purpose of placing brothers and sisters in the right position of service so that the entire church can rise up to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The combined effect of the work of the deacons' office and of the various preparation works is like the logistic support of an army.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the whole church becomes the supply line, the power of the church will multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have not set up five or six items of service randomly; they have a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Through such arrangements the whole Body can serve and preach the gospel, and God can begin His recovery work on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By making these arrangements, we are making a way for the whole Body to rise up to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A FEW THINGS THE DEACONS SHOULD TAKE CARE OF</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I must speak in particular to the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You should not try to assume leadership in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You should only work as you are told.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whether or not the church service is pleasing to God depends not so much on the performance of your work as on your obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the church we must have love, and we must have authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May the Lord bless the church in Hong Kong and grant all of us grace to learn submission.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>May we all learn the spiritual principles so that the entire Body will learn to serve in coordination.</S>
