   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Word of Their Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second thing is that the brothers overcame him "because of the word of their testimony."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When our conscience is without offense, then our mouth can give testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When there is an accusation in our conscience, we can utter nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems that the more we speak, the lower our voice becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The meaning of testimony here is to testify to others, not to one's self.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you have the blood before God, you will have boldness before God, and you will have a testimony before man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only will you testify that sinners can be forgiven and man can be accepted because of Christ, but you will further testify of God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Testimony" means to tell others what there is in Christ, and the word of testimony is something which must be spoken forth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The overcomers must frequently proclaim the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Satan fears the most when this fact is repeated again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a fact that the kingdom of heaven will come; it is a fact that the Lord is King; it is a fact that Christ is victorious and forever victorious; it is a fact that Satan is defeated; it is a fact that the strong man has been bound and legally condemned; it is a fact that Christ has destroyed all the work of Satan on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we declare all of these facts, we have the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we proclaim that Christ is this and Christ is that, this is the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the word of testimony that gives Satan the greatest fear.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan does not fear when we try to reason with him, but he does fear when we proclaim the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Satan does not fear when we talk theology or when we expound the Scriptures, but he does fear when we declare the spiritual facts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Jesus is Lord" is a spiritual fact.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people speak about Jesus as the Lord and explain how Jesus is the Lord, but Satan is not afraid in the least.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when someone declares in faith that Jesus is Lord, Satan fears.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He does not fear our preaching or theology, but the word of our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a spiritual fact that the name of Jesus is above every other name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must declare it in faith, not only to men, but also to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We often speak for Satan to hear; we purposely speak for him to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We call this the word of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even when we are alone in our room we can proclaim aloud, "Jesus is Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can say, "The Lord Jesus is stronger than the strong man," or, "The Son of God has already bound Satan," etc. This is the word of our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christians must rely upon prayer in everything, but sometimes the word of our testimony is more effective than prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Mark 11:23 the Lord Jesus said, "Whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says happens, he will have it."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus did not say that what a person prays will come to pass, but that what a person says will come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Chinese have a proverb which says, "A composition can come immediately from one's mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But Christians can say, "An accomplishment can come immediately from one's mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God created the heavens and the earth by one word of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The incident in Mark 11 shows us that we can speak to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only if we speak in faith will something be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times the power of prayer is not as strong as the power of proclamation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many times we must use the word of testimony to deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we read the book of Acts, we can see many words of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In chapter three Peter and John saw the lame man at the gate of the temple, and what Peter did was to say to him, "Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is what is called the word of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not beseeching God to deal with the situation, but dealing with it directly in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Acts 16, when Paul cast out the demon, he also used the word of proclamation: "I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Immediately the demon came out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us further illustrate by relating a certain event.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There were two sisters who were engaged in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day they came to a certain village and stayed for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A woman who was possessed of a demon was there, and a member of her family invited the two sisters to go to her home to cast out the demon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After praying, they felt that they should go.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When they arrived, they saw that the woman was properly dressed and that everything was in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They wondered if the woman was really demon-possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then they preached to her, and she seemed to be quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually demons cannot be clear, but they pretend to be.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The two sisters felt very strange about the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They asked the woman, "Do you believe in the Lord Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She answered, "I have believed for many years."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Upon this reply, the two sisters were really confused; they did not know what to make of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then they asked her, "Do you know who Jesus is?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She said, "If you want to know who Jesus is, come and see."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then she led them from the front room to a room at the rear of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Pointing to an idol, she said, "This is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have believed in him for many years."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then one of the sisters felt that she must give a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Please note that what she said is the kind of testimony that we are talking about here.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The sister grasped the woman's hand and said not to the woman, but to the demon , "Do you remember that more than nineteen hundred years ago the Son of God came from heaven to become a man for thirty-three and a half years?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He cast out demons like you many times.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do you remember that you desired to attack and harm Him?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You and all of yours rose up to kill Him and nail Him to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You were very happy at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You did not know that He would rise from the dead after three days and break all your power.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You are but a wicked spirit under the hand of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do you remember that when the Son of God came out from Hades, God announced from heaven to all living creatures and to all spirits, The name of Jesus henceforth is above every name.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whenever His name is mentioned, every tongue must confess and every knee must bow.'</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>So I command you in the name of Jesus to come out from her!"</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When the sister made this proclamation, the demon cast the woman to the floor and left.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The sister's question, "Do you remember?" is of utmost significance.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Her repeated urging of that question was her testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we preach to Satan, he also can preach, and he can do quite a bit of it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we reason with him, he has all kinds of reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But if we speak the facts, especially the spiritual facts, Satan will be helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must know the facts in the Scriptures and believe them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must be covered by the blood so that God may protect us from all the attacks of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then we may speak to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Satan fears when we speak the word of testimony to him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In our Christian experience, we sometimes feel so weak that we cannot even pray to God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>At such a time we must remember the spiritual facts, the victorious facts.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must proclaim to Satan and his demons that the Lord Jesus is victorious and that Jesus is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Such a proclamation is the testimony, and the testimony is the proclamation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What do we proclaim?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We proclaim that Jesus is Lord, that the Lord is victorious, that Satan has been trodden under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We further proclaim that the Lord has given us authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is the word of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The word of testimony causes Satan to lose his ground.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When we give the word of testimony, we give Satan a blow.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The work of the Lord has not only given us the blood to protect us, but also the word of testimony by which we can defeat Satan.</S>
