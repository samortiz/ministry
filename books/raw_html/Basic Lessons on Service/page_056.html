<H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) Unleavened, Hollow Wafers Anointed with Oil&#151;<br>Christ Living a Humble Life<br>under the Anointing of the Spirit</H2><P>The second kind of cake is the unleavened, hollow wafers anointed with oil (Lev. 7:12b). The Lord in His human life on this earth was very hollow, which means that He was poor in spirit; He was humble (Phil. 2:7-8). He lived such a humble life under the anointing of the Spirit. The mingling of the Spirit was within Him, and the anointing of the Spirit was upon Him.</P><P>In the four Gospels, we can see these two aspects of the Lord Jesus' life. His life was on the one hand mingled with the Spirit. When He was twelve years old in the temple, we can see the mingling within Him but not the anointing upon Him (Luke 2:40-52). But in Luke 4 we can see the anointing. In verse 18 the Lord quoted from the book of Isaiah: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me.." (Isa. 61:1-2). By reading the four Gospels, we can see that some instances of the Lord's life show a life mingled with the Spirit and others show a life under the anointing of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) Cakes of Fine Flour Saturated and Mingled with Oil&#151;<br>Christ Living a Fine Human Life Saturated<br>and Mingled with the Spirit</H2><P>The fine flour always signifies the Lord's fine and balanced human life. It was so even; it was not coarse or unbalanced. His human life is composed of and is constituted with the element of fine flour. These cakes of fine flour were saturated and mingled with oil (Lev. 7:12c). Being saturated is deeper than being mingled. You may have something mingled and yet it may not be saturated. The anointing is without, the mingling is within, and the saturating is the soaking and penetrating of the oil into the fine flour. This shows us how detailed the Bible is. The anointing, mingling, and saturating tell us that the Lord's human living on this earth was not only outwardly under the Spirit but also mingled with the Spirit to the extent that His whole human element was saturated and soaked with the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>4) Leavened Bread, Signifying the Sinfulness of the Offerer and the Offering Priest as a Reminder to Them</H2><P>Leviticus 7:13 says, "With the thanksgiving sacrifice of his peace offering, he shall offer his offering with cakes of leavened bread." The leavened bread here according to typology is a reminder that both the offerer and the conducting priest are still sinful.</P>
