Through God's marvelous leading, Brother Hua Tien-min and Brother She Fei-wu came to the city of Xinchang. (They were arrested while they were meeting in Fangkou and were brought to the jail here. When we heard this, we bailed them out on the same day.) These brothers supplied us with some truth. Then Brother Yu Cheng-hua came for several meetings and gave us much precious light. As a result of these meetings, we began to meet in the Lord's name in May and began to walk together with the children of God in the way of the service in His house. The Lord gave us special grace in July by sending Brother David Hsu to Xinchang for four days of fellowship, and the brothers and sisters were helped to see the Lord Himself. We started the table on the Lord's Day, September 24, and began to break bread to remember the Lord. There was a total of twenty-seven, including nine brothers and sisters who had been newly baptized. (Several brothers and sisters gradually have been added.) Everything directs us to His presence and His glorious light, but we are so young and weak! For this reason we are sincerely and fearfully sending you this letter to plead with you, who have also received grace and are at the frontline of God's churches and saints, to uphold us with your prayers and to give us deep and long fellowship. We do this with the hope that we could be built up with you as God's dwelling place and as members one of another to manifest the testimony of the oneness of Christ's Body. Honor, glory, and authority to His name forever! Amen.</p><p>For the brothers in the church in Xinchang,<br />Wu Huan-ting, Yu Cheng-rong, Lu Ting-zhen<br />October 1, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: Baoli Clinic, Xinchang</p><h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel in One Accord<br />(Sheng County)</h2><p>Since you left Sheng county, those with a heart to serve God have been strengthened by the light they have seen. They are not as easily influenced and led astray as in the past. After we preached the gospel in one accord to the outsiders, the number of inquirers increased to more than twenty. More than ten will be baptized next Lord's Day. Some did not receive the light, but instead hated it; they have joined others in slandering us. Through the shining of the light, though some were stumbled, others were revived. This is just like the situation the Lord faced when He was on the earth. The brothers can only respond with silence. We hope that the number of saved ones increases.</p><p>In the future, we will tell you of our pitiful condition, and hope that you will give us the Lord's word in exhortation.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chou En-ci<br />August 26</p><p>Mailing Address: Christian Meeting Hall, Si-Chien Street, Sheng county, Chekiang province</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_104.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_106.html">Next</a> </body></html>
