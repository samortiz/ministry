 <h2 class="head1">THE WHEEL WITHIN THE WHEEL&mdash;<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE IN OUR MOVE</h2>
<p>The greatest revelation in Ezekiel 1 is the wheel within the wheel (vv. 15-16). The book we have published entitled <em>The Visions of Ezekiel</em> covers this revelation (see chapter six). A wheel is something for moving. The Lord&rsquo;s move and our move are both signified by a wheel. The wheel within the wheel is the Lord&rsquo;s move in our move. When God&rsquo;s people move, God moves. If God&rsquo;s people do not move, God has no way to move.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THE WORLD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Europe Having Been Formed into One Situation</h2>
<p>Our eyes need to be opened to see the present situation of the world. Today Europe has been formed into one situation. A tunnel across the English Channel from England to France has recently been cut through. England and France are both members of the European Common Market. The European Common Market is composed of twelve countries, and these countries will eventually have a common currency. Furthermore, the people of these countries will eventually have a common passport, making travel among these countries so easy.</p>
<p>The Bible prophesies that ten kingdoms will be joined together under the Antichrist in the revived Roman Empire in Europe (Rev. 17:12). The Common Market is very similar to that coming kingdom. These nations in the European Common Market will also have a common language. This language will probably be English.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Russia Having Been Formed into One Situation</h2>
<p>The countries of Europe have been joined together into one situation, leaving Russia out. In today&rsquo;s world, Russia has been formed into one situation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Arab Countries Having Been Formed<br />
into One Situation against Israel</h2>
<p>The Arab countries have also been formed into one situation against Israel. God&rsquo;s heart is for building up Israel, but the plot of the Arab countries is to destroy it. Through the recent war involving Iraq in the Middle East, Israel has been profited, and the opposing Arab countries have been put down. The result of the four-day, four-hour war was that Israel gained the benefit. The United States protected Israel, even begged Israel not to fight, and told Israel that they would do the fighting. This situation is unique in human history.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Far East Countries<br />
Having Been Formed into One Situation</h2>
<p>The Far East countries have also been formed into one situation. The countries of Taiwan, Japan, and Korea are consumed with making money. Much of their money is made through their relationship with the United States.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The United States Standing<br />
as a Particular Situation That Is Friendly<br />
with Every Situation, Especially with Israel</h2>
<p>The United States stands as a particular situation that is friendly with every situation, especially with Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INFLUENTIAL FACTORS<br />
OF THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THE WORLD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The United States Taking the Lead<br />
in Finance, Politics, and Military</h2>
<p>Now we need to point out the influential factors of the present situation of the world. Who runs the entire world today? First, the United States takes the lead in finance, politics, and military. The weapons and the strategy used by the United States in the war with Iraq were all new. After this four-day, four-hour war, the whole world was convinced and subdued by the United States. Russia has been the second super power, competing with the United States. But today Russia is in a terrible economic crisis, and now they are begging for financial help to buy their food.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Europe Cooperating<br />
in Finance, Politics, and Military</h2>
<p>Europe is the second influential factor of the world&rsquo;s present situation. Europe cooperates with the United States in finance, politics, and military. England especially takes the lead to cooperate with the United States in everything.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Far East Cooperating Mainly in Finance</h2>
<p>The Far East is the third influential factor. The nations of the Far East cooperate with the United States mainly in finance. Japan especially has made much money in its economic relationship with the United States. Taiwan and Korea have also profited greatly in this way. Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the overseas Chinese may be considered as &ldquo;five Chinas.&rdquo; The people in these areas are mainly concerned with prospering in finance.</p>
