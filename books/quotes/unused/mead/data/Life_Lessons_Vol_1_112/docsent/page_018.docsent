   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not long before the Lord was sentenced to death on the cross by the Roman governor, the Roman Empire had adopted crucifixion as the form of execution for the most evil persons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, when the Jews sought to kill the Lord, they crucified Him through the hands of the Roman governor, fulfilling God's prophecy in Deuteronomy 21:23 concerning how the Lord would die.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the first three hours, God did not punish Him in the sinners' place; it was men persecuting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In these three hours, He suffered for martyrdom, not redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At noon, the earth became dark.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From this point until three o'clock, it was not men persecuting Him but God judging Him in the sinners' place.</S>
