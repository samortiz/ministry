<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The False Prophecy<br>of Israel's Prophets, Diviners,<br>Dreamers, Soothsayers, and Sorcerers</H2><P>In this chapter we also have the false prophecy of Israel's prophets, diviners, dreamers, soothsayers, and sorcerers (vv. 9-10). The diviners, the soothsayers, and the sorcerers practiced witchcraft, contacting demons. They were demonic persons, not in the sense of being demon possessed but in the sense of having regular contact with demons. Instead of contacting God, they continually contacted an evil, demonic source. This was the way they lived.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Saying That Israel<br>Will Not Serve the King of Babylon</H2><P>The false prophecy given by these prophets, diviners, dreamers, soothsayers, and sorcerers was that Israel would not serve the king of Babylon (vv. 9, 14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Result<br>of Their False Prophecy</H2><P>They prophesied falsely with the result that Israel would be removed far from their land. Jehovah would drive them out, and they would perish (v. 10). "For I have not sent them, declares Jehovah; but they prophesy falsely in My name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you" (v. 15).</P>
