   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING GOD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s word is also the power of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s word needs us to speak it forth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, if we have not learned to properly study the word of God, we will have no way to speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Fifty-five years ago I was called by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I had the burden to minister the word for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, as soon as I opened my mouth, I felt my lack of words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I could speak no more than two sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I could only say that it is wonderful to believe in Jesus; I did not know what else to say.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This forced me to diligently read through the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I read more and more, and as a result I have a more thorough understanding of the word, and I also have more to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The publications in the Lord s recovery today are not poor as were publications sixty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, they have already been translated into many different languages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are enough messages for you to read for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, you cannot make the excuse that you do not understand or do not know how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you want to understand, you need to go read.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once you read, you have to speak; and the more you speak, the clearer it will be.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every time I have released a message, it has been the case that the more I spoke, the clearer it got.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is the same with writing the footnotes of the Recovery Version; the more I write, the more light I receive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As spirit and life, the Lord s word is power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible says that no word from God shall be void of power Luke 1:37 ASV , and those who hear the word of the Lord will live John 5:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you preach the gospel, you have to preach the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You cannot merely tell people that it is wonderful to believe in Jesus and that our church is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more you say that, the less interested they will be.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to give the Lord s word to them to convince them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, you have to learn to speak the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord has truly given us great mercy by unveiling His word completely to us and allowing us to publish what we have seen so that we can study it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, today the Spirit is here, and the word is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to pray with the Spirit, and we also need to preach the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we continue to pray with the Spirit and preach the word, we will become crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Reading books on philosophy can never cause us to be crazy; but as soon as we read God s word, we will become crazy from within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have read the writings of Confucius, and I did not become crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While reading the Lord s word, however, I often have become abundantly excited with an indescribable joy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is because there is no spirit in Confucius s books, but there is spirit in the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord said that the words which He has spoken to us are spirit and are life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not read the Lord s word, His word will be stationary, not moving or jumping.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, as soon as we read the Lord s word, it will start to move within us, causing us to start moving as well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There was a co-worker among us named Luan Hong-bin, who was from Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Formerly he was involved in politics and therefore greatly despised and opposed Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He thought that only those Chinese who could not support themselves would turn to a Western religion for help and that any Chinese with integrity would not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One day while he was on a hill, he entered into a temple and saw an open Bible on the table of sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even though he did not like Christianity, he was still curious to find out what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He looked, and it was open to Psalm 1: Blessed is the man / Who does not walk / In the counsel of the wicked, / Nor stand on the path of sinners, / Nor sit in the seat of mockers v. 1 . He thought this was interesting, so he read on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, he was captured by the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He rolled on the floor, cried in confession, repented, and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later on, he became a good co-worker and changed his name to Philip Luan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One time when I was in Brother Nee s training in Shanghai, I stayed in the same room with him, and he told me this story in person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is another story that I can never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There was once an American who went to Africa on business.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He saw a local African sitting beneath a tree reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This American man thought of himself as one who was modern and understood science, so he despised religion and considered it superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said to the man in a disdaining tone, Do you still read the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The man answered and said, Sir, if I had not been reading the Bible and if the words of the Bible had not entered into me, I would have eaten you, and you would right now be in my stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This illustrates the power of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I studied the matter of speaking in tongues fifty years ago, and I also joined that kind of activity for more than a year.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Later, I did not speak in tongues anymore, and I advised others not to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After a few years, when I was in my hometown, Chefoo, not far from the meeting hall there was a Pentecostal church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The responsible brother there had a good relationship with me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One day that brother came to visit me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He wanted me to speak in tongues again, to be in the same flow with him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I asked him to sit down, and with a very serious tone, I said to him, Brother, I do not speak in tongues now, and I will not take that way of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today I will speak to you openly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Is your preaching more powerful, or is mine?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have been working here for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Who is making the greater profit?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Is it you or I?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The more you preach, the fewer people you have there.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The more I preach, the more people we have here.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Where is your power?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He said, Brother Lee, if you put it this way, I have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I admit I have not been as successful you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet I have to speak in tongues because if I do not speak in tongues, I have no power.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I then said, If this is the case, then go and speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The more you speak, the less powerful you will be.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, I will not speak in tongues, and the more I will not speak, the more powerful I will become.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I spoke such words not only to this person but also to others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Later on I also spoke the same words in Taiwan and in America.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Sometimes I would say, You speak in tongues, but where is the fruit of your work?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Where is the effectiveness of your work?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I dare not say that I have much fruit for my work, but my fruit is at least more than yours.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, speaking in tongues does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I do not speak a single phrase of tongues, but I have gained a great number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>At the end, many who spoke in tongues all had to concede defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The secret of my work is not in speaking in tongues but in praying with the Spirit and preaching the word.</S>
