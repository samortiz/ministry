<h1 class="title">KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 John 5:12, 13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The meaning of eternal life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Eternal life is life that is eternal.</li>
	<li>Eternal life is God&rsquo;s life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Eternal life is in the Son of God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God put His eternal life into His Son.</li>
	<li>He that has the Son of God has eternal life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The proof of having eternal life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>You can know whether you have eternal life. <em>Emphasize that it is wrong if one does not know whether he has eternal life.</em></li>
	<li>The words of the Bible prove that we have eternal life. Here it says, &ldquo;These things have I written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life...&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Based upon the words of the Bible, one should know that he has eternal life.</li>
	<li>If one does not believe in God&rsquo;s word, he makes God a liar.</li>
	<li>We should reject our own feeling rather than disbelieve the words of the Bible; we should distrust ourselves rather than make God a liar.</li>
	</ol></li>
