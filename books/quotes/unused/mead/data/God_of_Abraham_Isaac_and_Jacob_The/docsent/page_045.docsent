   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>According to typology, Isaac indeed typified the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But what kind of experiences did Isaac have?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can say that Isaac's experiences were all very common.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Unlike Abraham, who did many things which had never been done before, Isaac only did what others had already accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Abraham was truly the father, while Isaac was truly the son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Genesis 21 Ishmael was mocking on the day Isaac was weaned, but we do not see any record of what Isaac did when he was young.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Abraham put the wood for the burnt offering on him, he did not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Abraham bound him and laid him on the altar upon the wood, he did not say anything either.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He went wherever his father told him to go and did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At such a critical moment, he only said, "Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>22:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Genesis 23 his mother died, and in chapter twenty-four his father found a wife for him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not make any decisions, and he did not do anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He had nothing of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When he was sixty years old, he had two sons, which was not unusual, because Abraham also had two sons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God commanded Abraham to cast out the first son and put the second son on the altar, but He did not command Isaac to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although God loved Jacob and hated Esau Mal 1:2-3 , He did not ask Isaac to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Abraham experienced a famine in Canaan, and Isaac also experienced a famine in Canaan Gen 12:10; 26:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the famine came, Abraham went down to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While he was there he told others that his wife was his sister.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the end he was rebuked by Pharaoh 12:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although Isaac did not go down to Egypt when the famine came, he went down to Gerar.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He also said that his wife was his sister.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the end he was rebuked by Abimelech 26:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, Isaac dug some wells, but the wells that he dug were those that his father had dug when he was alive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After his father died, the Philistines covered up the wells, and Isaac opened them up again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He called them by the same name that his father had called them v. 18 . After he died, he was buried in his father's grave.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even his grave was prepared by his father 49:30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the history of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to learn the lesson of knowing God as the Son from these experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not only do we have to know God as the Father, but we have to know Christ as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is the meaning of God as the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It means that everything is received and nothing is initiated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Abraham we see God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Isaac we see God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Abraham we see the standard which God requires of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Isaac we see the life which enables God's people to reach that standard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many Christians have one basic problem: They only see God's purpose but do not see God's provisions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They see God's standard but do not see God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They see God's demands, but do not see the power that meets these demands.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is why we have to consider Isaac as well as Abraham.</S>
