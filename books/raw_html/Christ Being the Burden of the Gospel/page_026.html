<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S WONDERFUL WAY OF<br />
SALVATION FOR MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:16; 1 Pet. 2:24; Gal. 2:20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THREE STEPS OF GOD&rsquo;S WONDERFUL WAY<br />
OF SALVATION TO MAN</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He [God] who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; First Peter 2:24 says, &ldquo;Who [Christ] Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose bruise you were healed.&rdquo; Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three verses quoted above reveal the steps of God&rsquo;s way of salvation to man. First Timothy 3:16 speaks concerning God being manifested in the flesh. First Peter 2:24 speaks concerning the Lord Jesus bearing up our sins in His body on the cross, and Galatians 2:20 speaks concerning Christ living in us. God being manifested in the flesh, the Lord Jesus bearing our sins, and Christ living in us&mdash;these three matters fully reveal the three steps of God&rsquo;s way of salvation to man.</p>
<p>In previous chapters we saw man&rsquo;s actual condition: man is empty and sinful, his life is wicked and fragile, and he is wandering and lost. Man&rsquo;s condition reveals that he needs a way of salvation. Thus, many wise men, from ancient times to the present and from the East to the West, have considered how man can be saved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECAUSE OF HIS CONDITION MAN<br />
NEEDING SALVATION</h2>
<p>Throughout human history man has devised and invented many ways of salvation. The fact that so many ways of salvation have been invented indicates that because of his condition man needs salvation.</p>
<p>First, when we consider man&rsquo;s behavior, we must admit that man needs salvation. Our deeds are not proper, and our behavior is unrighteous. Although we often have a desire in our heart to do good, what we do outwardly is the opposite of what we desire inwardly. When we listen to the voice of our conscience, we are often condemned because of our fallen behavior. Such condemnation makes it clear that we are people who need to be saved.</p>
<p>Second, when we consider man&rsquo;s life, we find even more that we need to be saved. The more we have the desire to do good, the more we find that our nature is full of corruption. There is a Chinese proverb that says, &ldquo;Doing good is like climbing a mountain, but doing evil is like flowing water.&rdquo; This proverb describes how evil and corrupt our inward life is. As people with this kind of life, we certainly need to be saved.</p>
<p>Third, when we consider the meaning of human life, we realize that we need to be saved. Many people think that the human life does not have much meaning. Man always feels empty and is often discouraged because the human life is unpredictable and difficult. In northern China there is a saying that man&rsquo;s life consists only of &ldquo;three fillings and one lying down daily.&rdquo; This means that a person is filled by eating three meals a day and then lies down to sleep once at night. Thus, a person may ask whether these three fillings and one lying down are all that there is to the human life. He may ask whether man is merely a hanger for clothes and a container for food or whether man exists merely to have some enjoyment and be happy. Those who are thoughtful and full of feeling will consider whether this is the real meaning of human life, and they may sigh, saying, &ldquo;Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fourth, if we consider man&rsquo;s eternal destiny, we will conclude that man needs salvation. The universe has its laws, and heaven and earth have their governing principles. In our human living we have committed more sin than we have done good. Such a living violates the laws of the universe and revolts against the principles of heaven and earth. Thus, our end will not be a good end. Although many people are not excessively troubled at the time of their death, the Bible says that death is not the ultimate end, for after death comes judgment (Heb. 9:27). Since there are established laws and principles in the universe, it is certain that there will be a judgment on men, and since man&rsquo;s living has violated the laws and principles of the universe, it is certain that sinful man will be punished. The punishment that sinful man will suffer is eternal perdition (Rev. 20:15). Man&rsquo;s death in this age does not end his troubles. When a person dies, he passes from the temporary world into an eternal world. Whether his eternal destiny will be good or bad depends on his living today (v. 12). Judging from the way people conduct themselves during their life, it is certain that their eternal destiny will not be good. Therefore, from the perspective of our eternal destiny, we need salvation.</p>
