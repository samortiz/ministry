<h1 class="title">SEVERAL MATTERS REQUIRING ATTENTION<br />
IN THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIC PRINCIPLE IN THE SERVICE OF THE WORD<br />
BEING TO MINISTER GOD</h2>
<p>Those who serve in the ministry of the word need to supply the saints with God. Moreover, their words should be spirit and life and should pass through God and should have the experience in God. We must understand this basic matter in the ministry of the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLDING THE CENTRAL LINE<br />
REVEALED IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Since we minister the word to supply the saints, we must always hold the central line revealed in the Bible, which is God as life to man. No matter how many messages we give, how logical our messages are, or how many topics we cover, we should always focus on God as life. Regardless of how we preach the word, we should always take this as the center. Therefore, we need a clear vision of God being our life. We need to see how God becomes our life. We need to see how God the Son became flesh, died, resurrected, and brought all that He had obtained and attained into the Spirit to be man&rsquo;s life. Furthermore, God is now working in man to make man His counterpart, His dwelling place, His Body, as a vessel to express His glory.</p>
<p>If we lack the vision of the central line revealed in the Bible, our messages are winds of teaching. In other words, no matter how logical and eloquent our speaking may be, without this vision our message is a wind of teaching and belongs to the tree of knowledge. It will harm the saints and not benefit the church. Throughout the history of Christianity countless believers have been harmed and misdirected by winds of teaching. Most of what is preached in Christianity is harmful to people because it has delayed God. What the church needs the most is to echo the words of Peter, when he said, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life&rdquo; (John 6:68). When the Lord said to His disciples that His words are spirit and life (v. 63), many disciples left Him and no longer walked with Him. The Lord then asked the twelve disciples, &ldquo;Do you also want to go away?&rdquo; (v. 67). Peter rarely spoke sensibly when the Lord Jesus was living on the earth. However, this time he spoke clearly, and he said that the Lord had the words of eternal life. The church needs the words of eternal life, not any other kind of words.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking Life as the Center and<br />
the Controlling Factor</h2>
<p>The sixty-six books of the Bible include many teachings. Many things are spoken of in the Bible, including heaven and earth, God and man, males and females, masters and slaves, the garden of Eden and the New Jerusalem, the old testament and the new testament, and eternity past and eternity future. The Bible spans a period of over seven dispensations. Many things are recorded in the Bible. There is not another book that covers as many topics as the Bible. It was written by more than forty authors in over sixteen hundred years, that is, nearly two thousand years. The Bible is truly an all-inclusive book. However, we must see the vision of the New Jerusalem. We need to see that God and the Lamb are seated on a throne in the New Jerusalem. We also need to see the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne and the tree of life growing on both sides of the river (Rev. 22:1-2). Everything in the Bible focuses on this vision and is developed for this vision. God rules in His life; He rules by being man&rsquo;s life. This is the controlling factor.</p>
<p>Some may say that the saints need to be well-behaved, but this is only a result. It is not a source. We must show the saints that God needs to be our life in order for us to be proper. We may even speak about husbands loving their wives and about wives obeying their husbands, but if our speaking does not clearly present God as man&rsquo;s life, our exhortation belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It will not bear the fruit of the tree of life. We may also speak about serving in coordination. However, if we do not help others see that serving in coordination is the result of God being man&rsquo;s life, our teaching belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. There are only two trees in the universe, and we are either on one tree or the other tree. Anything that is not the issue of God being our life is man-made and belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>It is easy for believers to speak about the portions in Ephesians concerning human conduct, because it is easy to understand these portions. However, before speaking about human conduct, Paul says that we are in Christ (1:7), that Christ is in us (3:17), and that we are to be filled unto all the fullness of God (v. 19). He also says that the power of God operates in us (v. 20) and that we should walk worthily of the calling with which we were called (4:1). We need a deeper realization that God is in us and that He has called us to enjoy Him. God is for our enjoyment. This is the purpose of His calling us. God wants us to enjoy Him so that we would match Him.</p>
<p>God is in us; therefore, we should walk worthily of God. We should match Him. God lives in us, but a husband who mistreats his wife does not match God, who lives in him. Since God is in us as grace, our walk should be worthy of Him. In other words, we should let God live out of us. John 15:5 says, &ldquo;He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&rdquo; The love with which we love our wife should be the issue of Christ living in us. The fruit of our walk needs to be worthy of God, who indwells us. Our walk must match God. However, our understanding of Ephesians is that God is good to us, but if we are not proper in our walk, we will not be worthy of His calling. This understanding is according to the natural concept. The proper understanding is that since we are called by God and God indwells us, we should enjoy God so that we may match Him in our walk.</p>
<p>We know that God&rsquo;s calling is related to His being in us, because Ephesians 4 begins with the word <em>therefore.</em> This continues the thought of what is said in chapter 3. We need to walk worthily of the calling with which we were called, because Christ is making His home in our hearts through faith that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God. This means that because the God of fullness indwells us and operates in us, our walk should match Him. He operates in us so that we may love our wife. In this way we match Him. Our living is the working out of the inner operating God.</p>
<p>In addition to our walk, all our activities, our work, such as our service in coordination and our preaching the gospel, are the working out of the inner operating God. Our activities are the fruit of God being our life and living in us. God as our life is the unique subject and center of our messages. If we depart from this center, we have no way to speak. Every message we give that is apart from this center belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>It is difficult for some brothers and sisters to change their concept. Previously we said that prophets preach the tree of life and call people to enjoy God. Then a brother said that prophets also exhort people to leave evil and cling to good, that is, to do good instead of evil. We need to discern the source and the inward content of doing good. For example, what is the difference between a disciple of Confucius honoring his parents and a Christian honoring his parents? If we do not know the difference, we are not qualified to minister the word. The honor that a disciple of Confucius gives to his parents belongs to the good aspect of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but the proper honor that a Christian gives his parents is Christ. The prophets do not want people to do the good that belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Ephesians 2:10 says, &ldquo;We are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them.&rdquo; This verse shows that God has prepared good works for us to walk in. But there are two different sources of good works. When we are the source, the good works come from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. However, when God, who lives in man as his life, is the source, the good works within man come from the tree of life. Some believers are naturally zealous. Such zeal is from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Some believers are zealous, because God operates within them. This zeal is from the tree of life.</p>
