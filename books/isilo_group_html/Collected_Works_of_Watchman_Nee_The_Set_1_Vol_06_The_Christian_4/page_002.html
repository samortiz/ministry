This is a very important question! Salvation or perdition depends on whether or not you are at peace with God. If you are at peace with God, you are very secure because you have passed from death to life and received the blessing God has prepared in the Lord Jesus. But if you are not at peace with God, you are in a dangerous and pitiful condition because God's wrath abides upon you. How terrible this is! You should answer this question in an honest way. Are you at peace with God? You should not be careless or presumptuous. If you are at peace with God, you are at peace. If you are at enmity with God, you are at enmity. There is no middle ground. If you have not drawn nigh to God by the death of the Lord Jesus, you are God's enemy. The world is at enmity with God. Fighting against heaven is not the meaning of being at enmity with God; you do not have to fight against heaven to be at enmity with God. When you walk according to the flesh and ignore God's demand, caring only for living in your lusts, you are at enmity with God. The Bible says, "The mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be" (Rom. 8:7). A man does not have to purposely oppose God or rebel against Him in order to become an enemy of God. Dear readers, as long as you set your mind on the flesh, this is enmity against God. You may agree with religion, admire Christ, and help the church. All these things are good. But they do not indicate that you are not an enemy of God. As long as you set your mind on the flesh, it is enmity against God. When you set your mind on the flesh, you are not subject to the law of God, neither can you be. Setting the mind on the flesh is rebelling against God's law. How holy and righteous is God's law! Can you keep His law? How many times have you walked according to your flesh and the lusts of your flesh? How mild is the expression "the mind set on"! It does not require a rebellious act to be at enmity with Him; all that is required is a little private act of setting the mind on the flesh in the hidden part of your heart. This is enmity against God! Man not only disobeys God's law; he is even unable to submit to God's law. Man is corrupted in his very nature. Dear ones, do you know that your nature is corrupted? Many times you consider God's law to be good and upright, and you desire to keep it. But what is the result? You find that you cannot keep the law. It is impossible for you to keep the law. Although at times you may want to keep God's law, there seems to be a power within that forces you to set your mind on the flesh and break God's law. Your nature is corrupted; it is impossible for you to obey God's law. You must acknowledge that you are completely corrupted before God's salvation can come. Is it not true that there are many times when you do not want to indulge yourself in dissipation and wantonness? Then why do you fall into them again and again? Man's nature is corrupted. The world is at enmity with God, and you are included in this world!</P><P>Moreover, is it not true that your heart loves the world? Does praise of the world touch your heart? "Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever determines to be a friend of the world is constituted an enemy of God" (James 4:4). This is God's Word. An actual act of adultery is not necessary in order to become an adulterer in the Lord's eyes. The meaning of adultery is having a friendship with those whom you should not have a friendship. The world crucified the Lord Jesus. How can you be friendly with those who crucified the Lord and not be an enemy of God? Has the world changed? Is the world better than when Christ was on earth? If it is not, why are you fellowshipping with the world? Look at the lovely worldly people, the interesting worldly things, and the adorable worldly objects. You have established an inseparable bond with the world through its people, things, and objects. Therefore, you are an enemy of God. A man who is not at peace with God through regeneration is filled with the thoughts of people, things, and objects in the world all day long. He seeks after worldly fame, profit, and power. His face is toward the earth, and his back is turned against heaven. He ignores God's demand and is an enemy of God. Readers, have you been washed in the precious blood of the Lord? If you have not, and if you are a friend of the world, you are an enemy of God.</P><P>Your conduct is a great proof that you are an enemy of God. You do not do what God wants, and you do what God does not want. Daily you commit many sins. Your evil acts are an expression of your inward enmity. You are "alienated and enemies in your mind because of your evil works" (Col. 1:21). Evil works! Sins! Defilements! These are indelible evidences of man being at enmity with God. The Scripture says, "There is none righteous, not even one" (Rom. 3:10). No flesh can justify itself before God. No one in the world can be justified before God through his works. All the conduct of the world is evil work in the eyes of God. Although a great deal of behavior is acceptable before men, in God's eyes it is still full of defects and part of the "evil works." Does your conduct before God tell you that you are at enmity with Him? Do not think that you are better than others. You have to realize that there are many evil works such as pride, vainglory, and self-justification in all of the so-called good works! Please acknowledge your poor condition, and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. There is still the possibility of salvation. But if you are self-satisfied and self-contented, you will die in your sins. May the Holy Spirit convict you of sin, so that you will realize your true condition! Unless those in the world put themselves in the place of a sinner and acknowledge that they are enemies of God, they cannot receive God's grace. Unless men confess that they cannot please God and that their nature, desires, and conduct are contrary to God, they will not and cannot come to the cross to seek for God's salvation. Unless men realize that it is terrible to be an enemy of God, and unless they are aware of the coming eternal wrath, they may say that they believe in Christ, but their believing will not be a true believing. What is man? Is he not but a speck of dust? Is he not but a worm? How small a place does he occupy in the universe! What is there to boast in? Who is God? He is the Almighty. Heaven is His throne, and the earth is His footstool. Trying to speak of His greatness would exhaust a man's lifetime. For a little mortal to be an enemy of the great God is not only unfortunate, but unthinkable. Can the world escape perdition when it is at enmity with God? No. The Bible says, "The wrath of God abides upon him" (John 3:36). Therefore, do not be deceived. Do not think that your outward behavior is very good. You have to realize that it is a fatal thing to be "enemies in your mind" (Col 1:21). Do not think that it is a small thing to be at enmity with God. Nothing is worse than this.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 06: The Christian (4) &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
