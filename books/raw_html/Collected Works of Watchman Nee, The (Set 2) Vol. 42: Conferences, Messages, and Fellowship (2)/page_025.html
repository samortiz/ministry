<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">KNOWING CHRIST AND<br />THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: October 16, 1936, afternoon<br />Place: Amoy<br />Scripture Reading: Acts 1:8; Phil. 3:10</h1><h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE POWER OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION<br />FOR THE PURPOSE OF TESTIFYING FOR HIM</h2><p>The extent of the testimony we bear depends on the extent of our knowledge of Christ. No one can testify for the Lord without knowing Him. The extent of our knowledge of Christ determines the magnitude of the testimony we bear. Knowing Christ is knowing the power of His resurrection. When we know the power of His resurrection, we know Him. The knowledge of the power of His resurrection constitutes a major portion of our knowledge of Him. The power of the Holy Spirit is based upon resurrection. Without resurrection there cannot be the power of the Holy Spirit. We must know the power of Christ's resurrection before we can know Christ. The power of the Holy Spirit is for testifying for Christ, and the essence of our testimony is our knowledge of Him. The basis of our knowledge of Christ is the knowledge of the power of His resurrection. The essence of the power of the Holy Spirit is also the knowledge of the power of His resurrection. Only those who have received the power of the Holy Spirit and the power of resurrection can testify for the Lord. Those who do not know the power of resurrection are not qualified to bear His testimony.</p><p>This morning I want to ask an important question: Who among us is qualified to be a worker of Christ? Who is qualified to bear His testimony? The question is whether or not we know Christ and whether or not we know the power of His resurrection. It is easy to have the power of the Spirit, but having the power of the Spirit is not the goal. As long as we know the power of Christ's resurrection, the filling of the power of the Spirit will come spontaneously. The filling of the power of the Spirit is the result of knowing the power of Christ's resurrection. One should not consider the filling of the power of the Spirit to be the goal. Although it is good to be filled with the power of the Spirit, this is not our goal. When we know Christ, we will have a testimony and spontaneously have the power to testify. Once we know Christ and the power of His resurrection, our testimony for Him will become spontaneous.</p><h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />BEING BASED ON THE KNOWLEDGE<br />OF THE POWER OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION</h2><p>A testimony is not a doctrine; we cannot come up with a testimony from our mind. A testimony is also not a theology; it is not a biblical exposition of the gospel. We can only testify of the Christ whom we know. We cannot testify of Christ beyond what we know of Him. The measure of the Christ we know is the amount of the declaration we make before men and before God. It is impossible to have the power of witnessing in Acts 1:8 without the knowledge of Philippians 3:10. This can never happen. One must have the experience of Philippians 3:10 before he can have the power of Acts 1:8. Once we know Christ and the power of His resurrection, we will spontaneously testify for Christ and spontaneously have the power of the Holy Spirit. This may happen within a second. There is no need for us to exert any effort. In the twinkling of an eye, we will receive all these things. All these things are based on our knowledge of the power of resurrection.</p>
