   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WEIGHT OF THE LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>No measurement is given for the size of the lampstand, signifying that there is no measurement for the light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The light in the Holy Spirit is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may say, I saw a great light Matt 4:16 , but you cannot say how great the light was.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no measurement for the light, but there is a weight to the light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Exodus 37:24 says that the lampstand and its vessels were made of one talent of gold, which is close to one hundred pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With Christ as light to us there is no measurement, but there is always the weight.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we are in the light of Christ, the more we experience Christ as the light, the weightier we are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We know this by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we are in darkness, we are a very light person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But when we are in the light of Christ, we become a man of weight.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, we may refer to someone as a man of weight, a weighty person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the other hand, we may say of another person that he is too light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be too light simply means to be too much in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we are in darkness, the lighter we are.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No one in darkness is weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the more we are in the light of Christ, the weightier we are.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We become men of weight.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no measurement to the lampstand, but there is the weight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE TESTIMONY OF THE TABLE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>AND THE INCENSE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 25 says, And he made the altar of incense of acacia wood; a cubit was its length, and a cubit, its width, square; and two cubits, its height.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The incense altar was one cubit square and two cubits high.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is two units of a cube.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One cubit wide, one cubit long, and one cubit high forms a perfect cube, a perfect and complete whole.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nothing can be added and nothing can be subtracted from it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is perfect and complete, just like a cube.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is acceptable and pleasing to God because He is perfect and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You can never add anything to Him, and you can never take away anything from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The height of the incense altar being a cube doubled indicates that the incense altar is a testimony before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The altar of incense is a testimony before God, while the table of the bread of the Presence is a testimony toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The table was two cubits long and one cubit wide 37:10 , constituting two units of one square cubit each, placed next to each other horizontally.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The altar, on the other hand, was of two cubes placed vertically.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both the table and the altar were two cubits by one, but the table was doubled horizontally as a testimony to us, while the altar was doubled vertically as a testimony to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What Christ is as a testimony to us horizontally comes up to the standard of what Christ is as the testimony to God vertically.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The length of the table is the same as the height of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Both the table and the altar signify the one Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He comes to you as the table, He is horizontal, but when He goes to God as the incense, He is vertical.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A TESTIMONY OF COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Exodus 37:3-5 tells us that there were four rings in the Ark through which poles were placed so that it could be carried by four men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to verses 13 through 15 there were also four rings in the table of the bread of the Presence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, verse 27 says that two rings were placed under the crown of the altar for the same purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Ark and the table probably required four people to carry them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, it may have been that only two persons were required to carry the altar, since both its length and width were one cubit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The two poles in two rings could have been borne upon one man s two shoulders at either end. Nevertheless, at least the Ark and the table required four men to carry them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This points to the coordination of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On one side of the Ark and table were two rings, indicating a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A pole was placed through the two rings, and two men formed a group to bear the one side.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Another pole was on the other side within the two other rings, and another two men bore that side.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These two groups formed one group of four.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This signifies the coordination of the creatures to bear the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The four men had to be nearly the same size.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One could not be too tall or too short, lest they not be able to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They had to coordinate and walk together in the same steps 2 Cor 12:18b .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The table and, in principle, the incense altar, were borne in the same way as the Ark. Second Samuel 6 and 1 Chronicles 13 record how David brought the Ark to Jerusalem, not borne by men but upon a mule cart.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That displeased the Lord, and His anger was kindled 2 Sam 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From this David learned a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The next time the Ark was moved, David realized that the divine way to carry the Ark was not by a cart, but upon the shoulders of the Levites 1 Chron 15:2, 13-15 for the testimony of the Body.</S>
