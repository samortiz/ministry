   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE SEVEN WHAT KIND OF MAN MAY DWELL WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR HIS HEART'S DESIRE AND GOOD PLEASURE?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Psa 15 16</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we come to another pair of psalms, Psalms 15 and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that Psalms 1 and 2 were sovereignly arranged as a pair.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 1 says that the man whose delight is in the law of Jehovah is blessed vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psalm 2 says that the man who takes refuge in the Son is blessed v. 12 . Thus, we see the human concept of being blessed by the keeping of the law versus the divine concept of being blessed by taking refuge in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The comparison in Psalms 1 and 2 is between the law and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Psalms 15 and 16 also present a comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The end of Psalm 15 says, "He who does these things will not be shaken forever."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These things refer to the good things according to the law in the foregoing verses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the other hand, Psalm 16:8b says, "Because He is at My right hand, I shall not be shaken."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Psalm 15 says that if you do all the good things according to the law, you will never be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then Psalm 16 says concerning Christ that because God is at His right hand, He will not be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No doubt, Psalms 15 and 16 were arranged together to show us a comparison between the keeping of the law and the participating in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do we keep the law or do we partake of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do we keep the law or do we enjoy Christ as our portion?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At this point I would like us to read Psalms 15 and 16 together so that we can see the different concepts in these psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Afterward, we will cover them in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the beginning of Psalm 15, the psalmist asks, "O Jehovah, who may sojourn in Your tent?/Who may dwell on Your holy mountain?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The tent refers to God's house, the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>David says that this one is "He who walks in integrity/And does righteousness/And speaks truth from his heart./He does not slander with his tongue;/He does not do evil to his friend,/Nor does he take up reproach upon his neighbor./In his eyes a reprobate is despised,/But he honors those who fear Jehovah./Should he swear to his harm,/He does not change./He does not lend his money on interest,/Nor accept a bribe against the innocent./He who does these things will not be shaken forever" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This may seem like an excellent psalm, but actually it is a psalm in the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
