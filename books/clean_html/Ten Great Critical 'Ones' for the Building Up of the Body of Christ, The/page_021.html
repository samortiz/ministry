<h2 class=head2>Its Supply</h2><p>Its supply is the tree of life, signifying the all-inclusive Christ of life, growing on the two banks of the river of the water of life (22:2) and the river of the water of life, signifying the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit, flowing from the throne of the Lamb-God (22:1a).<h2 class=head2>The Wife of Christ</h2><p>The one city is the wife, the counterpart, of Christ who is the embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God (21:9b, 2).<h2 class=head2>Expressing the Unique Oneness of the Body of Christ</h2><p>Every part of this unique city expresses the unique oneness of the Body of Christ. Today our work for the Lord with its issue should be governed and directed by this pattern. What is unveiled in the vision of this unique city should be the model of what we are and how we work.<h2 class=head2>The Restored Nations</h2><p>The restored but not saved nations, the sheep, come from the judgment of Christ on His throne of glory, justified and sent by Him (Matt. 25:31-46) to be the people who are the subjects of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. The nations are the subjects ruled by the royal family, composed of Christ and His co-kings.<h2 class=head1>A CONCLUDING NOTE</h2><p>All of us, the co-workers and the elders, need to see the vision of these ten great critical “ones.” Every “one” should be a strong principle that directs, corrects, adjusts, and regulates us for the performing of the proper oneness of the Body of Christ today and the keeping of us on the right track of the Lord’s work, so that we will not be ashamed at the judgment seat of our Lord but rather be rewarded by Him for the participation in His kingship and priesthood in the kingdom.<p>These ten “ones” tell us that if we do not take the Lord’s way for the building up of the Body, we have no way. This means that if we are not in the recovery way, there is no way. In the New Jerusalem, there is only one way, one street. The one street makes us one with everyone. I must be faithful to present these ten “ones” to you and to let you know that this is the only way. There is no other way for the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>I believe that eventually the truths of the Lord’s recovery will conquer the theology of Christianity, and the revelation of the recovery will captivate all the seeking ones to be the overcomers. This will close this age and bring in the kingdom with its kings. We should present on the altar all that we are, all that we have, and all that we can do, praying, “Lord, I offer all to You for You to conquer Christianity by the divine revelations in the recovery.”
