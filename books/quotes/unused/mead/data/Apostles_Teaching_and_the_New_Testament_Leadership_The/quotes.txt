[1]  The Apostles Teaching and the New Testament Leadership CONTENTS
[2]  Spoken to His first group of disciples and to be taught to all His disciples Matt 28:19-20.
[3]  The teaching of the Spirit of truth John 16:12-15: The teaching according to godliness 1 Tim 6:3b.
[4]  God s speaking in the teaching of the New Testament was completed through Paul and John Col 1:25-26; Rev 22:18-19 .
[5]  Colossians 1:25-26 says, Of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God, the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now has been manifested to His saints.
[6]  Revelation 22:18-19 says, I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.
[7]  The crucial constituents of God s economy are Christ as the mystery of God, the church as the mystery of Christ, and Christ and the church as the great mystery in the universe.
[8]  The entire New Testament is a unique, divine revelation concerning mainly three persons or items: the Triune God, the all-inclusive Christ, and the church as the organism of the Triune God, the organic Body of Christ.
[9]  CHAPTER TWO THE NEW TESTAMENT LEADERSHIP Scripture Reading: Acts 2:36; 5:31; Rev 1:5; Eph 1:22; Col 1:18; 1 Cor 11:3; Heb 13:24; Rom 12:8; 1 Tim 5:17; 3:2; 1 Pet 5:2-3; 1 Thes 5:12; Heb 13:17; Gal 2:7; Rom 11:13; 1 Cor 16:12; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 2 John 9-11; 2 Cor 13:10; 1 Cor 4:17b-21; 7:17b; 16:1; 11:2; 2 Thes 3:6, 9, 12, 14; 1 Cor 1:10; 5:11-13; 11:34b; 2 Cor 10:6; Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5; 1 Tim 5:19-20; Exo 28:29-30; Num 27:15-23; 1 Sam 3:1, 19-21; Acts 15:6, 23, 28; 2:42; 13:1 The headship of Christ: Christ having been made Lord and Christ by God Acts 2:36.
[10]  Christ having been exalted as the Leader over all the rulers Acts 5:31.
[11]  The Bible does say that the church is the church of God 1 Cor 1:2; 10:32 , the church of Christ Rom 16:16 , and the church of the saints 1 Cor 14:33 .
[12]  Concerning the New Testament leadership, the Bible firstly speaks of the headship of Christ.
[13]  Christ Having Been Made Lord and Christ by God
[14]  Moreover, as God s sent and anointed One, He was Christ from the time He was born Luke 2:11; Matt 1:16; John 1:41; Matt 16:16 , but as such a One, He was officially made the very Christ of God in His ascension.
[15]  Christ is also the Head of every man under the headship of God 1 Cor 11:3 .
[16]  The leadership in the church life is carried out by the elders laboring in teaching the saints 1 Tim 5:17; 3:2 and their shepherding the church as the flock of God, overseeing it according to God, and becoming patterns of the flock, not lording it over the flock 1 Pet 5:2-3 .
[17]  Without delegated authorities, the whole earth would be in anarchy and disorder and would be unsuitable for living in. Today a wind of teaching is blowing in the Lord s recovery, saying that there is no delegated authority in the church.
[18]  If Brother Nee was wrong, the Bible is also wrong because the Bible strongly reveals God s delegated authority in the church life and in the ministry.
[19]  The theocratic government in the churches in the New Testament is through the Spirit who dwells in the spirits of the apostles and the elders, both of whom are the New Testament priests, with the revelation of the New Testament teaching Acts 15:6, 23, 28; 2:42; 1 Thes 5:12; 1 Tim 3:2; 5:17 .
