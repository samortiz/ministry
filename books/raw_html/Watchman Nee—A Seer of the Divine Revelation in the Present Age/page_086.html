<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. DENOMINATIONS</H2><P>Opposition from the denominations was a third source of Watchman Nee's suffering. He was an anti-testimony against them, and because of this it caused him much suffering.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Despised</H2><P>The denominations thoroughly despised Watchman Nee, and this caused him a great deal of suffering. He began writing the three volumes of The Spiritual Man at the age of twenty-three. One top theologian in China reacted by saying, "Watchman Nee is just a clever young man who has excelled in reading English books. He has gathered all these things from the books and translated them into Chinese." Sometimes being despised cuts more deeply than being criticized. At that time Hebrews 13:13 was very real and applicable to Watchman and to others as well: "Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach."

In his paper, The Christian, published from 1925 through 1927, he strongly exposed the deviation of the denominations from the pure truths of the Scriptures. They could do nothing but criticize him. They put out many writings criticizing his ministry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Opposition</H2><P>On the heels of the criticism came the opposition. Such a ministry to God's people as Watchman Nee's stirred up the opposition of the denominations, and they rose up to oppose him. They opposed him secretly and openly. Some preachers opposed him from their pulpit, publicly warning their congregations against him.</P><P>The following excerpts from his open letters in The Present Testimony unveil his attitude toward the opposition. In the twelfth issue, published December 1929, he wrote:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P>
