   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR MEETING TO ENJOY CHRIST WITH GOD 1 Scripture Reading: Deut 12:5-7, 11-12; 14:22-23; Lev 2:1-3; 3:9-11; 6:9, 12, 26; 7:5-6, 15, 19b, 29-34</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to this point, that is, when we meet, we meet to enjoy Christ with God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When most people go to a Christian gathering or a Christian meeting, they wouldn t say that they go to offer something to God, or even to enjoy something.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Usually they say that they go to listen to the preaching or to listen to the Word or to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, this is not wrong, but this is altogether from the human point of view concerning a religious meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Testament we have not been charged much to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course it does charge us, but not that much.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first time that the New Testament says something about Christians gathering is in Matthew 18:20: For where two or three are gathered together into Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My name, there I am in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The book of Acts didn t charge the newly saved ones to meet together, but they gathered spontaneously every day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Paul s writings he did instruct us a little bit in 1 Corinthians 14 how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians 14:26 may be considered the unique verse that tells us how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That verse says that when we come together as the church, each one should have something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This one has a psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Another one has a teaching, and another one has a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The last two are tongues and interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means you have to come together with something.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Using the Old Testament term, do not come empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You should come with something in your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You should be filled to come to the meeting to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But even in this verse Paul doesn t mention that you have to offer something and that you have to enjoy something and that you have to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE OLD TESTAMENT PICTURES</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once again you can see how that the New Testament with its clear teaching in plain words needs the Old Testament picture to illustrate it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A picture is always better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some things you just cannot describe by word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose you try to describe my face by writing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You would need so many terms to describe the shape of the nose or the two lips.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if you simply have a photo you can be so clear about my face.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Right away you can see two ears and one nose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You can see two eyes and one mouth, two cheeks, and a forehead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You don t need to exhaust the dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You can simply look at the photo.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason that God teaches us in the Bible in somewhat a kindergarten way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Firstly, there are the pictures in the Old Testament; then there is the word in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>REDEEMED TO MEET</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Old Testament you do have an excellent and wonderful type of how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I love it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1959 I had a thorough study of the Pentateuch with the saints in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In that year the Lord showed us many marvelous things concerning how His people should meet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was at that time we saw that God redeemed His people mainly for the purpose of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The children of Israel were down in Egypt, under the tyranny of Pharaoh and in the slavery of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But then they were redeemed and delivered out of that tyranny and slavery and brought into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Life-study of Exodus we pointed out that the word wilderness here is not a negative term.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a positive word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord said that He would bring His people into the wilderness to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In their meetings what did they do?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They feasted with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They feasted before God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God then spent a long time to train them how to meet in the way of feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God didn t teach them how to sing a solo or a quartet.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God didn t write a hymn book for them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God didn t even teach them to kneel down, to bow down, to prostrate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He didn t teach them how to be quiet, how to meditate, or even how to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That was not God s teaching concerning His people s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The singings, the solos, the quartets, the being quiet or the being noisy are all religious inventions.</S>
