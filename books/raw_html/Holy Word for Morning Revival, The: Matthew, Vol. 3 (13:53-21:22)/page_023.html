<p class="bold">WEEK 14 — DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 18:1-4, 6, 10</h2><p>1 &nbsp;In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest <sup>1</sup>in the kingdom of the heavens?</p> <p class="bold">2 &nbsp;And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst</p><p class="bold">3 &nbsp;And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</p> <p class="bold">4 &nbsp;He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p class="bold">6 &nbsp;And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe into Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea.</p><p class="bold">10 &nbsp;See that you do not despise one of these little ones…</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Chapters eighteen, nineteen, and twenty are a distinct section of the Gospel of Matthew dealing with the relationships among the kingdom people.…We need to have an overall view of these three chapters, which cover five matters. [These five matters are: pride, our inability to forgive others—the root of which lies in our dispositional anger, lust, riches, and ambition.] All these problems are within us. If we would get into the depths of these chapters, we would certainly be touched. For instance, we would see that we are people full of pride and that anger is hidden in our disposition. No matter how patient or forbearing we try to be, anger is still deeply rooted in our disposition. This is what makes it difficult for us to forgive others. Furthermore, we are troubled by lust and riches, both of which damage the kingdom life. Finally, there is the problem of ambition. Matthew purposely covers these five problems in his Gospel to show that we must take care of them in order to be in the kingdom. Pride, dispositional anger, lust, riches, and ambition are all “scorpions.” We need a divine pest control to kill these “scorpions.”</p><p>In the kingdom life, humility is required (18:1-4). In principle, all the kingdom people must be little children. To be humble is to be like a little child. If we are not humble, we will either be offended by others or we will offend others, that is, we will either be stumbled by others or stumble others. All stumbling takes place because of pride. If we were not proud, we would not be stumbled.…If a little child is offended, the offense will be forgotten in just a few minutes. But once adults are offended, they are stumbled because of their pride. Furthermore, the stumbling we cause to others also issues from our pride.</p><p>It is a serious matter to stumble someone [v. 6]. In these verses the Lord warns us to deal with this matter. If the hand, the foot, or the eye causes us to stumble [vv. 8-9], we must deal with these causes of stumbling in a serious way.…In order to be in the proper kingdom life, we need to be humble. Then we will not be stumbled or be a cause of stumbling to others. All stumbling must be abandoned.</p><p>No matter how small we are, we are lovely in the eyes of the Father, and He cares for us. He does not like to see anyone stumbled. We so easily offend the little ones for whom the Father cares, and as little ones ourselves we are easily stumbled. If we would avoid being stumbled and stumbling others, we need to be humbled. Humility will rescue us. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 603, 607-608)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>1<sup>1</sup> This chapter deals with the way we should live and act in the kingdom of the heavens: (1) we should become like little children (vv. 2-4); (2) we should not stumble others or set up any stumbling block (vv. 5-9); (3) we should not despise even a little believer (vv. 10-14); (4) we should hear the church and not be condemned by it (vv. 15-20); and (5) we should forgive a brother without limit (vv. 21-35). All this indicates that to enter into the kingdom of the heavens we must be humble and not despise any believer, but love our brother and forgive our brother.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 603-608; Hymns: #943</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
