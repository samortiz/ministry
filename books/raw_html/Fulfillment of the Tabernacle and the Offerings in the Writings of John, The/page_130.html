<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Newborn Child</h2><p>You may be surprised to learn what the eighth sign is in these chapters. The eighth sign is the sign of a newborn child. In 16:20 the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, “Truly, truly, I say to you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.” The Lord went on to liken the disciples’ sorrow to that of a woman giving birth to a child (v. 21). Then the Lord continued, “You therefore now indeed have sorrow; but I shall see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you” (v. 22). Here we see that the disciples are a “woman” travailing to give birth to a “child.” This child is the firstborn Son of God.<p>In resurrection Jesus Christ was born as the firstborn Son of God. Before incarnation He was God’s only begotten Son, and He continued to be the only begotten Son until His resurrection. But in resurrection He was born as the first begotten Son of God. This was the newborn child in John 16, and in this child we all are included. As we shall see, eventually this newborn child is a corporate man, a new man. What a great sign this is!<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Divine Glorification</h2><p>The ninth sign, seen in chapter seventeen, is the sign of the divine glorification. In 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, “Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.” Not many Christians have a full understanding of what this means. This is a matter of divine glorification, a matter that involves us. This is proved by the fact that the very glory the Lord Jesus shares with the Father has been given to us so that in this glory we may be one: “And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one” (17:22).<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Believers’ Oneness in the Triune God</h2><p>The last sign in John 14 through 17 is the sign of the believer’s oneness in the Triune God. According to John 17, the believers need to be preserved in oneness in the name of the Father, by the word of God, and by the glory of God. Eventually, we all shall be perfectly one in the Triune God. This oneness is the Father’s house. By this we see that these four chapters begin with the Father’s house and end with the oneness of the believers in the Triune God, and that such a oneness is actually the house of the Father. This is an overview of the signs in John 14 through 17.
