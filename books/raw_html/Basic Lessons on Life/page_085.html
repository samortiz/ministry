<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. OUR SPIRIT KNOWING THE THINGS OF A MAN</H2><P>To know the things of a man, we cannot depend upon our mind. To know a man, we need our spirit. First Corinthians 2:11a says that only the spirit of man can know the things of a man. If we do not know how to exercise our spirit, we cannot know people. To know people, we have to exercise our spirit. A person may come to us and speak something to us, but if we merely understand him with our mind according to his word, we will be cheated. We have to exercise our spirit to know his spirit and his intention behind his word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. PERCEIVING THINGS IN OUR SPIRIT</H2><P>We also need to perceive things in our spirit (Mark 2:8a, KJV). To observe things according to our sight and understanding is not the real perceiving. The proper perceiving is to see through things and to know things thoroughly by exercising our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. PURPOSING IN OUR SPIRIT</H2><P>Paul purposed in his spirit (Acts 19:21a). We may think that to purpose or make a decision is always by using our will. But we must purpose and make decisions in our spirit. Then we are spiritual men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. JUDGING A PERSON IN OUR SPIRIT</H2><P>First Corinthians 5 tells us that Paul judged a sinful one in the church at Corinth in his spirit (vv. 3-5a). We should not judge anyone superficially according to our feeling or understanding. We have to judge people in our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIV. BEING A PERSON IN OUR SPIRIT</H2><P>We need to be a person in our spirit. John said that he was in spirit on the Lord's Day (Rev. 1:10). To be a person in our spirit needs much exercise.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XV. EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT BY DOING<br>THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THINGS</H2><P>To exercise our spirit, we have to do all of the above-mentioned things.</P>
