   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEVER DESPISING ANYONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHO IS NOT POSITIVE FOR THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not make a division or draw a line between who is positive for the new way and who is not.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even in our talk we may say that a certain brother is not for the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is not good and we should never utter anything like this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not have the concept that only the saints who are positive for the new way are in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A brother in a local church who does not agree with the new way is still in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We who are positive for the new way should not despise or look down on anyone who is not positive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We hope that anyone who does not agree with the scriptural way will not oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Opposing can stir up dissension, and dissension will issue in division.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This will be a damage to the Lord s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even a little dissension may kill the blessing of the Lord in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ALWAYS SUBMITTING YOURSELF</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TO THE PRESENT PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OF THE LOCAL CHURCH IN YOUR LOCALITY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>WITH A POSITIVE, CONSTRUCTIVE, AND BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>SPIRIT AND ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even if the church in your locality does not practice the new way, you still have to submit yourself to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If your local church does not practice the new way and you grasp the chance in a meeting to promote it and preach or teach about it, this is not proper and indicates that you are not submitting yourself to the present practice of your local church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What you say depends on the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church in your locality may not practice the new way, yet the spirit, attitude, and atmosphere of the church allows you to fellowship about the new way or give a testimony of your practice of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is different from promoting, preaching, or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You have to see what the atmosphere in the meeting is and know the attitude and the spirit of the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may have the sense that it would be good to give a testimony of how you go to visit people, who has been saved, and how the home meetings have helped the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the atmosphere in the meeting and the spirit and attitude of the church is against this, do not give such a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the church in your locality does not like to practice according to the scriptural way, submit yourself to their present practice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if the church does not like anyone to say anything about the new way, do not say it in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This does not mean that you cannot talk in your home with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have the liberty to fellowship with some of the saints in their homes, but do this with a pure motive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not have the attitude that since the church is opposing the new way, you will do something secretly to tear down and overthrow the present practice and bring in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is altogether not good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord does not carry out things in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>NEVER DEBATING, ARGUING,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>OR FIGHTING WITH ANYONE CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE NEW WAY BUT CARRYING THE NEW WAY OUT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>IN A LIVING AND BUILDING UP WAY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>ACCORDING TO THE LORD S INSTANT LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AND ARRANGEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once you sense that an argument is rising up, you should stop what you are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If five saints are gathered together in a home and two or three of them are opposing, do not talk about the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Under the Lord s sovereign arrangement, these opposing ones may leave.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The others might be stirred up by the Lord to ask you some questions about your practice of preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then you can give them a report about what the Lord has been doing, and they will receive some help.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not need to fight or struggle for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We realize the Lord s new way is profitable, scriptural, and workable, so we practice it without promoting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet if there is the opportunity, we can fellowship with the saints and leave the result in the hands of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should never debate, argue, or fight with anyone concerning the new way, but we should carry the new way out in a living and building up way according to the Lord s instant leading and arrangement.</S>
