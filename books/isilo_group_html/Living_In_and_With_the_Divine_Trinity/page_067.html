Jude is not teaching us theology, but he is charging us to enjoy the Divine Trinity. To enjoy the Divine Trinity, we need to pray. To pray is to get into the current of the Divine Trinity, to get into the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Through this fellowship, we reach the source of the love of God. Then in the love of God, we await and look for the mercy of our Lord, that we may not only enjoy eternal life in this age, but also inherit it for eternity (Matt. 19:29). In the opening of his Epistle, Jude mentioned mercy (v. 2). Mercy is mentioned instead of grace due to the church's degradation and apostasy. We all need the Lord's mercy. This mercy is a bridge to the grace of Christ. We need to pray in the Holy Spirit that we may touch the source, the love of God, in which we await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the enjoyment of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Be Consummated with Grace and Peace<br>by the Father, Who Is, Who Was, and Who Is Coming,<br>by the Seven Spirits, and<br>by Jesus Christ, the Faithful Witness,<br>the Firstborn of the Dead, and<br>the Ruler of the Kings of the Earth</H2><P>Our enjoyment of the Divine Trinity in full is consummated with grace and peace by the Father, who is, who was, and who is coming, by the seven Spirits, and by Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:4-5). Grace is the Triune God as our enjoyment, and peace is the issue, the result, of our enjoyment of grace. The more we enjoy the Triune God as our grace, the more we have peace within. In Revelation 1 the Father is referred to as the One who is, who was, and who is coming. As God the eternal Father, He was in the past, He is in the present, and He is coming in the future. This shows that even the Father Himself is triune. He is triune as the One who is, who was, and who is coming. The seven Spirits are the sevenfold intensified Spirit. The one Spirit has been intensified sevenfold. The sevenfold Spirit may be likened to a seven-way lamp. Such a seven-way lamp gives us the strongest light, the intensification of light. The Spirit today is intensified sevenfold because of the dark age.</P><P>According to Revelation 5:6, the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of Christ, the Lamb of God. Some theologians teach that the Son is separate from the Spirit, but in Revelation we see that the Spirit, the Third of the Trinity, is the eyes of the Son, the Second of the Trinity. A person's eyes are not separate from him. It is wrong to say that the Second, the Son, is separate from the Third, the Spirit. The Bible shows us that the Third is the eyes of the Second. Our eyes cannot be another person that is separate from us. This shows us the outwardness of the traditional teaching concerning the Trinity. Some have accused us of mixing up the three persons of the Godhead. Actually, it is the Bible that tells us that Christ is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 15:45b). Furthermore, according to Revelation, the Spirit is the eyes of Jesus, the Son. The Divine Trinity is a wonderful mystery. Martin Luther said that anyone who could explain the Divine Trinity must be the teacher of God. The Son and the Spirit are two, yet They are one. How do we know that They are one? The strongest proof is that the Third is the eyes of the Second.</P><P>We may not be able to understand the Divine Trinity, but we can enjoy Him. Every day we eat and enjoy food that we do not know how to define. We do not understand the food, but we can enjoy the food. I do not know what is in an orange, but I can enjoy the orange by eating it. We may not understand what is in a glass of orange juice, but we can enjoy it as our refreshment. A person may take many vitamins without being clear what the vitamins do and what they are for. However, because he takes these vitamins into him, he receives the benefit of each vitamin. This is why I say that we need to learn to enjoy the Father, enjoy the Son, and enjoy the Spirit. When we pray, call on the name of the Lord, and get into the Word, we enjoy the Triune God as our divine vitamins. The Father may be likened to vitamin A, the Son to vitamin B, and the Spirit to vitamin C. We may not understand what these "vitamins" do for us, but we must learn to enjoy them. We may not fully understand the Triune God, but we must learn to enjoy Him, to receive the full benefit of all His riches. Matthew 28:19, 2 Corinthians 13:14, Jude 20-21, and Revelation 1:4-5 reveal to us the enjoyment of the Triune God. We need to be those who enjoy the Divine Trinity in full.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Living In and With the Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
