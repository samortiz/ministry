   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING THE LORD S MANIFESTATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY LOVING THE LORD AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>KEEPING HIS COMMANDMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can we have the Lord s manifestation?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord says, He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him John 14:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A person who has the Lord s manifestation loves the Lord and keeps His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a person is loved by the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only so, the Son also manifests Himself to him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether you have the Lord s manifestation depends on whether you love the Lord and keep His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a practical and serious test.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have received the Lord s salvation, and the Lord is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are people in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, it may be difficult for us to take a further step and have the Lord s manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problem is whether we love the Lord and keep His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some people are saved but do not love the Lord or keep His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others are saved and love the Lord, but they have only a partial love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A person who has a partial love for the Lord keeps the Lord s commandment when it suits him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord s commandment is disagreeable to him, he will not keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At such a time, he does not let the Lord win; rather, he defeats the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Any dispute between us and the Lord in which we defeat the Lord instead of letting Him defeat us, proves that we do not love Him enough.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some may ask when and in what matters they have defeated the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord has been defeated by us in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Going to the movies is an example.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may have a strong desire to go see a movie, but the Lord gives an inward command, saying, No. This is the Lord s speaking to us in love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even though we know that we should obey Him, we disobey and go to the movie.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the way that we defeat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord speaks to us because we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we did not love Him, He would not bother to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our love for a person is an encouragement for him to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If someone does not want a person to speak to him, he should not love him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he ignores a person and does not bother with him, the person will not come to him, much less speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Conversely, whomever he loves will come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This also applies to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those whom we do not love or whom we dislike will not bother to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the more we love someone, the more he will come to be near us and speak with us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Similarly, as a result of even a little love toward the Lord Jesus, He will come to bother you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will say, Did you not say that you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Did you not say that you would consecrate yourself to Me?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because you have consecrated yourself to the Lord, you love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, now when you want to go to a movie, the Lord will say, Do not go.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the Lord s commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He who has the Lord s commandments and keeps them loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, after you receive the Lord s commandment, you may argue with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord says, Do not go, but you say, I want to go.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord says, Do not go, but you say, I will go only this once.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord says, You must not go, but you insist, I will go this time but not again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord says, No, not even this time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the argument that you have with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I believe that you all have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It may not have been concerning movies, but we have many such arguments with the Lord, and it seems that we always defeat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all have had the experience of defeating the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord Jesus is so great and we are so small, yet we often defeat Him and overthrow His throne in us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord is daily being defeated by many people whom He has saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should consider how many times we have defeated the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many times, when the Lord asks us to do something, we argue with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This argument is a battle between the Lord and us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord gives us a commandment, but we receive it grudgingly, or we say that we would rather do something else.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the Lord says no, we argue with Him, and we defeat Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although it seems as if we have only defeated the Lord, we actually have disobeyed His commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many of us have had this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every time we defeat the Lord and disobey His commandment, we lose His presence within us, and we no longer have His face, because He hides Himself from us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, there are also times when He gives a commandment, and we say, O Lord, because I love You, I will let myself be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I will receive Your commandment, listen to Your commandment, and obey Your commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I will go along with what You say.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whenever we respond in this way, we experience sweetness, joy, and light.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We sense that the Lord is with us, and we see His face, His manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There was a young child who was saved and properly shepherded.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He often prayed, O Lord, I belong to You, and I am in You.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I give myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Lord, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I am willing to live to You.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is a good prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One morning, his mother gave him ten dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He was very happy and said, Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You love me so much that You have caused my mother to love me and give me ten dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Lord, I thank You and praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Immediately after he gave thanks, the Lord Jesus said to him, I want you to give the ten dollars to the child from a poor family who sat next to you in children s meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This made the child sad, and he could not pray anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The ten dollars became a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Lord wanted him to give the ten dollars away, but he treasured the money and wanted to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After that the child lost the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This does not mean that the Lord was not with him; it means that he could not sense the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord s presence was hidden from him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He could not see the Lord s face, so he no longer had any joy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When his mother noticed that something was wrong, she asked why he was unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, the child was not willing to talk about it; he said that everything was okay.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It seemed as if the problem was the ten dollars, but the real problem was his love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord might have asked, Do you love Me more than the ten dollars?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This would have bothered the child.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord said, He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me...If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word John 14:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Christians may appear to have no problem, but there is a problem concerning their love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This child had a problem because he regarded the ten dollars more than the Lord s word, the Lord s commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It seemed as if he would rather have the ten dollars than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Because the child did not want to let go of the Lord, he wished that the Lord had not given him this commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He hoped in his heart that the Lord would change this commandment, but the Lord insisted on his giving the ten dollars away.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Therefore, the child struggled for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>While he did not obey the Lord, he had no light, and he did not have the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Therefore, he was unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is the story of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We have had this kind of experience often.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Even a person who has followed the Lord for many years often argues with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In the midst of his argument, he often realizes that the Lord has withdrawn and is hiding His face.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>His argument with the Lord is the result of his partial love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Genuine love is unconditional.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If our love for the Lord is genuine, we will keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Whatever He says, we will do.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Whatever He wants, we will give.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Whatever He requires of us, we will accept.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we genuinely love the Lord, we will keep His commandments, and we will have His manifestation.</S>
