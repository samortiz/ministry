   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Merely Keeping the Lord's Gift,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Neither Losing It nor Gaining a Profit by Using It</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Merely to keep the Lord's gift and not lose it is not sufficient; we must gain a profit by using it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this lesson we do not need to get into the full interpretation of this parable, because we can ask the saints to read some of the Life-study Messages in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But we must stress to them that actually to hide our gift in the earth is not to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The earth refers to the worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As long as we do not use our gift, we are hiding it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to point out these three dangers: mistreating fellow believers, keeping company with worldly people, and not using our gift to do the Lord's service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to point out that many are hiding their gift, not using their gift, because they do not serve.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE LOSS: A. To Be Cut Off from the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>at His Coming Back</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>to Be Separated from the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>in His Coming Glory</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord comes back, He will come in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, He will be clothed in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The unfaithful ones who did not use their gifts will be cut off from His glory at His coming back Matt 24:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They will have no share in His coming glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For a full interpretation of this, we need to read the appropriate Life-study Messages on Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To Be Chastened Dispensationally</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be cut off from the coming glory of the Lord is a dispensational chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The ones who are chastised will be in weeping and gnashing of teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Weeping indicates regret, and gnashing of teeth indicates self-blame.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not know what this chastisement will be like, but we know that it will be a suffering.</S>
