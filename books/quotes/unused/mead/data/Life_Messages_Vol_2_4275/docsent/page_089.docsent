   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Culture</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every nation has its culture.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Colossians deals with the problems that arose in the church at Colosse over the matter of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believers there in Asia Minor were part Jews and part Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead of living by Christ, they were living according to their religious ordinances or their Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul admonished them, "As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him" Col 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not follow the elements of the world and the tradition of men v. 8 . Do not have regard for philosophy; that is simply part of the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Philosophy does not deserve your admiration; it is small and rudimentary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These intrusions of philosophy and tradition into the church at Colosse even in the early days caused damage to the church because such aspects of culture were replacing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have a wide assortment of people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are Chinese, Japanese, Indonesians, Filipinos, and Malaysians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We also have some here from Singapore and Thailand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I would ask you, do you live by Christ or by the culture in which you have been raised?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many of you are overseas Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you live by the Chinese culture, or by the culture of the country where you are?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may be a Chinese living by the Filipino culture, or by the Indonesian, Malaysian, or Thai cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Your overseas Chinese culture has been influenced by the native cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What you live by is this mixed culture, not by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yes, occasionally Christ within directs you, but most hours of the day you are governed by something else.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are saved and have Christ within, but in actuality you are a Filipino Chinese, or a Japanese, or an Indonesian.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You live according to science, philosophy, local church custom, and the ethics of your culture.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may protest that you love the Lord and are living the church life; why do I use the term local church custom?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you consider quietly, however, you will realize that you are not living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are living something else, whether you call it the church life or local church custom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unconsciously, you are living your culture.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The culture you live, moreover, is partly of your own creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have developed your own outlook on life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have your own religion and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these are distinct from everyone else's. When you come to a crisis, you depend on this "superior" culture to carry you through.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You Japanese brothers, for example, are all saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have the same Christ and the same Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You sing the same hymns and shout the same slogans.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet not more than one hour of the day do you live Christ, forgetting yourself, forgetting Japanese culture, and forgetting each other.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This may happen when you are praying or exercising your spirit in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The rest of the time you are living your self-imposed standards.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The same is true of those from the island of Mindanao or from Indonesia.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their life is ordered and controlled by the principles they have set up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are critical of others who do not live up to their standard.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are pleased with how well they themselves abide by those standards.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The young sisters may have a high goal before them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They act properly and are grateful to the Lord for saving them and placing them in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But they feel they must do this and take care of that.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means they are setting up their own culture, instead of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some people are bothered by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To us sin may not be an issue.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the knowledge of science and philosophy, the practice of religion, and the influence of culture are still with us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is by these that we live.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE MEANING OF WALKING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are not to live in the self, or in religion, or in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are in Christ, and we are to walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must not let the traditions of men take us away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let religion go.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Let the law go.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let culture go.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Stay in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is above culture, philosophy, and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Live Him!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Who is this One?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not think of Him as far off on the throne above.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As the Spirit He mingles with your spirit, making you one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Stay in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Let the Spirit be in control.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When you are in spirit, you live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Let Him be in charge, rather than your culture.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You have heard messages like this before, but have quickly forgotten.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Before you know it, you will once again be back in your culture, living according to local church custom.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You will be considering how to get along with others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You will try to think up pleasant words to say to smooth over a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Remember that whenever you are not in your spirit, you are not living Christ but something else.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ is the Spirit, giving life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Outside of Him there are countless things we take as substitutes.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All such substitutes are other than He.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even the study of the Bible is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only the Spirit is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must be in that Spirit, mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>To live Christ is to live in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Care only for this one matter: be in spirit, live in spirit, walk in spirit, pray in spirit, and fellowship in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Let other things go.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Simply live Christ.</S>
