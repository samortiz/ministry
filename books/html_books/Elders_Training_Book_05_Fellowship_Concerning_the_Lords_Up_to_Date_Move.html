<h1 class="title">THE NEED TO SEE THE VISION<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord Jesus, how we treasure this time! We believe it is altogether of You that we are all gathered together into Yourself. Lord, grant Your blessing upon all of us and do bless this time. Sanctify us, Lord. Lord, grant us the anointing. Lord, grant us a gracious, rich, and abundant visit. Lord, open up the heavens. Even Lord, open up Your heart to us and help us to open ourselves to you. Amen, Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEAVENLY VISION</h2>
<p>In Acts 26:19 Paul said, &ldquo;Wherefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.&rdquo; After Paul was caught by the Lord, he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. Paul speaks not only of a vision, but of a vision from the heavens, a heavenly vision. In his defense of himself and his ministry before King Agrippa, he indicated that he had earlier received a vision from the earth, an earthly vision. This was the vision of the law. Paul had been fully caught by that vision, but while he was so vigorously carrying out that vision, he was caught by One from the heavens who gave him another vision. This other vision is mainly described in verse 18: &ldquo;To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.&rdquo; Forgiveness of sins is the initial grace and the base of all the blessings of the New Testament jubilee, while the inheritance is the main object of this heavenly vision. For us to see what this inheritance is requires much unveiling. Actually, Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles are the development and the description of this inheritance. If you would read and study his fourteen Epistles thoroughly, you could see that this inheritance is nothing less than the processed Triune God who is consummated in the all-inclusive, compound Spirit. This inheritance is the very Triune God in His divinity dispensed into us for our enjoyment. The forgiveness of sins is an initiation into the enjoyment of such an inheritance. This heavenly vision is not like the earthly vision concerning the law. The law does not give life (Gal. 3:21) or bring any kind of enjoyment. There is no inheritance with the law. The law is full of requirements, and the law only demands.</p>
<p>The initial stage of the vision from the heavens is the forgiveness of sins. Do not despise this initial aspect. The forgiveness of sins deals with so many things, including sin, oldness, worldliness, and everything that is a frustration to God&rsquo;s eternal move. When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, vigorously carrying out the old vision, he became a great obstacle to frustrate God&rsquo;s eternal economy, yet he had no realization of this. To sin is not just to steal, to commit fornication, or to murder. Apparently, Saul was a very ethical and moral person, never stealing, never committing fornication, and never murdering. According to the law he was righteous, but in the eyes of God he was the second greatest enemy to God&rsquo;s economy. The greatest enemy was Satan, and the second greatest enemy was Saul of Tarsus. The embodiment of God, the very Christ, came to this enemy telling him, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? You are attacking Me. You are My enemy. No one among human kind has ever frustrated Me as much as you have. Do you think all the Gentiles are so sinful and that you are so righteous? Actually, you are more sinful than all the Gentiles. But here is a vision for you to bring mainly to My chosen people among the Gentiles, those whom you condemn to the uttermost. The first item of this vision is the forgiveness of sins, and the positive aspect of this vision is that you are to bring the Gentiles condemned by you into the very enjoyment of Me, the embodiment of the processed Triune God. Of course, you also are My chosen one. I forgive you and now I bring you into this enjoyment. Whatever you have seen of Me and whatever you have enjoyed of Me will be the very vision that you will carry to the Gentiles condemned by you. I will make them your fellow-believers, and I will make them and you with all your fellow countrymen chosen by Me one Body, not only to enjoy Me, but also to contain Me to let Me have a full expression in this universe, the testimony of Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acts 26:18 says that the inheritance is among &ldquo;those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.&rdquo; The phrase, &ldquo;by faith in Me&rdquo; means for the believers to enter into an organic union with the embodied God in Christ and processed and consummated in the Spirit. We all have to enter into this organic union with such a processed and consummated God. How could the chosen ones enter into such a union? By faith, not by sight or appearance. This vision is comprised solely of invisible things which are only realized and substantiated by faith.</p>
<p>We should not regard Acts 26:18 in a common way. However, for years we may not have spent time to get into the significance of such a verse. We may have just read it and taken it for granted. We may not have considered what the forgiveness of sins is or what it comprises. Previously we may have understood the inheritance to be a heavenly mansion which we would inherit in the future. What is it to be sanctified? What is it to have faith in Him? We took these matters for granted as if we understood everything. This is the vision that Paul received from the heavens, which he carried out for so many years. When he was arrested by the Jews and defended himself before King Agrippa, he declared that from the time he had received the vision until then, he was never disobedient to this heavenly vision. This vision was the very ground, the very vigor, and the very content of this apostle&rsquo;s ministry. He ministered based upon this vision, he ministered with vigor by this vision, and he ministered by taking this vision as his goal. This vision enabled him to withstand any kind of persecution and opposition, and this vision enabled him never to have any change or deviation. He was bold to tell Agrippa that he had never disobeyed this vision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESTRAINING VISION</h2>
<p>Proverbs 29:18 says, &ldquo;Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint&rdquo; (ASV). The King James Version says &ldquo;the people perish,&rdquo; the New American Standard Version says &ldquo;the people are unrestrained,&rdquo; and the Berkeley Version says &ldquo;the people run wild.&rdquo; All these different renderings refer to people who are not governed, directed, ruled, or restrained. To cast away any kind of restraint means you are unwilling to be restrained, to be ruled. The King James translation of this verse, which says &ldquo;the people perish,&rdquo; actually refers to the result or issue of casting off restraint and being unruly. The result is that you perish. Surely, if we take the way of having no vision, we will perish. This corresponds with the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 7:14: &ldquo;For the gate is narrow and the way is constricted which leads to life.&rdquo; Constricted means ruling or governing. A person can drive many places in the United States, but his driving must be restrained by the white lines on the road. If you do not drive in a governed way, either you will perish or others will perish. The history of Christianity is a history of people driving with no restraint, with no vision. The second half of Proverbs 29:18 says, &ldquo;But he that keepeth the law, happy is he.&rdquo; The law is the restraint, the ruling. You may have the law yet not see the law to have a vision. The Jews of the Old Testament had the law, but not everyone saw the vision. One who has the law but does not see the law to have a vision will run wild. Where there is no vision, the people run wild.</p>
<p>At this time, we must review our vision at least once more. No doubt, we have to thank the Lord for His mercy that we all are here. We have received much mercy and we have experienced much grace. Still we need to strengthen and stress our vision at least once more. What can we say concerning the Lord&rsquo;s vision in His recovery? What would we tell people that we have seen in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? If we do not have a vision, we become so common. We become those doing just another piece of Christian work. Since the reformation, such common works have been raised up again and again in many places. Today many different Christian works are all around us. Are we going to add to this number of common and even good Christian works? Shall we preach the gospel in the common way, go to the mission fields to be a missionary, open up a school to teach the Bible, put out some papers to expound the holy Word, or set up some meetings to gather the seeking ones to worship, serve, and edify each other? All these are quite common. If we intend to do this then we had better close our halls. To be here in this way without a controlling vision would be meaningless.</p>
<p>Although I can never compare myself with the Apostle Paul, I cannot deny that I have seen a vision. I would die for this vision. So many dear ones all advise me to rest, but I do not care for my life. I prefer to live and to die for my commission that I may finish my course. I would endeavor to exhaust my entire being until I die. The Scriptures say in Psalm 90 that human life, generally speaking, is up to seventy years of age, and that if you are strong you may live to be eighty (v. 10). At the age of eighty-one, I am beyond the age that the Scriptures define for a man&rsquo;s lifetime. My wife frequently reminds me that I am over eighty and that I need to take care of myself. Many times, I rested in order to take care of her. The reason that I labor both day and night is because of the heavy burden of the vision. I am a small man and I have no degree, no fame, no position, and no rank. Yet even the angels can testify for me that I have really seen something. I have seen something not only for the recovery, but for the entire aggregate of all Christians. I am so sorrowful for the present ignorance among the Catholics, among the Protestants, and among you all. This is my burden, dear saints. Because I have seen the vision, I just cannot spare myself.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SHORTAGE OF THE VISION</h2>
<p>I have been with many of you brothers in the English-speaking world for over twenty-two years. Truthfully speaking, many of you are still under a kind of ignorance. What you do, what you say, and how you take care of the churches, indicates that you are short of the vision that I have seen and that the Lord has been speaking to us for the past twenty-two years. I am especially regretful that it is as if some of you have never heard the messages given in the elders&rsquo; training of 1984. What a revelation was in those messages! Since those messages were delivered, though, has there ever been a change in you? Has there been a change in your being, in your service, and in your taking care of the church? According to my observation, there has not been much change. That training of twelve days with three messages each day may have become a vanity to some of you. In those messages the New Testament ministry, the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the way to carry out the vision, and other crucial matters concerning the practice of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery were stressed very much. One strong point in these messages is that the elders should not control the church. Even after that fellowship, in some churches, stronger control was exercised. This is a shame. The more the Lord in His ministry tells us not to control the church, the more control is exercised by some. This is a cause for much suffering, and this is a proof that those messages were not effective for some.</p>
<p>To control the saints is a shame. If you control a church you will suffer spiritual death. History testifies to this. You cannot control God&rsquo;s people. The Holy Spirit would not allow you to do such a thing. Even the spirits within the saints would not allow this. The leading ones are slaves. In the Life-study of Matthew I told the sisters who are the wives of the elders to consider themselves as the wives of slaves. Although I gave such a strong word in 1976, many went back afterwards to be nearly the kings in their locality. Paul, in his ministry, considered himself as a slave. In 2 Corinthians 4:5 he said, &ldquo;For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not control the churches. I simply speak the word of God. I do not have the intention to control anyone, but I do have a burden to release the holy Word. Because of this, so many of the saints listen to me. You may try to get people to listen to you, but the more you do this the more they will go away from you. Whether or not the saints would listen to you depends upon how much you could minister to them. You are here because you received the help from the ministry of the holy Word, but regrettably you only received the help according to your taste. You did not take the ministry that comes from the Lord absolutely. As a result, you have suffered. You should pray, &ldquo;Lord, help me to take my hands off. I would go back only to serve your flock as a slave. I would not control anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The holy Word is more than clear on this matter. In Matthew 23:8-11, the Lord told the disciples, &ldquo;But you, do not be called Rabbi; for one is your Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone your father on the earth; for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens. Neither be called leaders, because One is your Leader, the Christ. And the greater among you shall be your servant.&rdquo; Because of these verses, some brothers in England in the last century picked up the term brethren. First Peter 5:3 says to the elders, &ldquo;Nor as lording it over the allotments, but becoming patterns of the flock.&rdquo; The elders must set themselves up as an example. Labor to be an example. If there is the need of cleaning, you have to do the cleaning first. If there is the need of vacuuming, you have to do the vacuuming first. If there is the need of cleaning the restroom, you have to do it as a pattern. You should not sit on a throne giving orders, ruling others. This is absolutely wrong. There is not such a thing as a &ldquo;local headship.&rdquo; The only headship in the church is the heavenly headship.</p>
<p>When some referred to me as an elder or an apostle, this was an insult to me. I am just a small man, without fame, without degree, trying the best to be a slave to serve not only the saints but also the sinners by ministering the Word which the Lord has opened up to me. Many of the brothers can testify for me that I never exercised any kind of authority to control anyone. Do not think that I am deaf or I am blind to the problems in the churches. I have a lot of feeling concerning all the churches, but I would never control the churches or say anything to control them. Whenever I hear something concerning some problems in the churches my practice is to pray for them.</p>
<p>I exhort all of you brothers not to control the church you are caring for. If possible, some of you should resign from the eldership. In the Bible there is a way for the appointing ones to deal with the wrong elders (1 Tim. 5:19-20). This is very rarely done because we do not believe in controlling, and we do not believe in adjusting. I only believe in the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace and in His holy Word moving in you by His gracious Spirit. This is all that I trust in. I trust in His mercy, His grace, the Word, and the Spirit. I do not like to control anything, to adjust anything, or to direct anything, but I like to pray for you to receive mercy, grace, the Word, and the Spirit. I do have a full trust in these four things, but it depends upon your attitude. Will you receive the mercy? Will you receive the grace? Will you receive the Word in an absolute way and not according to your choice, to your taste, to your preference, or to your priority? Just receive His mercy, His grace, and His Word absolutely and His Spirit unconditionally.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE MINISTRY&mdash;<br />
GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY IN FAITH</h2>
<p>In the elders&rsquo; training of 1984 we spoke strongly concerning the unique ministry of the New Testament. However, in the time since then some have endeavored to teach something different, to carry out something that differs from the unique ministry. In 1 Timothy 1 Paul says, &ldquo;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently.&rdquo; To teach differently mainly does not refer to heresy. Rather it refers to the Old Testament things, such as the law and the genealogies (1 Tim. 1:4, 7). These are the things which are different from the testimony of Jesus and from God&rsquo;s economy. This economy of God is not by any feeling or by an outward seeing. It is by faith.</p>
<p>Faith is a term that concerns the entire New Testament. Galatians 3:23-25 says that before faith came we were under law. Now that faith is come, we are no longer under the law. We have received the Holy Spirit not by an outward work, but by the hearing of faith (Gal. 3:2). Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith (Eph. 3:17) not through our feelings. Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4:13 that he spoke by the spirit of faith. In the following chapter he said that we walk not by appearance, not by anything seen or felt, but by faith (2 Cor. 5:7). Regeneration is not something you can see. Sanctification is not something that you can see. Transformation is not something you can see. Can you see the conformity to Christ&rsquo;s death? Probably the only thing that people will see will be our glorification. We all will be in glory; then all will see. But before that consummating item of God&rsquo;s salvation, nothing is visible. Nothing is by sight. Everything is by faith. Often when we quote Ephesians 3:17 and 1 Timothy 1:4, we do not include the words through faith or in faith.</p>
<p>In Hebrews 6:4-5 Paul said that we have become &ldquo;partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age.&rdquo; God has given us a foretaste of the things of the coming age, and many of the things of the coming age will be by sight, not by faith. When the millennium comes, there will be a great restoration (Isa. 11:6-9, 35:5-10; 65:25). But today all the bequests of the New Testament blessings are by faith, not by sight. In last year&rsquo;s elders&rsquo; training, this was stressed very much. But it seems that in the months since that time this word has become a vanity to some of you.</p>
<p>At that time the entire vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was presented to you concerning God, concerning Christ, concerning the Spirit, concerning the believers, concerning the church, concerning the kingdom, and concerning the New Jerusalem. According to my observation nearly all of the elders labor quite much, but in your labor you do not care much for the vision.</p><h2 class="head1">THE VISION FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S<br />
UP-TO-DATE RECOVERY</h2>
<p>What is the vision that the Lord has shown us for His up-to-date recovery? We all know that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery did not begin with us. The Lord began His recovery at least by the time of the reformers, among whom was Martin Luther. The main item that was recovered at that time was justification by faith. After that, the matter of the inner life was recovered through people like Madam Guyon, Father Fenelon, and Brother Lawrence, the so-called mystics. This was a reaction to the dead Protestantism in the 1600&rsquo;s. At about the same time sanctification by faith, the so-called holiness, was discovered. The brotherhood of the believers was discovered firstly by the Northern European brothers in the 1600&rsquo;s and later in the early 1800&rsquo;s by the Plymouth Brethren. Around Germany there were different kinds of &ldquo;brother&rdquo; churches, such as the Grace Brothers and even the Mennonites. Small items were also discovered such as baptism by immersion instead of sprinkling; because of this the Baptists were raised up. Administration which is not by bishops but by the presbytery, the elders, was also recovered; with this the Presbyterian denomination was raised up. Then the so-called gifts were discovered, giving rise to the Pentecostal movement. All these may be called sundry items. Immersion is a small item, the presbytery is a small item, and even the gifts are a very small item in relation to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 12 when Paul lists the gifts, he puts tongues and interpretation of tongues at &ldquo;the tail&rdquo; (12:8-10, 28). Although Paul lists tongues and interpretation of tongues as the last item among the gifts, some would uplift them not only as the head, but as the crown upon the head. This is altogether too much. Do you believe that the recovery of tongue-speaking is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? It is just one unimportant item of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Paul says that tongue-speaking builds up the individual, but does not build the church (1 Cor. 14:4). The problem with the discovery of the miraculous things is that some made these things the unique things. Even justification by faith is not the unique thing. Sanctification is not the unique thing. The inner life is not the unique thing. Needless to say, immersion or the presbytery are not the unique thing. Later, we will see what the unique thing is.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s New Testament move has been on this earth for nearly two thousand years. In this time the Lord has done very much. He has brought the gospel to every corner of this earth. His Word, the Holy Bible, has been translated into almost every language and dialect of man. Many have been brought to the Lord. Now we must consider several issues. First, in such a great work as this, how much has been carried out by the fundamentalists with the Word, and how much has been carried out by the Pentecostals with the Spirit? Perhaps more than ninety percent of the Lord&rsquo;s move in these two thousand years has been carried out by the fundamentalists with the Word. Less than ten percent has been carried out by the Pentecostals with the so-called &ldquo;Spirit.&rdquo; Second, if there were no Bible or expounding or teaching of the Bible on this earth, but only the Spirit with all the gifts, what would be the situation today? It would certainly be poor. Third, we must consider the way of the major denominations today. Beside the Catholic church there are the Episcopalian, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Baptist denominations. Of these, the Southern Baptists have the greatest membership. They do not speak much concerning the Spirit. Rather, they depend upon their Sunday school lessons. Qualified writers work the year around to compose the Sunday school lessons to be used in the next year. Basically, the Southern Baptists do not trust in their big meetings, but in their Sunday school lessons.</p>
<p>The fundamentalists&rsquo; way is with the Word. Since the middle part of the last century, the Pentecostal movement has risen up. Within this one and one-half centuries what has been built up by the so-called &ldquo;Spirit&rdquo; with the gifts? Only the Assembly of God has been built up. In half a century the membership of the Assembly of God has risen very quickly. But in their classes they taught their students not to try to build up the church by tongue-speaking. Instead they were told to build by teaching the Bible. All the other branches of the Pentecostal movement have been coming and going, even disappearing, but the Assembly of God stands because in their meetings they teach the Bible. In China, in 1936, I attended one of their meetings. A learned American missionary was there taking the lead by teaching people. They do not oppose tongue-speaking. Rather, they practice it privately, but they do not trust in this for the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE THING</h2>
<p>Throughout the past twenty centuries the work of the Spirit has been talked about and experienced by different Christians. In my study of spiritual books I have encountered the term &ldquo;the second blessing.&rdquo; The inner life people always encourage others to have a second blessing. That means that after you have been regenerated, you need another blessing. The fundamentalists use another term&mdash;the fullness of the Spirit. After you have been saved, you must seek after the fullness of the Spirit. Then the Pentecostal saints use another phrase&mdash;the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The Friends denomination, the Quakers, emphasize the experience of &ldquo;quaking.&rdquo; In Taiwan one denomination picked up the way of shaking their chairs to receive the power of the Spirit. The second blessing, the fullness of the Spirit, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, quaking, and chair shaking, all refer to the same thing in a broader sense. We should not be narrow. We should have a broader view. Do not stress so much that the second blessing is the unique thing. Actually this thing is about the same as the fullness of the Spirit. The fullness of the Spirit is about the same thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is about the same thing as quaking. If the inner life people stress the inner life as the unique thing as opposed to all other kinds of terminology, that is wrong. Every person firstly must be regenerated and then must be filled with the Spirit. No one can deny this fact. But how to express this and how to experience it may vary. It may differ according to your background and your environment.</p>
<p>In my home town of Chefoo, not too far from our hall was another hall where a group of Pentecostals met. Once their leader came to me trying to convince me to take up the Pentecostal way. I said to him. &ldquo;Brother, I surely know what your intention is in coming here. Since you have been in your way for years, how many do you have meeting with you?&rdquo; When he told me that they were under one hundred, I replied, &ldquo;I am not in your way, but among us are close to one thousand. Do you have the power or do I have the power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many Christians are narrow minded and short sighted. Once they get something, they would stay with that one thing and make it the unique thing. This is wrong. We have to believe in history. Christianity has been on this earth for nearly two thousand years. Millions have been saved and thousands became giants serving the Lord, including John Wycliffe, the reformers among whom was Martin Luther, Madam Guyon, Father Fenelon, Brother Lawrence, Zinzendorf, John and Charles Wesley, George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, and the Brethren teachers, among whom were J. N. Darby, William Kelley, and C. H. Mackintosh. The Brethren were especially powerful. They nearly saturated the entire earth with the truths they had seen from the Word. Then there were Charles Spurgeon, G. Campbell Morgan, S. D. Gordon, A. J. Gordon, Andrew Murray, Charles Finney, D. L. Moody, A. B. Simpson, Watchman Nee, and today there is Billy Graham. All of these brothers did not take the way of the so-called Pentecostal movement. Can we exclude them? Of course not. We must broaden our view to see the whole matter.</p>
<p>Now I would ask you, are we Lutheran? Are we mystics? Are we Brethren? Are we Presbyterian? Are we Methodists? No, we are not. Then what are we? Praise the Lord we are so small, but we are all-inclusive. We do not stress anything as &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; Only one thing is &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; In the next chapter we will see what the one thing is.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ONE THING, THE UNIQUE THING,<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h1>
<p>The one thing that should be focused on, stressed, and ministered in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the New Testament economy of God. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; The content of the New Testament economy of God is a Person. In the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/GNTE-chart.pdf">chart on pages 22 and 23</a> there are three sections concerning this wonderful Person. First, this Person is the Son with the Father by the Spirit in the first four books of the New Testament, the Gospels. In the second section of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is the Spirit, as the Son, with the Father. This section covers the twenty-two books from Acts through Jude. The last section of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is covered by the final book of the New Testament, Revelation. In Revelation are the seven Spirits, out from the eternal One of the Redeemer.</p>
<p>Over the last sixty years the Lord, by His mercy, has opened up His holy Word to us. We have studied the Bible thoroughly and we have read the leading classical Christian writings, including the church fathers&rsquo; writings, church history, Christian biographies, and the central messages given by the spiritual giants. The first thing we saw was the assurance of salvation. I consider the fifty-one messages I gave on God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in 1984 as a consummation of what the Lord has shown us in His recovery. I would like to present a brief conclusion of all the things that the Lord has shown us through these past sixty years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD EMBODIED,<br />
REALIZED, AND CONSUMMATED</h2>
<p>The first aspect of the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is concerning the Triune God. The Triune God is embodied in the Son, Christ Jesus. Our Savior, Christ Jesus, is nothing less than the very embodiment, not only of the Father, but of the entire God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; The Godhead is the very divine Trinity, comprising the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Our Savior, Jesus Christ, is the very embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<p>This wonderful Christ, who is the embodiment of the divine Trinity, is realized by the Spirit. In John 14 the embodiment of God tells us that He would ask the Father to send another Comforter (v. 16). This &ldquo;another Comforter&rdquo; is the very realization of the embodiment of God, so He is called the Spirit of reality (v. 17). He is the realization of the Lord Jesus Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In John 16:13-15 the embodiment of the Triune God, Jesus, tells us clearly that in the divine Trinity whatever the Father is and has is embodied in the Son, whatever the Son is and has is received by the Spirit, and whatever the Spirit receives is disclosed to the believers. The Triune God is embodied in the Son and this embodiment is realized by the Spirit who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. The processed Triune God is ultimately consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>The all-inclusive Spirit as the realization of Christ and as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaches us in two ways: in the essential way He comes into us and in the economical way He comes upon us. This is the first aspect of the vision in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow to reach us. Without a flow, the river can never reach anything. With a flow there will surely be a reaching. When the Spirit reaches us, the entire God reaches us. This reaching is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God in our experience of His dispensing. The Triune God is dispensing Himself into us by the Father being embodied in the Son and the Son being realized by the Spirit. The Spirit becomes the very reaching to us of the Triune God as His consummation for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEVEN MAJOR PROCESSES OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
TO PRODUCE THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>According to the second point of the vision we have received of the Lord, the Triune God has gone through seven major processes. The Son is the embodiment of God, the Spirit is the realization of the Son, and the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the divine Trinity by seven major steps taken by the processed Triune God: incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, the breathing of the life-giving Spirit into His chosen people, ascension, and the pouring out of Himself as the consummated Spirit upon His chosen people. By these seven steps the Triune God, being embodied, realized, and consummated, is dispensed into us for the producing of a unique thing in this universe&mdash;the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>With the eternal God, there is no element of time and space. With Him the Body has already been produced. The Triune God consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit is in the Body, and as such a Spirit He is upon the Body. We all need to see this great vision. By God being embodied, realized, and consummated through these seven steps, the Triune God has been dispensed into His chosen people who have been regenerated and built up together to form the Body of Christ. This Body is carrying out one thing&mdash;the propagation of the processed and consummated Triune God through the gospel for the increase of the Body.</p>
<p>The New Testament says that the Word who was God became flesh (John 1:1, 14). The entire God became flesh. The Triune God was in the womb of a human virgin. The Triune God was a babe born and put into a manger. No wonder Isaiah 9:6 tells us that a child is born to us whose name is the mighty God. The mighty God is the entire God. The Triune God was living in a carpenter&rsquo;s home for thirty years. While Jesus, the embodiment of the Triune God, was being crucified on the cross, essentially speaking the Triune God was passing through death. There are some strong implications in the New Testament which show us that while Jesus was dying on the cross, the Triune God was going through death (Acts 20:28; 1 John 1:7).</p>
<p>What was accomplished by His wonderful death is all-inclusive. This wonderful One died on the cross with at least seven qualifications: as the Lamb of God (John 1:29) He died to deal with our sin and sins (1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:26, 28; 1 Cor. 15:3); as a man in the flesh (John 1:14) He died in the form of fallen man, in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3), to condemn sin in the flesh and deal with the flesh; as the brass serpent (John 3:14; Num. 21:4-9) He died to bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head (Gen. 3:15) and to destroy him (Heb. 2:14), along with his satanic world (John 12:31), that all His believers may have eternal life (John 3:15-16); as the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45), the representative of the old man, He died to crucify our old man (Rom. 6:6); as the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15) He died on the cross as part of the old creation to terminate the entire old creation; as the Peacemaker (Eph. 2:14-15) He died to abolish all the ordinances and differences in living, customs, and habits between all kinds of peoples for the creation of the new man; finally, He died as a grain of wheat to release the divine life for His reproduction (John 12:24). All the negative things were crucified on the cross, through which God, the Triune God, went through death and did something to defeat His enemies. Colossians 2:14-15 indicates that while Jesus was dying on the cross, the evil angelic powers were struggling to frustrate that death. But the Triune God stripped them off and gained a victory over them.</p>
<p>This wonderful One then entered into resurrection and by this one action He became the life-giving Spirit, which He breathed essentially into His chosen people on the evening of His resurrection (John 20:22). Then He ascended to the heavens to be inaugurated into His universal position as the Head of all things (Eph. 1:22-23). He was made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36), He was crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9), and enthroned and given the kingship (Heb. 1:3; 12:2). He received all the authority of the universe. Then He poured out the economical Spirit, which actually is just Himself as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, upon His chosen ones who had already received Him essentially. This pouring out of Himself as the wonderful all-inclusive Spirit was the final step for the accomplishment of His work.</p>
<p>When we receive this wonderful One, we receive all of the seven major processes He passed through. We receive His incarnation, His human living, His crucifixion, His resurrection, His breathing of Himself into us as the Spirit, His ascension, and His pouring out of Himself as the wonderful all-inclusive Spirit upon us. Does He need to become a man again for you? Does He need to live on this earth for you again? Does He need to die for you again? Does He need to resurrect for you again? Does He need to breathe the Spirit again for you? Does He need to ascend for you again? Does He need to pour out the Spirit upon you again? The answer to these seven questions is all no. We all have to see this vision. Blessed are they who see such a vision! A person who has received such a vision has to be excited.</p>
<p>My Savior is the embodiment of the entire God. He became a man for me, He lived on this earth for me, He died on the cross for me, He resurrected for me, and He breathed the wonderful Spirit into me before I was born (John 20:22; 1 Pet. 1:3). He ascended into heaven for me and I ascended with Him before I was born (Eph. 2:6). Then He poured Himself out upon me as the Spirit before I was born (Acts 2:17-18, 33; 1 Cor. 12:13). These seven wonderful processes are the bequests of the New Testament. He has bequeathed all of these items as a great blessing of His divine New Testament. As believers, we have received all of these bequests.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
TO BRING THE DEGRADED CHURCH<br />
BACK TO THE ENJOYMENT OF HIMSELF<br />
FOR THE FINALIZATION OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>The revelation we have received as a heavenly vision also comprises a third item. This item can be seen in the book of Revelation. The Triune God embodied, realized, and consummated through seven major steps is now within us and upon us. We are wrapped up with Him, within and without. We are full of the divine water. Inside us is the Spirit as the drinking water and outside us is the Spirit as the baptizing water. Although this is altogether wonderful, the church became degraded. This is why the book of Revelation is needed.</p>
<p>Christ as the embodiment of God in the four Gospels was gentle, mild, meek, and loving. John, the writer of Revelation, could lie in the bosom of that loving One (John 13:23). In Revelation, though, this Christ is altogether different. He has seven eyes (Rev. 5:6) which are as a flame of fire (Rev. 1:14). This One is worthy to open the universal secret of God&rsquo;s economy (Rev. 5:2, 5). He is the One taking care of the churches as the High Priest trimming the lamps and filling the lamps with oil (Rev. 1:13). He is also the One who administrates this universe and is going to inherit, to take possession, of both the sea and the land (Rev. 10:2). He is the One who is coming back to establish God&rsquo;s government on this earth (Rev. 11:15).</p>
<p>The seven Spirits, as the intensification of the Triune God, are the seven eyes of the Lion-Lamb to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The Triune God was embodied in the Son, realized and consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit, and as the seven Spirits, the intensification of the Triune God in the book of Revelation, He finalizes His New Testament economy. The finalization of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is by the consummated Spirit as the sevenfold intensified Spirit, the intensification of the Triune God.</p>
<p>It is not adequate for us merely to see the first two points of the vision in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We must go further to see the third point of our vision which involves our facing and overcoming the situation of degradation in the church. In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord points out many ugly mixtures. While the church was progressing throughout history, many mixtures came in to corrupt the church. As the High Priest, Christ is trimming the burned out wicks of the lampstands. In another sense, He is purifying the degraded church from all of the different kinds of mixtures.</p>
<p>By His trimming, by His purifying, He graciously brings the degraded church back to the enjoyment of Himself, to the eating of the tree of life (2:7), to the eating of the hidden manna (2:17), and to feasting with Him (3:20). The result of the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3 is to bring back the degraded churches to the very enjoyment of this wonderful One. God&rsquo;s desire for man to eat the tree of life in Genesis 2 is fulfilled in the Lord&rsquo;s promise to the overcomer to eat of the tree of life. The tree of life today is in the church as God&rsquo;s garden, paradise. We are here eating the tree of life; however, we have not reached God&rsquo;s goal yet. We are traveling in the wilderness, and as we are traveling He is our daily manna. In the degradation of the churches He is no longer the open manna but the hidden manna. He is not the manna in the wilderness, but the manna within the Holy of Holies. We have to be brought back to the enjoyment of such an item&mdash;the hidden manna. Eventually, we will be brought back to the Lord as a feast. In the epistle to the church in Laodicea the Lord promises to dine with the one who opens the door to Him. To dine is not merely to eat one food, but the riches of a meal. This may refer to the eating of the rich produce of the good land of Canaan by the children of Israel (Josh. 5:10-12). We will enjoy all the rich produce of the good land which is the all-inclusive Christ. This is marvelous! What else can compare with this?</p>
<p>The finalization of God&rsquo;s economy will be the New Jerusalem with the tree of life in its center (Rev. 22:1-2). The tree of life has fruit and leaves. The leaves of the tree of life are for the healing of the nations who are not regenerated but restored. The regenerated believers eat the fruit of the tree of life, receiving Christ as their life and life supply inwardly, that they may enjoy the divine life for eternity; whereas the restored nations are healed by the leaves of the tree of life. The nations are restored miraculously, but we believers are sustained by life. We are not the nations, but we are the sons produced by regeneration and sustained by the enjoyment of the fruit of the tree of life, that is, by the very essence of the tree of life. We are now enjoying the New Jerusalem as the finalization of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. For eternity we will enjoy life and life alone. Leave the leaves to the nations. We will enjoy nothing else but life. This is our vision.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT OVEREMPHASIZING ANY ITEM OTHER THAN<br />
GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>My concern is that many of you have never gotten into these things and that you do not have any interest or any burden to teach people these things. Instead you may pick up one small item of the recovery and make it a big item. We must realize again that &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the content of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;the Triune God embodied, realized, and consummated and taking the seven steps of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, breathing Himself into His believers, ascension, and pouring Himself out to dispense Himself entirely into His people as a Body. In the finalization of His New Testament economy in the book of Revelation He is the seven Spirits, out from the eternal One, of the Redeemer, the intensification of the Triune God in the overcoming church, consummating in the golden lampstands and the New Jerusalem. We have to see this and we have to learn how to minister these things.</p>
<p>Justification by faith is not &ldquo;the thing,&rdquo; but it is one item in the Lord&rsquo;s progressive recovery of the basic truths. The matters related to the inner life are wonderful but even the inner life is not &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; Sanctification, the brotherhood, or the presbytery are not &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; Because some lovers of the Lord saw the light concerning the presbytery, they gave up the episcopal system and set up the presbytery to administrate the church. This is why we have elders in the church and not bishops. Even though the truth concerning the presbytery is wonderful, this is not &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; I am for baptism by immersion, but immersion is not &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; Even the church practice is not &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not oppose the gifts, including the speaking in tongues. What I am against is the overemphasis of the so-called miraculous gifts. To overemphasize is wrong. This overemphasis can become a cancer in the Body. If the cells in a human body are balanced and dispensed properly, this is altogether healthy. But when the cells are &ldquo;over-emphasized&rdquo; in a certain spot of the body, that spot becomes a cancer and kills the body. The overemphasis of the so-called miraculous gifts becomes a cancer to the Body of Christ. A cancer is not a sickness of any germs. It is not a sickness of wrong things. Cancer is a sickness of &ldquo;right things.&rdquo; John 2:23-24 tells us that the Lord would not trust in the seekers of miracles. To exalt the miraculous gifts to the uttermost and to overemphasize them in the way of Pentecostalism is wrong and is a cancer to the Body which we cannot take.</p>
<p>The second thing that I am against is the falsehood of today&rsquo;s tongue-speaking. Most of today&rsquo;s speaking in tongues is not a genuine dialect. As one who ministers the Word and who speaks for God, I feel burdened about this matter. I have been studying this matter for over fifty years. Most of today&rsquo;s tongue-speaking is humanly manufactured because many people were taught to speak in tongues. I am not opposed to the genuine tongues, but I am against the speaking in tongues that is humanly manufactured. Many of the tongue-speakers reconcile themselves by saying that there is no need to speak a genuine dialect when one speaks in tongues. Acts 2:4 and 8 tell us, however, that the disciples who were Galileans spoke the different foreign dialects of the attendants who came from various parts of the world. This is strong proof that tongue-speaking must be an understandable language, not merely a voice or sound uttered by the tongue.</p>
<p>One writer of a certain Christian publication said that he had contacted two hundred tongue-speakers. After checking with all of them, they all said that they doubted as to whether or not the tongue they were speaking was genuine. There was not one exception to this among these two hundred. The writer of this article, who was a promoter of tongue-speaking, then indicated that you should not doubt but believe that whatever you say is a genuine tongue. Surely the ones who spoke in tongues on the day of Pentecost did not have any doubt that what they were speaking was a genuine dialect, an understandable language. Can we preach, teach, or minister something false? Surely we cannot!</p>
<p>Although I do not agree with the falsity of many of the miraculous things in the Pentecostal movement, we must be clear that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is all-inclusive. It includes tongue-speaking. Do not make an issue of it. If you say we would not take tongue-speaking, this is wrong. If you do this, you make an issue of tongue-speaking and you are sectarian. Neither should the brothers who are for tongue-speaking make an issue of it. Even the proper, most genuine tongue-speaking is just one little item in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It is not &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; If you make any one item such as the presbytery so big and overemphasize it, I am against this. But I am not against the presbytery.</p>
<p>The saints in one certain locality did not practice taking the Lord&rsquo;s table. However, we did not reject them because they would not take the Lord&rsquo;s table in our way. We still loved them and recognized them as a local church. Even the way of the Lord&rsquo;s table according to the Bible was a small discovery. But we should not uplift the Lord&rsquo;s table as &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; In spite of our way of having the Lord&rsquo;s table, this certain locality still recognized us as local churches and we recognized them as a local church. Recently, this particular locality began to practice the Lord&rsquo;s table according to what the Bible reveals. We rejoice in this, but we would never make this practice an issue. If you exclude those who speak in tongues or if you make an issue of speaking in tongues, you are sectarian. For some saints or even some churches to speak in tongues is not sinful. Even if what they speak is not the genuine tongue, it should be only considered as wrong, but not sinful. Whether you speak in tongues or whether you do not speak in tongues, you should not make an issue. Romans 14 teaches us that we should receive one another according to God&rsquo;s receiving and not according to doctrinal concepts. Whatever we do we should do it unto the Lord. We have to receive each other and we have to respect and regard each other. What I am against is the overemphasis of minor points and the neglecting of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Throughout church history, many missionaries were sent out by the Lord and some of them did much wonderful work. These particular missionaries preached the gospel and taught the Bible. One of them, Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, was not related to the Pentecostal movement, but he did a marvelous work in China to bring the gospel and the Lord&rsquo;s name there. Some among the Pentecostals say that if you do not speak in tongues, you have never been baptized in the Holy Ghost. I do not believe this according to the pure word of the Bible and according to my experience. Although Hudson Taylor and many others were quite powerful in the Lord&rsquo;s work, they never spoke in tongues. I also am not an advocate of the so-called baptism in the Holy Spirit according to the Pentecostal understanding, but in the past sixty years, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, the Lord has raised up approximately six hundred churches through the ministry the Lord has committed me with. This is why I am strong against any overemphasis of minor doctrines and practices. Cells are good and necessary. Our body needs the cells, but if a certain cell becomes exalted and enlarged it becomes a cancer. We should not have any exaltation of small items in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The only exaltation should be given to the New Testament economy of God. We can never overly exalt or overemphasize God&rsquo;s New Testament economy because His economy is all-inclusive. I do have a heart for all the saints, so I must be frank and faithful to them. I do not like to see any of you led astray. As one who ministers the Lord&rsquo;s Word in His recovery, I have to take care of the saints and bear the burden for them. This is why I want you to &ldquo;regulate your driving.&rdquo; If you &ldquo;go across the white line&rdquo; you will either kill yourself or kill others. You need the vision to control you and restrain you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STUDYING, SPEAKING, AND TEACHING THE THINGS<br />
CONCERNING GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>I would encourage all the saints, especially the young ones among us, to spend time to get into the contents of the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, which is the New Testament economy of God. You need to get into how the Triune God is embodied, realized, consummated, intensified, and finalized. You need to study all the seven major steps of the divine move: incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, breathing, ascension, and pouring out. You need to study the intensification of the Triune God in the book of Revelation finalizing His New Testament economy by bringing the degraded church back to the enjoyment of Himself. You need to get all these things into your being thoroughly. Then you need to labor on them to help all the saints. This is my burden. From now on I hope that in all the church meetings nothing is talked about but the content of the New Testament economy of God. The leading ones need to teach God&rsquo;s economy to all the members in their locality. Even the young ones among us can speak these things concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Then the Lord will have a way to really carry out His all-inclusive recovery for the building up of His church. If you merely stay in one of the items you have experienced even in a genuine way, you miss the mark. You should not stay with any item. You should only stay with this central thing, &ldquo;the thing&rdquo;&mdash;the content of the New Testament economy of God. I hope this is clear to all of us.</p>
<p>Before the Lord, I can say honestly that I love each one of you brothers. You do not know how much I pray for you when I am concerned for you. I have no intention of condemning or offending any one of you. I really love all of you because you have left so many things for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and you have even designated yourself for the Lord&rsquo;s move in this country. Although I treasure this, I cannot be silent when I see the things you are getting involved in leading you astray from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. I must sound the trumpet. You have to take care of the &ldquo;white line&rdquo; while you are driving. Without the vision we may run wild. We may unconsciously cast off the restraints. Thank the Lord, though, that His Word is with us. If there were no Bible, no holy Word, on this earth, where would we be? We have to come back to His holy Word. The controlling, restraining vision is conveyed to us through the holy Word.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">COMING TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE<br />
OF THE TRUTH</h1>
<p>In this chapter I would like to consider some verses from 1 Timothy. Verse 4 of chapter two says that God &ldquo;desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo; Then 1 Timothy 3:2 says that an elder must be apt to teach. Verse 9 of the same chapter says that a deacon must be holding the mystery of the faith, that is of what we believe, in a pure conscience. In verses 15 and 16 of chapter three are four main things: the church as the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, the great mystery of godliness, and the manifestation of God in the flesh. These four things are wrapped up with the truth. Actually, the truth is the very element of this portion of the Word. First Timothy 5:17 says, &ldquo;Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; To labor is to toil. An elder should be such a one who labors in word and teaching. In 1 Timothy 6:3 Paul tells us that we have to restrict ourselves to the healthy words, especially the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which is according to godliness, that is, God expressed through us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE WORD IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>I hope that you would study all of the crucial verses in the New Testament concerning the divine Word. A number of these crucial verses concerning the Word are listed on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/EldrsTrng5/elders-trng5-pg36.html">page 36</a>. In these verses, first, the Word of God is actually God Himself. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word&rdquo; (John 1:1). In John 1:14 this Word became flesh. God&rsquo;s incarnation is the embodiment of the divine Word. God as the Word needs an embodiment, and this embodiment is a living Person, Jesus Christ our Lord. He is not only the embodiment of God, but also the embodiment of God as the divine Word.</p>
<p>In John 6 the Lord tells us that the words spoken by Him are spirit (v. 63). The Word was God, the Word became embodied, and the words spoken out of the mouth of this embodiment are spirit. Then this word is life. &ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (John 6:63). The divine Word is God as the Spirit and as life. The Word is also the seed of life sown into a certain kind of soil (Mark 4:14; Matt. 13:19). Peter said we were regenerated through this word (1 Pet. 1:23). The word is the seed of life and this life regenerated us. In Matthew 4:4, the Lord said that &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; This was spoken by the Lord as a quotation of the Old Testament (Deut. 8:3), telling us that man&rsquo;s real food is the word of God. The New Testament tells us further that this word is the implanted word (James 1:21). This also denotes something of life. Second Thessalonians 3:1 says the word of God can run and can be glorified. The Word is a living Person. Paul also asks the Colossians to pray for him &ldquo;that God may open to us a door for the word&rdquo; (4:3). The word needs a door, and much prayer is needed to have the door opened for the word. Eventually the word is a sword, a weapon, for fighting (Eph. 6:17). Lastly, the book of Revelation mentions several times the word of God and the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:2, 9; 6:9; 20:4). John was exiled on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. Even the martyrs were martyred because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</p>
<p>In Acts we are told three times that the word grew and that the word multiplied (Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20). A lifeless thing can never grow but the word grows. Actually, the multiplication of the disciples depends upon the growth of the word. However, many who read Acts would mostly pay their attention to the Spirit. No doubt, the Spirit is stressed in Acts. But those who received the Spirit did not go out and preach the Spirit. Rather, they preached the word. Many verses in Acts tell us that what was preached and taught by the first group of believers was the word. The scattered ones in Acts 8 went out to bring the good news of the word (v. 1). People believed in the word, received the word, and the word became so prevailing in that it grew and multiplied. In Acts 12 is a very meaningful contrast. King Herod was persecuting the church and especially Peter, but eventually Herod died (v. 23). Right after his death Acts 12:24 says, &ldquo;But the word of God grew and multiplied.&rdquo; The persecutor died but the word grew.</p>
<p>I want to impress you that the divine Word is what we really need and we should be one with the Word, full of the Word, saturated with the Word, and constituted with the Word. Then when we minister, we minister the Word by the Spirit. We do not minister the Spirit by the Word, but we minister the Word by the Spirit. In chapter four of Acts, while the disciples and the apostles were praying, they were filled with the Spirit and began to speak the word with boldness (Acts 4:31). They did not teach or preach the Spirit; the Spirit was only the power for them to preach the word.</p>
<p>Hebrews 6:4 tells us that the believers are partakers of the Holy Spirit. Then the next verse says they taste two things, the good word of God and the works of power of the coming age. Here are two kinds of tasting. The first class of tasting is of the good word of God. What is the good word of God? Hebrews 6:1 speaks of &ldquo;the word of the beginning of the Christ.&rdquo; In Hebrews 5:13-14 is the word of righteousness, which is not milk but solid food. This indicates that the good word of God in chapter six is the milk which is for the babes in chapter five. This corresponds with Peter&rsquo;s word in 1 Peter 2:2: &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word.&rdquo; The good word of God is milk, liquid food. But there is still another higher category of the word of God, the word of righteousness.</p>
<p>In the Life-study of Hebrews we have covered this thoroughly. The good word of God mainly refers to the gospel concerning the Lord&rsquo;s earthly ministry from His incarnation up to His resurrection. This first part of the gospel concerning Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry is considered as the good word of God. The Hebrews, the receivers of this book, had the good word of God, but they were short of a further taste, the taste of the word of righteousness referring to the heavenly ministry of Christ. The book of Hebrews conveys to us the heavenly ministry of Christ. It talks about Christ passing through the heavens (4:14) and entering into the heavenly tabernacle to be the heavenly minister and the heavenly High Priest (8:1-2) to minister heaven into us that we might be a heavenly people answering the heavenly call (3:1). The ministry of Christ has two parts. From His incarnation to His resurrection is His earthly ministry. After He ascended to the heavens, He began His heavenly ministry. Today&rsquo;s preaching in Christianity very rarely touches this heavenly ministry. What is preached is at most just the good word of God, but not the word of righteousness. The word of righteousness is the solid food referring not to the Christ on this earth, but to the Christ in the heavens. The taste of the works of power of the coming age does not go with the word of righteousness, but with the good word of God, referring to the beginning of the gospel. Try to study all these verses in the New Testament concerning the word.</p><h2 class="head1">COMING TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE<br />
OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>My burden is to share with you concerning the biggest shortage among us today. The biggest shortage is that the elders are short of the full knowledge of the truth. I appreciate 1 Timothy in that it deals with the matter of the truth. In John 17:17 the Lord prayed, &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&rdquo; The truth, the word, not only regenerates, feeds, and enlightens, but it sanctifies. God desires all men, after being saved, to come to the full knowledge of the truth. No need to say all men, I even doubt all the elders in the recovery have come to the full knowledge of the truth. We should not merely have the knowledge of the truth, but the full knowledge, the complete knowledge, the perfect knowledge, of the truth. In the 1984 elders&rsquo; training thirty-six messages were given. I really doubt that you have entered into the full knowledge of those truths which were delivered to you then. If we have never been constituted with this knowledge, then how could we speak? How could we preach? How could we teach?</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING APT TO TEACH</h2>
<p>Paul charged the elders in the church in this way: if you are going to be an elder, you must build up a habit to teach, to be apt to teach. Being apt to teach is a kind of habit. How about the elders today? Are you apt to teach? This really concerns me. Please give me mercy to say that I do not care for how much Spirit you have; I care for how much you can teach. I do not care for how much gift you have gained or how much you can speak in tongues; I care for how much you can teach the solid truth. Do you not realize that without the Word the Spirit is just in vain? You can never separate the Word from the Spirit. Firstly, in John 6:63 we are told that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit. Then in Ephesians 6:17 we are told that the Spirit is the word. According to the Greek text, the antecedent of the relative pronoun &ldquo;which&rdquo; in this verse is the Spirit, not the sword; &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Generally speaking, those in the Pentecostal movement do not pay attention to the Word. Their attention is fully occupied by their thought of the Spirit. They do not see that without the Word, the Spirit is in vain. We all have to realize the Spirit comes after the Word. The Gospel of John begins with the Word. In the beginning was the Word, not the Spirit, and the Word was God. This Word which was God became flesh, the very embodiment of the Word. Then when He speaks, His words are spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RAISED UP IN THE WAY OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>We have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for over sixty years. We were not raised up in a nonsensical way without any knowledge of the truth. The Lord raised us up altogether in the way of the truth. The missionaries who were there in China testified that among all the Christians in China we were on the top in knowing the truth. They were even surprised, and marveled that we, the young Chinese natives, could expound the Bible in such a wonderful way.</p>
<p>In 1934 when I was staying in Shanghai the church there decided one day to have a special gospel preaching meeting. I was happy, waiting to hear Brother Nee preach the gospel. Just a short time before the meeting I got a note from him, delivered by another brother. The note said, &ldquo;Witness, please preach the gospel tonight.&rdquo; I was staying above the meeting hall. When I received the note, we were getting ready to eat, and after eating we would go to the meeting. By that time no one knew where Brother Nee had gone, so I had no choice but to give the message.</p>
<p>Shortly before the meeting started, the burden came to me to preach the gospel from John 16 using the verses concerning the coming of the Spirit of reality to convict the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment (John 16:8-11). The light came and I went to the meeting. I spoke on this portion of the Word telling them, &ldquo;You can see three things in this portion of the Word: sin, righteousness, and judgment. You all have to realize sin refers to one person, righteousness refers to another person, and judgment refers to a third person. Each of the three things refer to one person, respectively. Sin refers to Adam. You were born in Adam and you were born in sin. That is your status. Righteousness refers to Christ who died for your sins, and who resurrected and went to the Father for your justification. You were born in Adam to have sin. Now you need to have a transfer. Get out of Adam and get into Christ. Then you will have righteousness instead of sin. If you do not do this, you are just waiting for another person, Satan. Judgment refers to Satan, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire. That will be his destiny. If you do not have the transfer out of Adam into Christ, you will share the judgment of Satan for eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I was speaking I looked around, but I could not see Brother Nee. Much later as we were taking a walk one day he turned to me and said, &ldquo;Witness, that night when you gave the message on John 16, I was standing outside the door behind where you stood to give the message. Probably very few, if any, Christian teachers in our country can teach people the Bible in your way. I encourage you to teach people the Bible in this way.&rdquo; I say this to show you that we were raised up by the Lord by the way of the Word, not by the way of the Spirit &ldquo;in the air.&rdquo; We were raised up by the Lord in the solid Word. If I, as a preacher, have some power, then that power must be in the Word. Most of you were attracted by the ministry of the Word, not by the Spirit.</p>
<p>But thank the Lord, where the Word is there is the Spirit. The Word is the embodiment of the invisible, abstract, and mysterious Spirit. The Spirit is too mysterious, too abstract, too invisible. Without the Word as the embodiment of the Spirit, no one can touch the Spirit. Therefore, as elders, I encourage you all, I even beg you all to get yourselves saturated, constituted with the Word. Your entire being must be a constitution of the holy Word. For more than sixty years I have been in the Word. This is why the ministry is here, the ministry of riches, of life, of power, and of light.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING AND MINISTERING<br />
THE MYSTERY OF GODLINESS</h2>
<p>I believe this is why the Apostle Paul, after writing Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews, wrote 1 Timothy in such a way. He was so experienced. He knew the secret of how to take care of the church under degradation. For this reason, in this book he stressed the truth, the word. He said God &ldquo;desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth&rdquo; (2:4). He also said the church, which is the house of the living God, is the pillar and base of the truth (3:15). The truth is the mystery of godliness, and this mystery of godliness is the manifestation of the Triune God. This means that, as a church, surely all the members have to know the manifestation of the Triune God, to know the mystery of godliness, to know the truth. The truth in 1 Timothy 2:4 is not the truth mainly concerning baptism, nor the truth mainly concerning the gifts, but the truth concerning the Triune God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>Can the elders teach such a truth concerning the embodiment of the Triune God and the realization of this embodiment, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God? You may think it is wonderful to teach a little about justification by faith, about holiness, and concerning the gifts. That is not the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The church is the pillar and base of the truth. It is not mainly the truth of items such as the presbytery, baptism, or even the smaller item of the miraculous gifts. The truth, of which the church is the pillar and base, is a great truth&mdash;the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh through the church. A proper church is the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh.</p>
<p>We should take care of such a truth. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has brought us thus far to this point. Items like baptism and the gifts are more than elementary, something in the stage of kindergarten. Where are we now? We are in the embodiment of the Triune God realized by the all-inclusive Spirit who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. You may say that you are in the recovery, that you are one with the ministry, and that you are for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony today, but where are you actually? I propose that we have a time for desperate prayer. It is worthwhile to fast and pray. Fast and pray that the Lord would open your eyes to see such a vision of the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh through the church. Then you will have a vision and this vision will govern, direct, control, preserve, and protect you from being led astray. Then you will have the solid Word to minister to the churches.</p>
<p>This is what we all need. We are no longer in kindergarten. The new believers among us, no doubt, are still in kindergarten, but as a whole, the recovery today is not in kindergarten. We have carried out the standard education passing through kindergarten, elementary, junior high, and even high school. Today we are at least in college. To stress anything low is to bring the recovery back to kindergarten. The standard of education in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not that low today. Fifty-two years ago it was, but not today. I say this based on the thirty-six messages I delivered to you in the 1984 elders&rsquo; training. I encourage you to get a copy of these messages and at least to read through them once, but I also hope that you would study them, especially the first two books on the ministry of the New Testament and on the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If possible you should study all four books. I believe that anyone who reads these messages fairly would say that this is the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date present word to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING IN THE WORD AND TEACHING</h2>
<p>I would ask the elders, who should be apt to teach and who should labor in word and in teaching, what they would teach. To answer this question you have to go back to some of the verses in 1 Timothy. The truth in 1 Timothy 2:4 refers to the mystery of godliness which is the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh. Paul also charged the deacons to hold the mystery of the faith (3:9). If I were to ask some deacons to tell us what the mystery of the faith is, they might not be able. Is faith in this verse the believing ability, the believing act, the so-called subjective faith, or is this objective faith, referring to the things we believe in? Even some elders may not know this.</p>
<p>This is why I have a deep and heavy concern for all the brothers in the leadership. Do we all really labor? To labor is not just to work but to toil. If the elders would be laboring in the Word and in teaching, I believe that all the local churches would be wonderful. To labor in the Spirit and forget about the Word only results in confusion and vanity. The Southern Baptists would not allow their pastors to emphasize the Spirit. They labor on the Word and forget about the Spirit. In the Pentecostal movement they labor on the Spirit and forget about the Word. Which result is higher? The Southern Baptists are the largest denomination in the United States. This is the result of taking the Word first.</p>
<p>We would not take the way of the Southern Baptists or the way of the Pentecostals. The way we would take is to focus on the Word by the Spirit. This is the right way. In the Bible the Word is first and not the Spirit. The entire New Testament points to the Word first; then you come to the Spirit. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word.&rdquo; Do not forget this. Then out of this Word comes the Spirit. The Spirit is the consummation of the Word. The Spirit is not the foundation or the source. We have to see this. I like the Spirit because the Spirit is my enjoyment; the Spirit does every work for me. With the Word, however, I have to labor. I have to labor on book after book, chapter after chapter, and item after item. To pick up all the verses on the divine Word from the twenty-seven books of the New Testament requires a lot of labor. This is what you should do. Do not expect that you could build up the church &ldquo;in the air.&rdquo; The church could only be built up on the truth. Otherwise, it could never be the pillar and base of the truth. We all have to labor in the Word and in teaching, and we all have to hold the mystery of the faith, the mystery of what we believe in.</p>
<p>The cause of all the problems among us has been the shortage of the full knowledge of the truth. A shortage of the knowledge of the truth means ignorance, blindness, and darkness. Without electricity in the room enabling the lights to shine, we would make a lot of blunders in the darkness; we would do a lot of nonsensical things. This is why I have a real burden that we would all reconsider our situation. It is altogether a pitiful thing to remain in darkness. This is why we began this training with Acts 26:19 and Proverbs 29:18. We need the heavenly vision because without this vision we will run wild. We need the full knowledge of the truth.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING CONSTITUTED<br />
WITH THE MAJOR TRUTHS</h2>
<p>Let us now consider the practicality of being constituted with the truth. The highest truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the truth concerning the Trinity. This is the highest truth of the Bible. The first noun used as a subject in the Bible is God. &ldquo;In the beginning God created&rdquo; (Gen. 1:1). &ldquo;God&rdquo; in this verse indicates the Trinity since the Hebrew word for God (Elohim) is plural in number. In that same chapter God said to Himself, &ldquo;Let us (plural) make man in our image&rdquo; (v. 26). The Trinity is also here. Also, the structure of the entire New Testament is the Triune God. This is the highest truth. Because this truth is mysterious, however, it is hard for people to apprehend. For this reason, clever people try their best to avoid it. However, years ago in the recovery the Lord began to show us that the Trinity is not just a doctrinal matter. The Trinity is for us to enjoy our very God. &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:14). This is not a doctrine, but the very Trinity for you to enjoy&mdash;Christ, God, and the Spirit. This one verse involves these three divine Persons. Many Christians only have an objective Triune God far away from them. They do not care for the experience of the Triune God, yet they use 2 Corinthians 13:14 as a benediction given on Sunday mornings.</p>
<p>The Lord has shown us that the divine Trinity is not for doctrine. He is for our enjoyment, and He has begun to bring us into the enjoyment of Himself. Since the recovery came to this country and I began to minister, many messages have been given on this one thing. Some even consider that the divine Trinity is my hobby. Though I have spoken much and have printed many messages, I am a little concerned for you brothers. I doubt that many of you have entered into the complete truth of the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>As a young boy the first time I ever went to any kind of Christian chapel was on Christmas eve. The first thing I saw was Santa Claus and some &ldquo;big socks,&rdquo; Christmas stockings. My mother told me that was the celebration of Christmas concerning the Lord&rsquo;s birth. She had already told me how Jesus was born of a virgin and how He was put into a manger. In all of Christianity they celebrate the Lord&rsquo;s birth and they teach the Lord&rsquo;s birth, but nearly no one has ever studied what the conception is. In our training on Luke we defined how the conception was initiated by the divine element entering into the womb of the human virgin to be mingled with the human element. Eventually what was born was a God-man, born of two elements, the divine and the human. Things like this we have studied and have put in writing. Suppose you would be asked what the conception of Jesus Christ is. You may say, &ldquo;Well, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit in a virgin.&rdquo; Then some thoughtful person would ask, &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; You might answer, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s hard to say.&rdquo; This is not the adequate answer. We are talking about the incarnation of the Triune God. We have to know how He was incarnated and we have to teach people. This has very much to do with the laying of a good foundation for the saints to enjoy the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>Even as a young boy, I was told by my mother that Jesus was so good, that He did a lot of miracles, and that He was so humble and meek. But nearly no one, according to my knowledge, ever studied the human living of Jesus. Was that a man&rsquo;s living or was that God&rsquo;s living? If you say that was God&rsquo;s living, then I would ask, &ldquo;What kind of God? Was that just the Son or the Father or the Spirit?&rdquo; By His mercy we have studied to such an extent that we can say that His living was the living of a God-man who is the Son of God with the Father by the Spirit. Just these two prepositional phrases, &ldquo;with the Father&rdquo; and &ldquo;by the Spirit&rdquo; require at least one week of study. You have to find the verses that prove that when Jesus was living on this earth, even as a carpenter in a poor house, He lived as the Son with the Father (John 8:16, 29; 16:32). You also have to be able to prove that He lived by the Spirit (Matt. 4:1; 12:28; Luke 4:18a). There is the need of such a thorough study of the holy Word.</p>
<p>Then, when He reached the age of thirty and before He began to minister, He was baptized. After being baptized in water He stood up, the Holy Spirit as a dove descended upon Him, and the Father spoke from the heavens (Matt. 3:16-17). Was Jesus not conceived of the Holy Spirit? Was He not born of the Holy Spirit? Then why at His baptism did the Holy Spirit descend upon Him and the Father speak from the heavens? It is not so easy to answer this question. But thank the Lord, in His mercy He showed us. In His light we have picked up two terms, the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity. The Lord Jesus was born of the Spirit essentially, but the Spirit&rsquo;s descending upon Him and the Father&rsquo;s speaking from above was something economical.</p>
<p>Then following this, He worked in the same way as He lived&mdash;with the Father by the Spirit. Then He went to the cross. Who went to the cross? Who died there? Who was crucified? Who was nailed on the cross? Could God be nailed there? On what basis could you have the boldness to tell people God was crucified there? Acts 20:28 says that God obtained the church with His own blood. If God never died on the cross how could He shed His blood? You may say that you cannot understand this. Actually, there are many things that we cannot understand. Even you cannot understand yourself. You cannot understand the food you eat every day. Do not take the excuse that you cannot understand. That God has shed His blood is a fact recorded in the Bible.</p>
<p>First John 1:7 speaks of &ldquo;the blood of Jesus His Son.&rdquo; The blood is of a person with two elements. As Jesus, He is a person who is constituted with the human element. As the Son of God He is constituted with the divine element. Without the divine element His redemption could never be eternal, and the efficacy of the power of His redemption would not be insured. As a man He could only die for one person, but as the eternal God with the eternal element, His death is for millions of people. His death is an eternal death, His redemption an eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12). He was dying with the eternal, divine element. Hebrews 9:14 tells us that He offered Himself through the eternal Spirit. What does this mean? Is this the eternal essential Spirit or the eternal economical Spirit?</p>
<p>We need to jump out of the shallow way of understanding the truth. We should not be those &ldquo;skating on the ice&rdquo; of the truth. We need to break the ice and get into the depths of the truth. This requires much labor. You need to study the Bible, to study the proper reference books, and to study thousands of pages in the Life-study Messages. You need to study the messages, not just to read through them as if you were reading a newspaper. You have a good heart to put the Life-studies on your shelves, but what has entered into you? What has been constituted into your being?</p>
<p>In the last chapter of Revelation the Lord told us He would come soon (Rev. 22:12). Two thousand years have passed, and He has not come yet. Who delayed Him? We delayed Him. The believers delayed Him by ignorance, by not having a full knowledge of the truth. Under the ignorance of all the believers, the Lord just could not find a way to go on. This ignorance is still prevailing today. Darkness is everywhere. Where is the sky clear and where is the real enlightenment? There may be a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of excitement, but no light. This kind of excitement is under darkness, and anything that is under darkness is nonsense.</p>
<p>According to this present situation the Lord nearly has no way to go on. The first thing He has to do is to shine. In His old creation, the first item He brought in was light. &ldquo;Let there be light&rdquo; (Gen. 1:3). We need the enlightenment. His word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path (Psa. 119:105) and the entrance of His words gives light (Psa. 119:130). We need much proper apprehension of the word of the truth which is the real light to us. We need the enlightenment; then we could see the real significance of His incarnation, of His human living, and of His death. On the cross He died an all-inclusive death with seven aspects. (See message 53 of the Life-study of Luke, pp. 459-462). Could you speak this without any preparation? To do this you need a constitution of all these points of the truth. Then it is so easy for you to present the seven aspects of the all-inclusive death of Christ.</p>
<p>Instead of caring for this we may care for the shallow things, the superficial things. Who cares for the deep things today? Saints, are we really in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? Do we really mean business? If so, then why do we not have any interest in these deeper things of the divine economy? It is not a small matter to know the death of Christ in an all-inclusive way, but who would labor to study these things? Actually, someone has labored already. All these matters have been put into print. It only requires you to have a heart to spend about twenty minutes, then you would get every aspect of this all-inclusive death constituted into your being. You read about the aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s death in the Life-studies but nothing is left within you. These things come and go. This is the tragedy in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Anyone who teaches without the proper knowledge of the truth will make a lot of trouble. After having cataracts and cataract surgery twice I am now unqualified to drive a car. If you ask me to drive, I will drive in a nonsensical way. For you to travel to various places to minister the Word without the proper knowledge of the truth is like a blind man driving a car. You are traveling and doing the work, but you do not know how much damage you have caused. You are enthusiastic to do the work of the Lord, but how do you do the work? With what do you do the work? What do you preach? What do you teach? These are big questions.</p>
<p>In the same principle, what do the responsible ones teach the saints in their locality? I would propose that we all take care of and study three items. The first is the Triune God embodied in Christ, and the Spirit being His realization and also the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. The second is the seven major steps taken by our Triune God: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, breathing the Spirit, ascension, and pouring out the Spirit. Then, let us study as the third item the finalization of the intensification of the Triune God as the sevenfold intensified Spirit. I hope that all the elders would be constituted with these truths. Then we could be apt to teach these things. This does not mean that we no longer need the lessons for the new beginners. We are still bringing forth a number of new ones so we need lessons for them. Brothers, will you take this proposal? I assure you that it will cost you at least two or three months to get into these major and basic truths.</p><h2 class="head1">ADVANCING IN THE DEEPER<br />
AND HIGHER TRUTHS</h2>
<p>The brothers who are going out as the gospel team in these days have set up a good example. These brothers are going out, not to preach a shallow gospel, but rather to preach the higher gospel, even to preach the Triune God to people. The entire situation of Christians has remained in shallowness for centuries. To continue in that is easy, but for us to go out to preach the gospel with the deeper truths is somewhat of an uphill battle. The shallow things could never stir up people&rsquo;s attention. Especially in such a leading country as this, people are tired of listening to the old shallow things. Due to this, many preachers tried their best to create stories and illustrations to stir up people&rsquo;s interest. Actually, not much reality of the bequests of the New Testament is preached as the glad tidings. But now, the brothers going out have preached the riches of the bequests of the New Testament. It is no wonder that so many love to hear this. Thank the Lord for this.</p>
<p>What I desire to see is not just some brothers going out as a team to preach these deeper things, but that all the elders would rise up to learn the deeper things and to teach the deeper things. I assure you, you will see the result. You will labor less and reap more. When you sow the rich seed, your harvest surely will be rich. If you sow the poor seed, regardless of how much you labor, the harvest eventually will not be that rich because what you sow is poor. Do not take the easy way or go the short-cut way. It is wise to take the proper way. Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery the proper way is to care for these deeper truths.</p>
<p>The deeper truths in 1 Corinthians do not include Christ as our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. These items are all mentioned in chapter one of 1 Corinthians (v. 30). In chapter two Paul speaks of &ldquo;the depths of God&rdquo; (v. 10). Surely in the following chapters there are things deeper than righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. For instance, 6:17 tells us that we can be joined to the Lord as one spirit. How deep this is! Years ago I read quite a few books on Christ being our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. Probably even in the first year after being born again, I read books of this kind, but I never read a book telling people that they could be one spirit with the Lord. Then in chapter seven Paul said, &ldquo;I give my opinion&rdquo; (v. 25). It seems this is very shallow, yet in this chapter a deeper truth is conveyed. Even in giving his opinion, eventually in the last verse of the chapter he said, &ldquo;I think that I also have the Spirit of God&rdquo; (v. 40). Could you explain the truth that is here? How could giving one&rsquo;s opinion be having the Spirit of God? This is a deeper truth. Even the headship taught in chapter eleven is much deeper than righteousness. Could you explain how God is the head of Christ, Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman (11:3)? This is also a deeper truth.</p>
<p>This book of deeper truths also contains a lot of shallow things such as lawsuits, fornication, and idol worship. I read books concerning these things, but very few books have come out that tell us all these deeper things. In chapter ten is the table of the Lord and in chapter eleven is the Lord&rsquo;s supper. There is a difference between these two things. How could you have the fellowship of the blood of Christ by taking the cup of wine? How could you have the very fellowship with all the saints by partaking of the bread? This is much deeper than Christ being our righteousness. Then, going on further, you have the deeper truth concerning Christ becoming a life-giving Spirit (15:45). Who understands this? Who today is teaching that we can live in resurrection?</p>
<p>Furthermore, because the Christians lack a view of the deeper truths, they interpreted chapters twelve and fourteen in a very shallow way. If you have the view of the deeper truths, you can see that what Paul is talking about in these two chapters is not that shallow. Could you tell me what the difference is between the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge (12:8)? These are the first two aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit. The two highest aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit are the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge. The third one is faith, the fourth is healing, the fifth is miracles or works of power, the next is the discernment of spirits, and the last are tongues and their interpretation. The first two are the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge, and the last two are tongues and interpretation of tongues (12:8-10). Could you explain why Paul put tongues and interpretation of tongues as the last two items and why he exalted the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge to be on the top? To speak in tongues is a shallow thing, but to give a word of wisdom or a word of knowledge is much deeper. Of course, this knowledge is not the knowledge of science or of politics, but the knowledge of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. To speak the word of wisdom you need a lot of experience of the all-inclusive Christ. This is why we may be able to speak in tongues and practice so-called healings, but we cannot speak the word of wisdom or the word of knowledge because this is much higher and much deeper. It is easy to be an elementary student in kindergarten, but to be one in graduate school is not that easy. To speak the word of wisdom and to speak the word of knowledge is like being in graduate school.</p>
<p>The word of wisdom is the word concerning Christ as the deeper things of God predestined by God for our portion (1:24, 30; 2:6-10). The word of knowledge is the word that imparts a general knowledge of things concerning God and the Lord (8:1-7). The word of wisdom is mainly of our spirit through revelation; the word of knowledge is mainly of our understanding through teaching. The former is deeper than the latter. However, both of them, not the speaking in tongues nor any other miraculous gift, are listed as the first and topmost aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit because both are the most profitable ministries or services for the edification of the saints and the building up of the church to carry out God&rsquo;s operation.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation&rdquo; (v. 26). In chapters twelve and fourteen Paul was trying his best to uplift the Corinthians from their low estate to a higher one. The Corinthians were too low and too shallow (3:2-3). In these days, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we should try to leave our kindergarten state. Why would we not go further and higher? We surely need to advance.</p>
<p>The problem with the Corinthians was the same as that with the Hebrews. In Hebrews, as I mentioned already, Paul says clearly that we need to advance, to leave the word of the beginning of the Christ (Heb. 6:1). According to the entire book of Hebrews, the word of the beginning of the Christ concerns Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry. Though we may consider His conception or His incarnation so deep, Paul says that is something at the beginning. You have to go higher from the earth to the heavens, from the good word of God to the word of righteousness, from the word as milk to the word as solid food. Paul says clearly that milk is for babes and that solid food is for the mature ones (Heb. 5:13-14). Whether we are the babes or the mature ones depends upon what kind of food we take. If you still take milk you are just a babe. Are we still in that stage, not able to take any solid food? We should have left that stage already.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must advance. Learn of the brothers on the gospel team to forsake the shallow gospel and learn to preach the high gospel. When I was giving messages on the river crossers in the Hebrews training I said that today there is a need for a group of people to go out to preach these things recorded in Hebrews as the high gospel (Life-study of Hebrews, pp.154-157). Paul said that he was commissioned to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel to the Gentiles (Eph. 3:8). He did not preach the shallow things concerning heaven and hell. He preached the unsearchable riches of Christ not only as truths to the believers, but as the gospel to the Gentiles.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;LET US GO ON&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Brothers, this is my burden&mdash;let us go on. W. H. Griffith Thomas published a book on Hebrews with the title <em>Let Us Go On,</em>and Andrew Murray published a book on Hebrews entitled <em>The Holy of Holies</em>. My burden is just to fellowship with you and beg you to go on, not just from the outer court to the Holy Place but even from the Holy Place to the Holy of Holies. Let us go on. We need to advance. In our ordinary, regular meetings all these deeper things should be taught, not the shallow things.</p>
<p>Since 1962 some have mostly been remaining for twenty-three years in the same things. Merely to be teaching people the things around the altar, the cross of Christ, is still too shallow. We need to go on to the deeper truths of our very God who is Triune, to get into His foremost and highest attribute, that is, His divine Trinity. His divine Trinity is much higher than His power, His love, or even His life. We need to learn of His Trinity, the Godhead, how the Father is embodied in the Son, how the Son is realized as the Spirit, and how such a Spirit is the realization of the Son and also the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. We need to learn these things not only for our knowledge but also for our enjoyment. &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&rdquo; (2 Cor. 13:14). If you would enjoy this benediction, surely you must know the divine Trinity, the Godhead.</p>
<p>Christians today are shallow because they would not pay the price to labor adequately. These riches are all here in the Bible, just like gold in a mine, but nearly no one would labor to dig them out. Just to buy a few pieces of gold is not our job. Our job is to dig the gold mine. We are to do the mining work. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I hope, brothers, that in your localities you would not repeat the old things. We should learn to go on, to learn the things in the heavenlies, and to learn to speak these higher and deeper things. The book of Revelation, for example, has never been opened up to the Lord&rsquo;s children as it is today. This is now an absolutely transparent book to us. All the points have been covered in the Life-study Messages and the footnotes of the Recovery Version. If you want to know them, you can go to the printed pages and you will get them. This will require your time. To dig out the gold is not that easy. I would encourage all of us to go on in this way. Otherwise, the Lord would not have much of a way to go on; we will delay Him, retain Him, hold Him back. Some of us even repeat the things we taught twenty-three years ago. What we are teaching holds people back. In education if you hold even a problem student in the same grade for a couple of years, he will be spoiled. You even have to encourage the problem student to go to the next grade. We should go further. Let us go on. There is real hope for us to go on in His recovery.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORD OF GOD AND<br />
THE HOME MEETINGS</h1>
<p>In the verses listed on page 37, the Word is revealed in many different aspects. One of the ways to study the Bible is to count the occurrences of certain things, and then to arrange them in a good sequence. First, there is the word of grace. Following this there is the word of truth, based upon John 1:14 and 17. These verses tell us that the Word became flesh, that the Lord came through incarnation, full of grace and truth. How could this grace and truth come to us? Electricity comes into a building by means of a wire. The wire by which grace comes to us is the Word. Actually, the Word is more than a wire; it is the embodiment of grace. The divine grace is embodied in the Word, just as God is embodied in Christ. Outside of Christ you cannot find God. In the same principle, outside of the divine Word it is hard for you to find grace. Grace is embodied in the Word. The truth is also embodied in the Word.</p>
<p>Following this the Bible reveals the word of life (Phil. 2:16; 1 John 1:1). Then there is the word of the gospel (Acts 15:7). The three main constituents of the gospel are grace, truth, and life. When we refer to the word of grace (Acts 20:32), the word of truth (Eph. 1:13), and the word of life, we are speaking of the word of the gospel. Besides this there is the word of the faith (Rom. 10:8). The faith is the very contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament. The New Testament is a will, and a will is a bequest, something given to us as an inheritance. A will always has as its contents the many items contained in it. From God&rsquo;s side it is a will; from our side it is the faith. Besides the word of grace, the word of truth, the word of life, the word of the gospel, and the word of the faith, there are many more aspects of the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING ON THE GROUND OF THE DIVINE WORD</h2>
<p>I have been serving the Lord in the line of His New Testament economy for many years. During this time we have studied and investigated the different practices of Christianity. Especially since the Reformation, many different practices have been raised up, such as the practice of baptism and of the presbytery. When we were young, we were the modern young people of China. During our youth there was a great turn among the conservative Chinese. Our fathers were very conservative, but we were raised up as young people in a new era. We all became quite modern, and we decided to learn the real situation in the world and in history. Almost sixty years ago, I came to know the world situation quite well. All the unequal treaties made by the foreign powers with China were so familiar to us. The leaders of the two main political parties in China today, the nationalist party and the communist party, are my age. We were taught in the same schools as they were. At that time there was a great tide sweeping over all of China to catch the young people. Either one was caught by the nationalist party, or later on he would be caught by the communist party. But we were caught by the &ldquo;Jesus party.&rdquo; I was glad that I was born in that period of time. When I graduated from the English speaking college established by the American Presbyterians, my graduation paper was on imperialism, a subject selected by me. In it I gave a history of the world&rsquo;s inventions and how modern science produces modern industry. Modern industry caused overproduction which forced the western powers to gain the world markets with the help of their &ldquo;gun boats.&rdquo; They went out to invade other countries and forced them to sign treaties for their markets. I gave quite an account of those matters. This is what is called imperialism.</p>
<p>I mention this to you so that you could see that we were not foolish, old fashioned young people. We were not raised up by the Lord in a blind way. We scientifically studied Christianity. We investigated the situation. Since the first year I was saved, I studied the Bible and made a resolution to know the Bible word by word. I read a number of articles by Watchman Nee, and those articles really caught me. I admired his writing and had the highest regard for the truth he presented. I wrote to him and asked him to tell me the best book to help me to understand the Bible. He responded saying that, according to his knowledge, the best book to help me to know the Bible was John Nelson Darby&rsquo;s <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible.</em> Eventually he gave me a set as a gift. I tell you this to give you an indication of where we were and from where we came. We two young people in China, considered as &ldquo;natives&rdquo; by the missionaries, were seeking to know the Bible by means of Darby&rsquo;s synopsis.</p>
<p>We have not only studied the Bible, but we have studied the history of Christianity. We have studied how the different denominations were founded. According to our study, the most vain practice is Pentecostalism. Most of the practices of Pentecostalism are not built upon the divine Word. They build nearly everything upon their feelings and experiences. In our writings we stress experience very much. However, when we speak of or stress experiences, we do so with a strong scriptural base. Perhaps no other writings use quotations from the Scriptures as much as ours do. Almost no one would give a message with as many verses as we have in our Scripture readings. Before you get into the message, you must study all the verses given with it. We stress experiences very much, but we do not do it without a base, without a ground in the Scriptures. We would not take anything that is not grounded on the Scriptures. Without this ground, we would not even care for our very deep, intimate experiences. There must be a ground with the Scriptures. But the practice of Pentecostalism is almost entirely not grounded on the Scriptures. Those who practice Pentecostalism often use the Bible simply to justify their way. Most of those who practice this way are &ldquo;drugged.&rdquo; No logical person would believe some of the things spoken about in this movement. It is so strange that in the twentieth century, in this top scientific country with so much education, people would believe these things. I have studied Pentecostalism for more than fifty years and when I talked to a number of persons who &ldquo;spoke in tongues,&rdquo; they were all convinced that what they were speaking was false. They could not argue with me and admitted that I had the ground in the Scriptures. Yet even though they admitted that what they were practicing was false, they still continued to practice it, insisting that they liked it and that it made them feel happy. This proves that many of those who practice in this way are drugged. We must come back to the divine way. The divine way is to use the Word to the uttermost.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE WAY OF GOD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>The old creation was created by God&rsquo;s word. The universe came into being through the Word of God (John 1:1, 3; Heb. 11:3). God spoke and it was so (Psa. 33:9). With the new creation it is the same. By the word, God created us as the new creation. John 5:24 says, &ldquo;He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.&rdquo; Other verses confirm that the word produced the new creation. First Peter 1:23 says that we were &ldquo;regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.&rdquo; James 1:18 says that &ldquo;He brought us forth by the word of truth.&rdquo; The word regenerates us, and the word enlightens us (Psa. 119:130, 105). You should study to find out how much the word of God does for us.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals many other items of what the Word is. The first item, the basic item, is that the Word is God. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). In Colossians 3:16 the word is personified: &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; Recently I began to realize that personification is implied here, based upon the word &ldquo;dwell.&rdquo; The word dwell here (Gk. <em>enoikeo</em>) is from the root word meaning house (Gk. <em>oikos</em>). We cannot say, &ldquo;Let a table dwell in your home&rdquo; or &ldquo;let the books dwell in your home.&rdquo; We cannot even say, &ldquo;Let a dog dwell in your home.&rdquo; A dog is something living, but it is not a person. In this verse the word of Christ is a personification. In Paul&rsquo;s concept the word of Christ is simply Christ. We must let this Person dwell in us. To take in the word of Christ simply means to take Christ in. To let the word of Christ dwell in you is to let Christ dwell in you. We cannot separate the word of Christ from Christ Himself.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, phrases such as the life of God, the light of God, the love of God, and the word of Christ denote something in apposition. The life of God means that life is God. The love of God means that love is God. The word of Christ means that this word is Christ or that this Christ is the word. The word and Christ are in apposition to each other. Actually, the two are one. This is very meaningful. That Christ and the word are one is confirmed by Revelation 19:13. The One who will defeat the Antichrist and his army is named The Word of God. The Word of God is a Person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING AND PREACHING THE WORD</h2>
<p>Throughout the entire Bible, especially in the New Testament, God sent His chosen people to preach the word. A number of times the New Testament, especially the Acts, simply refers to the word (Acts 4:4; 8:4; 11:19; 17:11; 2 Tim. 4:2). Acts 4:4 says that many heard the word. In Acts 17:11 some received the word. The word is something unique. In the early days, in the Acts, the saints must have used this term, the word, saying, &ldquo;Let us speak the word,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Let us preach the word.&rdquo; Our activity in propagating Christ must be through the word.</p>
<p>If we have much to say, to teach, or to preach from the Word, we are rich. If I am filled with the Spirit, I will not simply practice the so-called gifts or speak in tongues which no one can translate. The New Testament, especially Paul, tells us that when the Spirit is upon the believers, the topmost aspects of the manifestation He gives is the word of wisdom and then the word of knowledge (1 Cor. 12:8). The Spirit will always do this. He will not simply give the gift of healing or speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>The New Testament tells us clearly that all the miraculous things can be done by the enemy (Matt. 24:24; 2 Thes. 2:9). If you trust in these things, when the Antichrist comes with his prophet, you may be deceived. They will do great miracles. The biggest miracle will be that the image, the idol of the Antichrist, will speak (Rev. 13:15). According to the prophecy of the New Testament, many will be attracted (Matt. 24:24; Rev. 13:14). They will all be impressed and believe in the Antichrist because of the signs and wonders.</p>
<p>Recently through an article I learned more concerning Mormonism in the days of Joseph Smith, its founder. In those days the Mormons practiced miracles very much and spoke in tongues. They picked up the thought of Mark 16:17-18&mdash;speaking in new tongues, healing, picking up serpents, and drinking deadly things without being harmed. According to this article Joseph Smith told a learned Methodist pastor that the Mormons had advanced further because they had picked up the miracles, healings, and tongue-speaking. One of the Mormons even encouraged certain Methodists to come with him to see many persons who would heal blindness, deadness, and so many diseases. They practiced according to the works of power of the coming age (Heb. 6:5). The subtle one, Satan, can use all the miraculous things, but he can never use anything that is revealed or conveyed by the divine Word.</p>
<p>I have heard about things such as these many times, and have even seen them. Once someone gets into the miraculous things, he gets addicted. We all must build on the solid rock of the divine Word, not on the sinking sand of the so-called gifts, as taught by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 7:24 through 27. If we behave, work, and live based upon His Word, whatever we are, whatever we do, how we behave, and how we work will be solidly based. We will have the solid rock as our foundation, not sinking sand.</p>
<p>The old creation was created by God&rsquo;s word and the new creation was also created by God&rsquo;s word. We are still under the work of the solid Word. Therefore, we must pick up the solid Word for our preaching. We cannot preach God without His Word. We cannot preach Christ without His Word. We cannot preach the gospel without the word of the gospel. We cannot minister grace and truth and life to others without the word of grace, the word of truth, and the word of life. The Word actually is our preaching. Without the Word how could you preach? It is impossible to preach anything without the Word. But hallelujah, what a big book we have&mdash;the Bible, of sixty-six books. The longest chapter in the entire Bible is Psalm 119. It is composed according to the twenty-two characters of the Hebrew alphabet in the proper order. The one hundred seventy-six verses of that psalm are divided into groups of eight verses. Each group of eight verses forms one section with a heading, a character of the Hebrew alphabet. In those one hundred and seventy-six verses nearly every verse deals with the word of God. Two words are very much used in this psalm&mdash;the word and the testimony. Likewise, the law is mentioned often. In that psalm, the word, the testimony, and the law refer to the same thing. The law is God&rsquo;s testimony, and God&rsquo;s testimony is God&rsquo;s Word. This psalm says, &ldquo;The entrance of thy words giveth light&rdquo; (v. 130). We should spend some time in these verses. That was simply the word of the law, not the word of grace, the word of truth, the word of life, or the word of the gospel. The ancient saints treasured that word to the uttermost. They lived by that word. Today, the New Testament continues the Old to give us many more words.</p>
<p>The Word is God. The word is life. The word is so many things. The word enlightens us; the word regenerates us; the word transfers us out of death into life; the word sanctifies us and does many more things for us. If we do not have the adequate knowledge of the word, if we do not have a deposit of this word, an accumulation of this word, then how could we preach? It would be impossible.</p>
<p>In China there were a good number of saints who were saved through the Pentecostal movement. They were very good brothers and sisters. However, they found out they had no way to go on in that movement, so they turned to the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Whoever had such a Pentecostal background was hard to help. They had a heart to seek the Lord, but their background was too strong. That background replaced the real knowledge and the full realization of the divine life.</p>
<p>It is hard to minister the word of life to those with a Pentecostal background. Unconsciously they may hold on to their background. It is something deeply grounded and rooted in them. It is hard for one to dig it out and clear it away. The only rescue for all of us is the Word of God. I would beg you in love to put the Pentecostal things aside. Come back to the pure Word. Forget about your background and come back to the pure Word of God, regarding yourself as knowing nothing. Then you will be rescued. The word of the Bible, the Bible full of the word, will become a new book to you.</p>
<p>Our problem today is the superficial replacement of Christ with the so-called gifts and the practice of the gifts. Even with this superficial, replacing practice, there is still something real. We cannot deny this. In a very positive sense we are not standing against the gifts. They are in the Bible. Paul in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 still gave ground to these things, but he put the miraculous gifts at the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; of the list of gifts. The top gifts are related to the Word. The first aspect of the manifestation of the Spirit is the word of wisdom, and the second is the word of knowledge (1 Cor. 12:8). The enemy can perform a deceit to imitate the manifestation of the Spirit by means of the miracles, but the enemy can never imitate by means of the word of wisdom and the word knowledge. You cannot receive the word of wisdom in a sudden, miraculous way. In 1 Corinthians 2:7 Paul indicated what the word of wisdom is&mdash;&ldquo;But we speak God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory.&rdquo; Much wisdom is required to understand such a mystery. This is why Paul used this word, mystery, indicating at least three things: first, the mystery of God is Christ (Col. 2:2); second, the mystery of Christ is the church (Eph. 3:4-6); and third, putting these two together, there is the great mystery, Christ and the church (Eph. 5:32). How much wisdom is needed to understand these mysteries! Therefore, Paul charged the deacons in the church to hold the mystery of the faith (1 Tim. 3:9). This can never be imitated.</p>
<p>We must come back to the divine way of using the Word to the uttermost. The Word is God. The Word is personified. Even the coming triumphant Victor will be designated with such a title, The Word of God. We must preach, teach, and speak the word. In the service, in the meetings, in our daily life, and everywhere, we must always speak the word. We can have the assurance that when we speak the word, the word conveys the Spirit. The Spirit always honors the Word.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We must now consider the home meetings, the meetings of the small groups. The traditional way for the Christians to meet is to have a gathering, to gather the members of the church or perhaps some unbelievers. At least one or two learned speakers will speak, while all the rest sit and listen. This is commonly called the service. In a sense we have improved this. At one time, Brother Nee strongly insisted on cancelling the Sunday morning meetings so that the saints could preach the gospel. However, Brother Nee never got through. To tear down any kind of tradition is hard. Some among us may say, &ldquo;Today almost all the nations are accustomed to having a holiday on Sundays. This is the best time to gather the people, either to preach the gospel or to teach the truth. All the people today are accustomed to gathering together to have a service.&rdquo; Some may argue that even the unbelievers like to go to church on Sundays to attend the service, and that we should take advantage of this. In a good sense this is quite logical. Therefore, even until now we still could not annul the Sunday morning meeting. We all have to admit that even today we consider the Sunday morning meeting to be the top meeting. It is &ldquo;the meeting.&rdquo; Recently, due to my study, I became bold, even to revolutionize our practice. But wherever this news went, some may have considered it to be too much. They may have considered that to put away the Sunday morning service is to commit suicide.</p>
<p>In Brother Nee&rsquo;s book, <em>The Normal Christian Church Life,</em> there is a section on the home meetings (pp. 195-200). I was there under that ministry. I listened to those messages, and in a good sense I helped in giving those messages. This had never before been brought forth. Brother Nee tried, but he could not get through. If we were to have divided the total congregation into small groups in the homes, there would just have been an absolute silence in each place. We were too used to the big meetings to go directly into the home gatherings. As a bridge between the big congregations and the home meetings, Brother Nee proposed to have a brothers&rsquo; fellowship meeting and a sisters&rsquo; fellowship meeting. On Saturdays the brothers would come together, and the sisters would come at another time. These meetings were not for teaching or for praying, but for fellowshipping. We began to practice this way. In the first two or three weeks Brother Nee said that the best way to have these fellowship meetings was to give testimonies. We should learn to speak by testifying. We all could have some testimony, testimonies of our repentance, testimonies of our salvation, or testimonies of our daily walk. We all took this word and practiced it. For a few weeks we had testimonies. However, after all these testimonies were exhausted, we came back again silent. This became a hardship to the leading ones. They had to consider what they should do in the meetings, whether to call a hymn or give a prayer. Eventually, the report went to Brother Nee that they were not able to have such meetings.</p>
<p>Later we came to Taiwan. By that time we had learned a lot. I myself had eighteen years of experience. We dropped some of the things we practiced on the mainland which I had learned were not practical. We had a new start in Taiwan which was prevailing. Within six years we increased from about four hundred people to forty thousand, a hundredfold increase. At that time we began our meeting and our work in one hall in Taipei. After one year, we began to meet in a few halls. Then we found out that simply by using the halls, we could not fulfill our purpose. Therefore, we began to have small groups. The church had a number of halls. Under each hall there were a number of small groups. This way worked very well. It was through those small groups that a great number of people were brought in. After being brought in, they were cared for by the small groups. By 1960 the number of saints in Taipei alone was over twenty thousand.</p>
<p>In 1961 I left Taipei and stayed in the United States for four years. For the next twenty years I returned to Taipei only once in a while. Gradually the work in Taiwan with all the churches was in an unnoticeable decline. They did not drop the small group meetings altogether, but without realizing it, there was an unnoticeable decline. By 1984 the church in Taipei had twenty-one halls. However, their membership came down from over twenty thousand to at most eleven or twelve thousand. Among these, about one-third was always present in the meetings. Only about four thousand people were gathered in twenty-one halls. They only practiced the large gatherings. Rarely did they have some small meetings. Very few of the saints paid attention to the small meetings. Their burden was mainly to train twenty-one speakers to take care of the twenty-one halls. In principle, they had gone back to the traditional way of meeting. They cared mainly for the large Sunday morning meetings and neglected the fact that after twenty-three years their numbers had decreased from more than twenty thousand to less than twelve thousand.</p>
<p>Around 1980 I began to notice that the work and the churches there were not going up, but were instead going down. From 1980 to 1984 I had serious talks with the leading ones there, telling them that they should consider their way. Their present way was not working. However, once we get into something, it is hard for us to get out of it. Outsiders may have a clear view, but we ourselves may be veiled by what we practice.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1984 I realized that I had to go back to Taiwan. I could not forget about the work there. I could not go immediately, though, because of the writing of the notes on the New Testament, the outline, and all the annual trainings. In October of that year I finished the last of the notes on the New Testament. Then I said, &ldquo;Now I must go back to Taiwan,&rdquo; and I went. When I went back, I was frank, faithful, and bold with them, because they were mostly people who were raised up through my ministry. I proposed that they have a revolutionizing change. First, the present number of saints was divided into small groups, not more than eight or ten in a group. They formed three hundred ninety-nine groups. Secondly, at that time in that church of nearly twelve thousand, with around four thousand meeting in twenty-one halls, there were only less than six elders. The younger ones were considered to be not qualified. No more than four or five were brought into the eldership. The elders mentioned the brothers by name, saying they were all not qualified. However, I told them that this was the time to change our system and add more elders. To some extent they realized that their system was wrong and that they needed to have a new start. On that same night over fifty elders were established. Each of the twenty-one halls had either one, two, or three elders. Many among them are just a little over thirty years old. I saw their fathers and their mothers before they were saved, and I saw the fruit of those marriages. These young fruit now are elders. This is wonderful.</p>
<p>It is not easy to change our ways. Recently, however, in Taipei during one weekend eleven hundred and four were baptized. This is good news, but I am also waiting to see another positive aspect&mdash;that all the saints speak in the meetings. The eleven hundred and four were brought in not by preaching but by speaking. While I was in Taiwan I told the saints to go out to speak the gospel. This is not a preaching in an official way, but rather a speaking in a regular way in the daily life. I told them to speak the gospel to their friends, colleagues, relatives, neighbors, and everybody. These eleven hundred and four newly baptized believers were brought in by just about ten percent of the church in Taipei. Only a little over three hundred practiced the speaking of the gospel, yet at that time they were baptizing people every day. All of this came about through only one-tenth of the saints. Of course, it would be better if one hundred percent would practice in this way. Now I am waiting to see if all of them would speak in the meetings. The home meetings are the major burden of this elders&rsquo; training.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">MUTUALITY AND SPEAKING<br />
FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h1>
<p>Two of the books in the New Testament which describe the Christian way of meeting are Acts and 1 Corinthians. Acts 2:46 says, &ldquo;And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they took their food with exultation and simplicity of heart.&rdquo; Acts 5:42 says, &ldquo;And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo; Teaching and preaching were practiced by the believers from house to house. First Corinthians 14 describes the Christian way of meeting when &ldquo;the whole church comes together in one place&rdquo; (v. 23). In verse 26 Paul says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOD-INVENTED, GOD-ORDAINED,<br />
AND GOD-CREATED WAY TO MEET</h2>
<p>I recently spent some time to review the New Testament concerning the believers&rsquo; way to meet. In that review, I found out that in the early days the way invented and ordained by the Spirit for the believers to meet is based upon two principles or two factors&mdash;mutuality and speaking. Mutuality and speaking are the basic principles and factors by which or with which we should meet. A church meeting that does not involve mutuality and mutual speaking is wrong.</p>
<p>In Acts as soon as the three thousand were added to the church they began to meet. On the one hand, they met in a public place in the temple. On the other hand, they met in homes. Actually the expression used in Acts is not &ldquo;in homes&rdquo; but &ldquo;from house to house.&rdquo; This indicates that they met in every house. They did not select some homes which were considered good for meetings. They met from house to house without selection.</p>
<p>Meeting in the temple was not the Christian way. The Christian way was to meet from house to house. This practice was altogether new. It was not there in the Jewish religion. In the Jewish religion, their practice was to have big gatherings. Peter, on the day of Pentecost, made use of the temple as a kind of convenience to preach the gospel and to teach the Word. Through that kind of public meeting many were brought into the church. Once they became believers in Christ and were baptized, however, they began to meet in a way initiated, invented, and ordained of the Spirit. By that time, these believers were full of the Spirit, so whatever they did was something of the Spirit. We should consider the way of meeting from house to house as something invented and ordained by the Spirit. In this way of meeting there was mutuality and speaking and even mutuality in speaking.</p>
<p>The one hundred twenty had no way to take care of the houses of those three thousand people. I believe there must have been eight hundred or a thousand houses. How could one hundred and twenty take care of so many small meetings? No doubt, all the newly converted and baptized people met by themselves and they spoke. They had only heard that one message of Peter&rsquo;s. Do you believe that they still spoke about the law on the day of Pentecost after being baptized? I do not think they talked in the way of the Old Testament. They became new persons. They may have referred to the Old Testament, but it must have been that they spoke what they heard Peter speaking on that day. Peter did refer in his speaking to the Old Testament, but he was not speaking the Old Testament. He was speaking the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ. The main subject of Peter&rsquo;s speaking was Christ incarnated, living on this earth, crucified, resurrected, and ascended. Because of what these three thousand people heard, they became believers in Christ. When they met together that evening, they surely spoke the same thing that Peter did, and they continued to speak from house to house, day by day. Again, these new converts became new persons. Even though they had the background of their Jewish religion and of the Jewish way to meet with a large congregation, because they were baptized I believe their concept became new. As a result, they came together in their homes and began to speak what they had heard in the big meetings.</p>
<p>Today in America there is the prevailing background of Christianity which always affects people. Some may get saved through our preaching of the gospel and we may baptize them immediately. If they were to come back in the evening to partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table, they already have the preoccupying thought that there must be a pastor or leading one to speak and that they are just coming to attend a kind of &ldquo;service.&rdquo; This concept kills their function. If we practice in a way where there is no mutuality in speaking, instead of learning to speak, the new ones get fully settled into the way of not speaking. A number of us have been speaking in the recovery and our speaking has really spoiled the function of all the saints, especially the new ones. In a good sense, our speaking helps people, but in another sense, a greater sense, our speaking really annuls the function of so many believers.</p>
<p>There is much speaking in the Pentecostal movement, but what kind of speaking is there? Is it the speaking of the word of wisdom concerning the deep things of God or the speaking of the word of knowledge concerning Christ as the Apostle Paul did (1 Cor. 12:8)? Absolutely not. What we want in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the genuine speaking of the divine Word. This Word is always followed by the Spirit. Genesis 1 first says that God created the heavens and the earth and then the Spirit of God brooded over the death waters (vv. 1-2). Then God spoke a word saying, &ldquo;Let there be light: And there was light&rdquo; (v. 3). In the old creation, God, the Spirit, and the Word all worked together to bring forth creation. In the New Testament it is the same. God, the Spirit, and the Word work together to bring forth the new creation. We need to preach the Word, to speak the Word. When the Word goes out, the Spirit honors, the Spirit follows, and the Spirit works. In our meetings the speaking of the divine Word should be mutual, not individual. Mutuality has to be prevailing, not individuality. We have to &ldquo;kill&rdquo; individuality. The way of individuality is a traditional way, a way of degraded Christianity.</p>
<p>The way to meet in mutuality and in speaking is the way God invented, the way God ordained. This way is God&rsquo;s created way. No one can improve what God has created. Every year the design of cars is improved. But who can improve the way God designed man? Because man is God&rsquo;s creation, no one can improve His design. The same is true of the heavens and the earth. No one can improve them because God created them. This is also true of all the natural principles and natural laws which were created and ordained by God. No one can change them. They could only be put aside or not cared for.</p>
<p>The way of meeting in mutuality and in speaking was ordained by God. No one can improve it. This is the best way to meet, but it has been set aside by degraded Christianity. Now we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must recover this at any cost. We have to annul individuality in our meetings.</p>
<p>We saw this matter more than fifty years ago. Brother Nee encouraged us to practice in this way, but we somewhat neutralized this practice. We did not have one speaker. Instead, we had three or four speakers. The mutuality was only for those three or four. The majority still became &ldquo;jobless.&rdquo; Their functions were all killed by our practice. Now we must fully come back to the God-invented and God-ordained way to meet in order to kill the traditional way. We have to promote this God-ordained way to meet.</p>
<p>This is not merely a matter of changing our meeting schedule. We must learn to get ourselves prepared. We should not think that to meet on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning is wrong. Whether it is wrong or not depends on the way we meet. If we still meet by the old way of practicing individuality in the matter of speaking, that is wrong. We must learn to practice the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting in the way of mutuality in speaking. More people could be saved in this kind of meeting with mutuality and speaking than in the so-called gospel preaching meeting with only one speaker (1 Cor. 14:24). The principle is that we have to shift from the traditional man-made way of meeting to the God-created and God-ordained way of meeting.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to pay the price with some suffering in order to come back to the God-created way of meeting. We should not expect to have a success in this change immediately. I even anticipate some failure. Nevertheless, our failures will lead to success. We have to try this way of meeting again and again until we succeed. In any scientific endeavor, nothing can be accomplished by just one experiment. Experiment after experiment is needed to get the desired results. We have a guide in the New Testament, especially in the book of Acts, concerning the way to meet. We have to believe in this guide. Do not be disappointed that by dropping your old way, you will suffer something. We must change our way at a cost. To remodel a house many things must be torn down. That is a kind of suffering and a sacrifice. If we do not dare to sacrifice something, we cannot do any remodeling. Because we are building, we must expect some failures, yet in this expectation there is much possibility of a success. It all depends upon our endurance. We must endure. We must try again and again. To take the way of the home meetings and the way of mutuality and speaking is a hard burden to put into practice. You should not expect to have an immediate success. You have to expect some failures, but you should not be disappointed. The Lord will help you to get through.</p><h2 class="head1">SPEAKING THE DEEPER THINGS CONCERNING GOD&rsquo;S<br />
NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>You must learn to have the word of God deposited in you. Then you must learn to speak the word of God, not on shallow things, but on deeper things such as the Triune God embodied, realized, and consummated, the seven major steps or processes of the Triune God, and the intensification of the Triune God. Learn to speak these higher things. First, you must learn to speak, and then you must teach others to speak. In your local church meetings you must instruct people to speak. Do not speak to replace them, but speak to instruct them. By your speaking, put them into practice. Let them practice speaking.</p>
<p>Good mothers all know that the way to raise up their children is to take the lead to practice certain things and then to leave time for the children to practice them. The mothers who cook for their families should set an example and then turn the cooking over to their daughters to let them learn. Their daughters may burn some things, but eventually they will learn how to cook. Sometimes the daughters will become much better cooks than the mothers. Perhaps you think you can speak so well, but if you give the younger ones the opportunity to speak, after two years they may speak better than you.</p>
<p>To exercise any control over the saints kills their function. I do not exercise any kind of control. I like to keep the doors open to let everybody have a chance to grow, to advance, and to finish what they begin. This is why, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, there are so many churches on this globe. If we took the way of control there might be only ten or twenty churches in the United States. I do not think we could have spread to other countries. Do not be afraid of others making mistakes. Do not be afraid of trusting others too much. We would rather over trust than control.</p>
<p>We have never been charged by the Lord to control. Brother Nee told us that only the Lord Himself can protect His glory. No human hand can protect the divine glory. Your control in your locality only does one thing&mdash;it limits the Lord&rsquo;s move by killing and annulling others&rsquo; functions. We must come back and practice the Biblical way God ordained, the way God instituted&mdash;the way of mutuality and speaking.</p>
<p>Even when the whole church meets together we must practice mutuality. First Corinthians 14:26 indicates that when the whole church comes together in one place, individuality should not be practiced but mutuality. Paul said that when the church comes together &ldquo;each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:26). Even when the whole church comes together we should practice mutuality in speaking. This is clearly revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. There is not a hint in the New Testament that shows that in the church meeting there should be just one or two persons speaking. The church meeting must be open to all attendants. Paul also tells us in 1 Corinthians 14 that &ldquo;you can all prophesy&rdquo; (v. 31). In this chapter to prophesy is not mainly to predict but to speak forth Christ, to speak for Christ, and to speak Christ.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s way is always to include all. Man&rsquo;s way is to always select. To include all is a hard job, whereas to select is an easy job. Suppose you are taking the lead in a local church of one hundred and twenty saints. To get each one of the hundred and twenty to participate in the speaking, in the mutuality, is a hard job. To work this out you need to spend at least five years to labor day and night, but to go the way of selection is easy. Out of this one hundred and twenty, a certain brother may be quite eloquent, gifted, and knowledgeable. To let him speak and to encourage him to speak is easy. To set up a seminary and train some professional speakers is the easy way. But to promote all the members in your church under your leadership to speak is hard. This requires much labor.</p>
<p>Anything miraculous does not need to be taught. To practice the Biblical way of speaking, though, is not an easy, short-cut way. Even a proper education can never be carried out in one year. We all know that for a person to get highly educated he must spend one year in kindergarten, six years in elementary school, six years in high school, four years in college, another two or three years in graduate school, and another three or four years to earn a Ph.D. There is a Chinese proverb that says to raise up a tree takes ten years, but to raise up a person takes one hundred years. It is not an easy thing to raise up a person and neither can it be done quickly. Even the Lord Jesus was prepared for thirty years before His earthly ministry (Luke 3:23). To become a priest in the Old Testament took thirty years (Num. 4:3, 35, 39, 43, 47). Even to be an apprentice took twenty-five years (Num. 8:24). We should not take the easy way nor the short-cut way.</p>
<p>Open up your mouth to speak, but do not speak nonsense like most of today&rsquo;s so-called speaking in tongues. Learn to speak the word of knowledge first and then go higher to speak the word of wisdom (1 Cor. 12:8). Learn first to speak how Christ as the incarnated Savior is now our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption (1 Cor. 1:30). These are the words of knowledge which we all can learn and speak. After you speak this, you should teach others to speak this. The word of knowledge concerning Christ is in the first stage. From chapter one of 1 Corinthians we should go on to chapter two to speak the deep things of God (v. 10), that is, to speak God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, &ldquo;the wisdom...which God predestined before the ages for our glory&rdquo; (2:7). Practice speaking. Speak about how Christ, after being righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us, is now the life-giving Spirit transforming us. He is working to conform us to His own image as the very firstborn Son of God. You have to tell people that for Christ to be the firstborn Son of God means that He was God, that He became man by putting on human nature, and that He was sonized in His resurrection in His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God. We all are His brethren and we should be the same as He is, possessing humanity with divinity mingled together. Our transformation unto conformation is for glorification. We have to learn to speak the word of wisdom of the deeper things concerning Christ.</p>
<p>Many Christians speak good things. They speak Christ as the Savior. They speak that Christ died for our sins, that Christ is resurrected, and that He is sitting on the throne. These are all good and right things, but they are superficial. Just by speaking these superficial good things, what could the Lord work out? How could the Lord build the church without transformation? Probably you do not even realize how deep the truth taught by Paul in the third chapter of 1 Corinthians is. In chapter one Paul spoke of Christ being our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. In chapter two he told us about the deep things of God. In chapter three he told us that we are God&rsquo;s farm to grow something and that we are God&rsquo;s building. Paul puts the plant life together with building. Humanly speaking, it is impossible for plant life to be for building. Plant life is not for building, but for producing. In the divine thought, however, the producing life is for building. For this there is the need of transformation. Paul told the Corinthians in this chapter that they were God&rsquo;s farm and that he planted, Apollos watered, and God made to grow (3:9, 6). He also said that the church is built with gold, silver, and precious stones (v. 12). This indicates transformation.</p>
<p>I am a little concerned that those of us in the churches cannot speak on transformation. This is why I am very much concerned to see that some among us would promote shallow things. This wastes our time. We are here in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery endeavoring to climb up, but some may be helping people to &ldquo;go down to the basement.&rdquo; We are helping people to advance to &ldquo;college&rdquo; in the ministry, but some may be bringing people back to &ldquo;kindergarten.&rdquo; Your heart may be good and what you do may be right, but the stage of your teaching may be wrong and the direction may also be wrong. For us to have a change from the traditional way to the God-invented, Spirit-ordained way, the way of mutuality in speaking with all the saints speaking the higher and deeper truths, we all have to labor.</p><h2 class="head1">BUILDING THE CHURCH<br />
UPON THE REVELATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>I believe that in the long run the Lord will gain something. It is not only a matter of us gaining something. It must be that the Lord will gain what He desires. He needs a church that matches His standard. The Lord said that He would build His church &ldquo;on this rock&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). Brother Nee pointed out that this rock does not only mean Christ Himself. This rock is the revelation concerning Christ. Peter saw that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God. The church will be built upon such a revelation. To say that Christ is the rock is easy, but to say that the revelation of Christ is the rock requires much study of the revelation.</p>
<p>Every denomination claims that their foundation is Christ, that Christ is the rock upon which they build their denomination. The Catholic church claims the same thing. But do they know anything about the revelation of Christ? The revelation of Christ is altogether developed, explained, and presented from Matthew to Revelation. The entire New Testament is the revelation of Christ. For Christ to build up His church we need to know the entire New Testament as the revelation of Christ. Today there is a shallow gospel with a shallow revelation of Christ telling a person that he is a sinner, that God loves him, and that God gave His Son for him. God&rsquo;s Son came to be the Savior who died on the cross, resurrected, and is now in the heavens. He loves all men. If a person believes in Him, he will be saved and when he dies he will go to heaven. Since he has been saved, he has to be good, improve his character, and glorify God. Christ cannot build the church upon such a shallow revelation of Himself. We have been laboring in the United States for twenty-three years, trying the best to uplift the situation. I really suffer in my spirit to see the saints brought down to something shallow and elementary.</p>
<p>The Lord has released so many truths among us which are mostly in print. I believe that with us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery something has really been sown into our being. I have the full assurance that some day what the Lord has been sowing in these twenty-three years in the United States will come out. If not in this century, then in the next century it will surely come out. What Paul did in his day did not come out at his own time, but eventually we are here enjoying the issue of his labor. Without Paul&rsquo;s labor, what could we say and what could we see? What Paul saw is here not only in the Spirit but also in the Word. Without His fourteen Epistles, what could we know? Without his fourteen Epistles, how could we have the completion of God&rsquo;s divine revelation (Col. 1:25)?</p>
<p>I believe that what the Lord has been doing in these past twenty-three years could never be in vain, but I am still human, hoping to see the result. Sometimes when I see something otherwise, my heart and my spirit surely suffer. If what we have done is something on the sinking sand, it will go away. But what we have built on the revelation of Christ is on the rock. The rock in Matthew 7 is the same as the rock in Matthew 16. At the end of Matthew 7 the Lord says that whatever is done according to His word is built on a rock (vv. 24-25). That rock is the revelation because that rock is the word. The rock is not just the Person of Christ directly, but the revelation of this Person. This is why the churches are also built upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, that is, upon their teaching (Eph. 2:20). Their teaching is the revelation of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUBLISH OR PERISH</h2>
<p>To be a professor in a top university you must publish something. In the top educational circles there is a slogan among the professors&mdash;&ldquo;either publish or perish.&rdquo; To be a professor at a top university requires a great amount of labor. These words apply to the elders&mdash;&ldquo;publish or perish.&rdquo; First you must learn something and then you can &ldquo;publish.&rdquo; Before all the saints can be helped to speak, you have to be able to speak. If you do not take the initiative, who can start something? Our way is not the easy way, or the short-cut way. The God-ordained way is the way of life. You cannot expect a baby born yesterday to be a good speaker after a week. You have to raise him up. This takes at least eighteen years. If the physical life takes time for growth and development, how could we expect the spiritual life to be fully grown overnight? How many among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have had a spiritual graduation? We must change our way at a cost, but to do so the elders must labor. If you do not labor to &ldquo;publish,&rdquo; you will &ldquo;perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have seen that the Christian way of meeting is talked about in Acts and 1 Corinthians. In Acts are the small home meetings. In 1 Corinthians is the meeting of the whole church. In both kinds of meetings, mutuality and speaking must be there. For mutuality and speaking to be the reality in the local churches, there is the need of a great amount of labor on the part of all the leading ones.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW THE BELIEVERS SHOULD MEET</h1>
<p>Strictly speaking, six verses in the New Testament say something about how the believers should meet&mdash;Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor. 14:23 and 26; Hebrews 10:25; and Matthew 18:20. In Acts 20:6-12 there is an account of a meeting in Troas in which the Apostle Paul gave a message, but this passage of Scripture cannot give us a hint concerning how the church should meet locally since the local church meeting is different from a meeting for ministry.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:25 says, &ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.&rdquo; This verse gives us a little window to show us how the saints met in the early days of the church life. They met to exhort one another, and they were to exhort one another even more as they saw the day drawing near. In the saints&rsquo; meetings they did not have a big speaker, but they assembled themselves together to mutually exhort one another. Hebrews 10:25 shows us the mutuality.</p>
<p>All of the six verses we have referred to show that in the early days the believers always met in the way of mutuality in speaking. If you compare such a view with the practice among all the Christians through the centuries, you can see that their practice is really off from what the Bible reveals. They deviated from the proper way to meet because they took the natural way and the easy &ldquo;short-cut&rdquo; way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELATIONSHIPS IN THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>Matthew 18:20, strictly speaking, is the only verse in the Gospels which tells us something about the believers&rsquo; meetings. This verse says, &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.&rdquo; Actually, &ldquo;in My name&rdquo; should read &ldquo;into My name&rdquo; since the Greek word here is <em>eis</em> meaning into. In our translation we should have the boldness to take care of the spiritual significance of the holy Word. Also, the word &ldquo;for&rdquo; in this verse indicates that it is a continuation of the preceding verses.</p>
<p>The heading for Matthew 18 in the outline of the Recovery Version is &ldquo;Relationships in the Kingdom.&rdquo; In the kingdom there are the relationships between the kingdom people, the believers. The entire thirty-five verses of Matthew 18 deals with our relationships with one another in the kingdom. Matthew 18 unveils four major points concerning this topic: 1) to be humble (vv. 1-5); 2) not stumbling anyone (vv. 6-10); 3) recovering the backsliding saints (vv. 12-20); 4) forgiving up to seventy times seven (vv. 21-35). In order for a proper relationship to be maintained between the believers, these four items are absolutely necessary. The believers should exercise to be humble. Only the proud ones would be a stumbling block to others. One who is humble would not stumble others, would take care of the sinning ones, the backsliding saints, and would always forgive others.</p>
<p>Verses 15 through 17 say, &ldquo;Now if your brother sins, go, reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. But if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you as the Gentile and the tax collector.&rdquo; You must try to recover the sinning brother with frankness, with reproof. If he does not hear you, you should take with you one or two more that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. This means that these two or three are not the church, but they are part of the church. They need to tell this matter to the church. If the sinning brother refuses to hear the church, the Word tells us to let him be to us as a Gentile and a tax collector. This does not mean to exclude him, to excommunicate him. The Word says to &ldquo;let him be.&rdquo; Let him be what he is.</p>
<p>In the 1984 elders&rsquo; training I pointed out that I was strongly against the practice of excluding brothers. To drive a backsliding brother out of the church is absolutely wrong. If a brother does not listen to the church, &ldquo;let him be.&rdquo; This matter is up to him. If any believer refuses to hear the church, he will lose the fellowship of the church like the Gentile, the heathen, and the tax collector, the sinners who are outside the fellowship of the church.</p>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall be what has been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall be what has been loosed in heaven.&rdquo; This verse indicates that on the one hand you let the brother be what he is, but on the other hand you have to pray for him. Do not exercise the visible authority, but the spiritual authority. Verses 19 and 20 continue, &ldquo;Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything, whatever they may ask, it shall come to them from My Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst.&rdquo; When verse 19 says &ldquo;if two of you agree on earth concerning anything,&rdquo; this, no doubt, concerns the dealing with such a sinning brother who is not willing to repent. According to the context, the two or three are gathered together into the Lord&rsquo;s name for the purpose of praying for the sinning one. When these two or three are gathered together in such a way, the Lord is there in their midst.</p>
<p>Then Peter proceeded to ask the Lord how often he should forgive his brother when his brother sins against him. Peter thought that perhaps seven times was the maximum amount. Jesus said to him, however, &ldquo;I do not say to you until seven times, but until seventy times seven&rdquo; (v. 22). After this, the Lord gave a long illustration showing how we have to forgive our brothers. It is in such a context that the matter of the believers&rsquo; meeting came out of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16 the Lord spoke about the church and in Matthew 18 He speaks about the church again. The church referred to by the Lord in Matthew 16 refers to the universal aspect of the Body of Christ. The Lord told Peter that He would build His church upon this rock, which means that the universal church, the unique church, would be built upon the proper revelation of Christ which Peter had seen. What Peter had seen as a direct revelation from the Father was the rock, the foundation, upon which the Lord would build His church, His universal Body. To build up the universal church there is the need of the local churches. Matthew 18 affords us a small window to see something concerning the building up of the local churches. In this context the Lord picks up something concerning the local church. If we have some problem, we can go and tell the church. This is surely the local church. To build up the local church, there is the need of the proper relationship toward the other believers. The proper relationship involves humility, no stumbling blocks, and a situation which is full of the recovery of the sinning ones and full of forgiveness to the uttermost. It is only by these four factors that a good relationship can be maintained between the believers for the building up of a local church. I doubt whether there is a church today on this earth which is full of these four items&mdash;humility, no stumbling blocks, full of recovery of the sinning ones, and full of forgiveness.</p>
<p>Even all the leading ones in the churches need to check with themselves as to whether they do not have any pride or still hold on to something that is a stumbling block to others. Do you love all the sinning ones and try your best to recover them? Have you forgiven all those who have offended you from your heart? Charles Spurgeon, who was a master at using illustrations to prove a point, once said that when many Christians forgive others it is like a person burying a dead dog and leaving the tail of the dog standing up out of the earth, visible for all to see. You may be offended by a certain brother and forgive him. Then you would go to two other brothers and say, &ldquo;That brother offended me to the uttermost but I forgave him.&rdquo; In this kind of forgiveness the dog tail can still be seen. Many of us hold &ldquo;the dog tail&rdquo; secretly. For an elder not to be offended is &ldquo;the greatest miracle.&rdquo; To be an elder means that you become a target of others&rsquo; criticism. Many of the brothers love the elders, but at the same time some have &ldquo;a bow and arrow&rdquo; pointed at the elders. Also, all the elders must admit that humanly speaking they all love to see everybody respect them. If we expect others to respect us, we are ready to be offended. Once an elder gets offended, it is hard for him to forget it. Not to forget the offense is to &ldquo;hold the tail&rdquo; of the offense.</p>
<p>From my youth I have been studying the truth concerning the kingdom. Quite often I ask myself, &ldquo;Could I really be there in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens?&rdquo; After reading Matthew 18 once more, I asked myself, &ldquo;Have you forgiven all the ones who have offended you?&rdquo; If you do not forgive your brother, according to the Lord you shall by no means be forgiven in the millennium &ldquo;until you have paid the last quadrans&rdquo; (Matt. 5:26). In other words, you will not be forgiven until you forgive your offending brother from your heart (Matt. 18:35; cf. Luke 6:37). I doubt whether we really forgive every offender from our heart. Generally speaking, you forgive, but you may still be holding on to &ldquo;the dog tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of us need to keep a good relationship with our fellow-believers. In order to do this, you have to humble yourself. Do not think that you are somebody. Rather, you are nobody. We all need to humble ourselves by becoming as little children (Matt. 18:2, 4). Then we have to clear up all the blocks that stumble others. After this, we have to take care of and recover the sinning brothers. Then we have to forgive them even to seventy times seven. In order to maintain this kind of relationship in the kingdom, there is the need of a gathering according to Matthew 18:20, which gives us another small window to see how we believers should meet.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING WITH A SMALL NUMBER</h2>
<p>Basically speaking, we should not meet in big meetings, but with a small number. The smallest number for gathering is two. The Lord refers to two or three meeting together into His name. Without two, you cannot have any gathering. To build up the local church you need to go to the bottom of the required number for meetings. Do not require twenty or two hundred for a meeting. Just require two. Let the saints meet with two or three, with a small number. By the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 18:20 we can realize that in the Lord&rsquo;s intention He did not want to have big gatherings in the local church for practical help. Big gatherings can only be good for general teaching and could never be good to give some practical help. You cannot practically help any brother merely by attending a big meeting with him. It is nearly impossible to render any practical help in a big meeting. You must have a little gathering of two or three to render such help. Sometimes if the number of saints meeting is over ten it would still be hard for you to render the practical help. We need the small number for our meetings so that we can take care of everyone&rsquo;s need practically. I hope that we could all be impressed with this point in the Word of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GATHERED INTO THE NAME</h2>
<p>In Matthew 18:20 the Lord did not say where two or three meet together but where two or three are gathered together. The verb is not in the active voice but in the passive voice. The two or three are gathered. By whom are they gathered? Surely they are not gathered by the elders. They are gathered by the Lord. If we say the two or three meet together, this meeting is initiated by the ones who meet. For two or three to be gathered together, however, indicates that someone is doing the gathering. These two or three are gathered by the unseen Lord because they love the Lord and they are concerned for the Lord&rsquo;s members.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they are gathered together not <em>in</em> the name, but <em>into</em> the name. In order for someone to come into something he must come out of something. To get into something you have to leave something. To be gathered into the name of the Lord means to get yourself out of anything that is besides the Lord Himself. Especially, you need to get out of your self. Too many times when we come together, we come together remaining in our self. If we are gathered by the Lord into His name, we have to get out of ourselves. If you remain in the self, you could never be gathered into the name of the Lord. Into the name of the Lord means into the Lord Himself. The name denotes the Person. Matthew 18:20 does not mean that we are gathered in the name of the Lord but that we are gathered out of self into Him. Therefore, He is in our midst. Suppose we are gathered, not out of ourselves, but still remaining in ourselves. Do you believe that in that condition the Lord is with us? It is when we are gathered out of ourselves and out of all things other than the Lord and into Him that He is among us.</p>
<p>In a locality for the building up of a local church we should meet by small numbers and we should meet by being gathered. We do not initiate the gathering, but He does. We should also meet in a way to be gathered out of our self, out of our home, out of the world, out of our family, out of our business, out of our care for money, and out of so many things. Too many times we meet and still remain in so many things other than Christ. We have to be gathered out of so many things into His name, His Person. It seems as if the Lord was saying, &ldquo;Do not remain in anything other than Me when you are gathered together.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">DESTROYING HIERARCHY<br />
THROUGH THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>By putting Matthew 18:20, Acts 2:46; 5:42, 1 Corinthians 14:23 and 26, and Hebrews 10:25 together, we can see that the main point in these verses is mutuality in speaking. If you have seen this, you can realize how off today&rsquo;s Christians are in the matter of meeting. The reason for the deviation in the way that today&rsquo;s Christians meet is mainly due to hierarchy. Without the building up of hierarchy, there is no need of having big gatherings all the time. We ourselves must admit that we are still under the influence not only of tradition, but also of hierarchy. For a local church to practice having big meetings all the time is the practice of hierarchy. You may say that among us there is no clergy and laity. Actually, however, as long as all the meetings in your locality are big meetings, laity is there and a very secret, hidden clergy is being built up. The only thing that can kill and tear down the clergy-laity system and destroy the foundation of hierarchy is to have the small meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM OF CONTROL AND OF A SEPARATE WORK</h2>
<p>In 1976 when I was sharing on Matthew 23, I spoke strongly against the matter of control. In February of 1984 in the elders&rsquo; training I spoke against the matter of control even more strongly. For some, however, this speaking was disregarded. As long as there is control in a local church, there is the building up of hierarchy.</p>
<p>All the leading ones need to release the church to the saints. In the New Testament there is no such thing as the church of the apostles, the church of the elders, or the church of the evangelists. In the New Testament there are only three designations of the church: the church of God (1 Cor. 1:2), the church of Christ (Rom. 16:16), and the church of the saints (1 Cor. 14:33). The elders, apostles, evangelists, preachers, and Christian workers are not the owners of the church. The owners of the church are God the Father, Christ the Savior, the Redeemer, and the redeemed ones. The elders and the apostles are the slaves. May the Lord open our eyes to see this matter. If you have seen this, you would never agree with any kind of control.</p>
<p>I fully realize that as long as the small groups could be established there would be no control. Who can control the three hundred ninety-nine small groups in Taipei? I made it clear to every group that they did not need to go to the elders to get permission because every believer has the full right to set up a meeting in his home. On the day of Pentecost the three thousand all met in their homes, from house to house (Acts 2:46). Did these three thousand receive permission from Peter to meet in their homes? Did they say, &ldquo;Apostle Peter, may I have a meeting in my home?&rdquo; This would have been ugly. As long as you are a believer, you have the full right to open up a meeting in your home. You even have to be encouraged, charged, and burdened to do this.</p>
<p>Peter did not control the saints, but Peter presented the heavenly vision to them. Let the vision control, let the vision direct, and let the vision govern. The poor situation among us is due to the fact that we may have exercised so much control, yet we never labored on the word to release some vision, some revelation to the saints that they may have the heavenly vision controlling them. My burden is to release the divine revelation to all the saints. All my teachings and all my messages impart a vision to all the churches and this vision controls. This kind of control is not human control, but a heavenly control by the heavenly vision. I encourage all the elders to do this. Turn from controlling the saints to laboring on the Word. Some of the elders are afraid of losing their eldership. They are trembling and fearful to keep their position and to keep the church in their locality under their hand.</p>
<p>The root of the problem today is that with the elders there is the desire to keep a little empire and with the co-workers there is the temptation to do a work in the realm of the Lord&rsquo;s blessed recovery. If the elders had no intention of keeping their empire there would be no problem. The elders would not control, they would not be afraid of losing their position, and they would like to see everybody be better than they are. The recovery is really something unique. If you stay in the recovery, you enjoy the blessing. If you stay outside the recovery, there is nearly no blessing. Some of the co-workers, though, like to stay in the recovery and yet do a separate work. The root of the problem is to do &ldquo;a work in the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entire globe is open to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and we are short of hands. If we had two hundred full-time workers going to South America, this would still not be sufficient. In like manner if we had two hundred full-time workers going to Africa or Europe, this still would not be sufficient. Who can close the door to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? The Lord told the church in Philadelphia that He had the key of David and that He had put before them an open door which no one could shut (Rev. 3:7-8). No one can shut the door to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Who opened the doors in the United States for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? I did not do it and I was not qualified or able to do it. The Lord did it. Who opened the doors in Europe and South America? The Lord Himself. The entire world is open to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I hate to see that we do not have that many proper persons going out to spread the recovery. I expect and hope that many of you will be raised up to be more useful than I was. Many of you can testify that I do not keep any of the Lord&rsquo;s work &ldquo;in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I beg you to forget about controlling others. Let us be the slaves serving the saints. Do not have any intention to do another work within the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, which already has a unique work. If there was not such a work, how could the recovery be here? The recovery has been existing on this earth for sixty years among us and it has been existing in a prevailing way. The Lord began His recovery among us with a small group of young Chinese natives. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been spreading over the entire earth and the ministry of my senior co-worker, Brother Nee, is so prevailing around the globe. I am proud of this. What can compare with that ministry? Who did this? The Lord Jesus did this. The enemy hates this ministry. We must realize that there is only one work for one recovery.</p>
<p>If you consider what I give as a message to be Witness Lee&rsquo;s work, you should stay away and forget about this work and the recovery. If I had considered that whatever Watchman Nee said was his work, his word, I should have stayed away and gone back to North China to do my work. Why do I need to follow a man? Anyone who tries to do another work within the realm of the recovery will suffer a loss. He will waste his time. If you have a heart to carry out what the Lord has shown you as a vision, then do the same work as I did from my beginning. If you realize that this is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and that there is no other way for you to take, yet you want to do another work in the recovery, you will fail. You will damage others, damage yourself, and waste your time.</p>
<p>We must remember that the root of the problems in the recovery are firstly that the elders want to keep an empire and that the co-workers want to do another work utilizing the realm and the blessing of the recovery. Forget about your empire and forget about your own work. Let us come back to take the laboring way, diligently laboring together with the Lord in His work.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BECOMING SKILLFUL IN USING THE WORD<br />
THROUGH THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLES<br />
OF INTERPRETING THE BIBLE</h1>
<p>To accomplish anything, we need the proper weapons. We likewise need the skill and also a strategy. In a war, the first thing you need is the weapons. Then you must also learn the skill of how to use the weapons. Lastly, you need the best strategy. If you have these three things you surely will win the war. In the book of Acts you could see these three things. We must consider what the weapons are in the Acts. Most of us consider that in this book the Spirit is the main emphasis. However, the word, either <em>logos</em> or <em>rhema</em>, is mentioned seventy-eight times in this book, whereas the Spirit, referring to the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, is used less than sixty times. In addition, the Acts does not say that the Spirit grew and multiplied. Instead it says that, &ldquo;the word of God grew and multiplied&rdquo; (6:7; 12:24; 19:20). It would be good to get into all these verses concerning the word in Acts.</p>
<p>The word is very significant. Today, the entire human race is altogether carried on by the spoken and written word. If you took the written word away, what kind of society would there be? Newspapers are everywhere, as are every kind of book, magazine, or other printed media, full of the written word. God also does everything by speaking. He does everything by His word. In Acts, the apostles preached the word and spoke the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN WORK<br />
IN RELATION TO THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>It would be helpful to briefly examine the history of Christian work in relation to the Word of God. In the United States and Canada among the Protestants, the Baptists have the highest membership with over twenty-five million. The Methodists rank second, with close to thirteen million. In their early days, the Methodists used the Bible very much. Of course, in this they followed John Wesley. John Wesley&rsquo;s most prevailing contemporary was George Whitefield, who was more powerful than John Wesley. He did two things&mdash;he prayed and he studied the Bible. He read the Greek text of the New Testament thoroughly on his knees, word by word. Furthermore, he did it by praying. Although he did not have the term pray-reading, he practiced this very much. One account in his writing tells us that on a certain day, after he had been praying on a mountain for quite a long time, he came down and found a large crowd waiting for him. When he began to speak to them, the entire contents of his speaking was nothing but the Bible. In this way his speaking was powerful. This is a fact of history. George Whitefield never spoke in tongues, yet he was powerful. No one can deny history.</p>
<p>Likewise, no one can deny the history of the saints who practiced the inner life. The history of these saints began with the mystics in the 1600&rsquo;s, right after the Reformation. This was a reaction to the Reformation which had become dead. The Lord raised up this reaction within the Catholic Church under the seeking saints such as Father Fenelon, Brother Lawrence, and eventually Madam Guyon. If you read church history, you would realize that they were powerful. We were very much influenced and helped by them. For this reason, we translated their books almost fifty years ago. In them there is no word at all, not even a hint, that they cared for the so-called baptism in the Holy Ghost, yet they were very powerful.</p>
<p>Following this William Law was raised up. History tells us that there were two William Laws, although actually he was one person. The first William Law was a person of dead letters who studied theology. However, at a certain point he received something, which was the real experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, although not in the way practiced by today&rsquo;s Pentecostalism. From that time he became another person, the William Law of the Spirit. He realized that what the mystics experienced was very much needed and a great help to all the Christians. Therefore, he put the mystics&rsquo; writings into a more practical form. That became a great help to the Christians in the past.</p>
<p>After this, Andrew Murray put what William Law wrote into practice. No one can deny that while Andrew Murray was working in South Africa, at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, he was very prevailing. One of his most prevailing books is <em>The Spirit of Christ.</em> I would encourage you to read that book, especially chapter five entitled &ldquo;The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus.&rdquo; His other most prevailing book is his <em>Holy of Holies,</em> an exposition on Hebrews.</p>
<p>Following Andrew Murray, the Lord raised up Jesse Penn-Lewis, who received her help from Andrew Murray. The writings of Mrs. Penn-Lewis were altogether on the subjective death of Christ. Eventually, her writings ushered her readers to the Spirit. Through her writings you may touch the Spirit in a very practical and prevailing way. I hope that you could get a copy of her paper, &ldquo;The Overcomer,&rdquo; in particular the issues published in 1913 and 1914. Her writings were prevailing, and her speaking was likewise prevailing and powerful. Yet, she was strongly and absolutely against the practice of Pentecostalism. Her book, <em>War on the Saints,</em> attacked the practices of Pentecostalism. In Brother Nee&rsquo;s three volume book, <em>The Spiritual Man,</em> the chapter on spiritual warfare draws freely from Mrs. Penn-Lewis&rsquo;s work. Brother Nee said clearly that the three volumes were not purely his writing. When he put out those three volumes he included a long preface, giving a record of the books and pages from which he collected others&rsquo; writings. The greater part of the works from which he drew was from Mrs. Penn-Lewis, especially the portion on spiritual warfare.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penn-Lewis associated herself with the leader of the Welsh revival, Evan Roberts. The revival of Wales (1904-1906) was prevailing to such an extent, that if you had desired to preach the gospel, you could almost have found no one who had not yet been saved there. Evan Roberts, a coal miner and an unlearned man, and his sister were used by the Lord to bring in that revival, the most prevailing revival in this century. In that revival there was no tongue-speaking. Roberts saw much demonic activity at that time, and he learned something concerning spiritual warfare. He passed on all his experiences to Mrs. Penn-Lewis. Mr. and Mrs. Penn-Lewis both became very close friends of Evan Roberts, and Mrs. Penn-Lewis put all his experiences during the Welsh revival into writing. Not only did Evan Roberts become quite prevailing, but also Mrs. Penn-Lewis&rsquo;s writings became very prevailing. However, they both were entirely against Pentecostalism.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penn-Lewis considered the practices of Pentecostalism to be related to the latent power of the soul, related to the demons. Brother Nee translated her material concerning the latent power of the soul into Chinese and added to it. He realized that what those Pentecostalists experienced in the principle of the latent power of the soul corresponded with the practice of some of the ancient Chinese, who by this power were able to contact the demons. One of the elders in Taiwan, before he was saved, was one of the top experts in practicing the latent power of the soul. While remaining in one city, he was able by the power of the soul to visit another city. He also had supernatural visions. He related to us in detail many of his experiences.</p>
<p>T. Austin-Sparks was a young co-worker of Jesse Penn-Lewis. As a young man, he was a modernistic pastor. He heard Mrs. Penn-Lewis&rsquo;s preaching and was saved. After his conversion, he became a learner under Mrs. Penn-Lewis. Even up until now, in the past two centuries, no writings on the inner life have ever reached such a high level as those of Austin-Sparks. Although I am honest to say this, I was entirely not in agreement with him concerning the church life. We had over thirty long talks together. He came to visit us in Taiwan twice and I returned the visit by staying with him four weeks. He brought me to his retreat in Scotland, where we stayed together for one week, having private talks every day concerning one thing&mdash;the practice of the church life. Although we could not agree, I do admit that his writing on the inner life was excellent. However, my point is that this brother was altogether against Pentecostalism.</p>
<p>In 1955 we invited Brother Sparks to come to us in Taiwan. Many of the saints became excited, for they expected to receive great help for the inner life from him. Some of these excited ones held their own meetings, apart from the church meetings. On one afternoon in the third hall, a brother who was a professor received &ldquo;the baptism of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; He became crazy with this experience. Although he did not speak in tongues, he began to speak by walking around the hall, speaking continually for three hours. All the attendants became excited. This exercised quite an influence upon others. A small number among us who spoke in tongues also became excited over this. That was their opportunity to be released. However, when Austin-Sparks arrived and came to know of this, he charged those saints to stop that activity. He was very strong. That shocked the excited ones, who then ceased their activity. Later they all admired the messages he gave.</p>
<p>I am trying to be fair and I am trying to help you to be fair. The church has a long history of twenty centuries. It was only in the last part of its history, since the middle of the last century, that Pentecostalism was raised up. In the period of eighteen and a half centuries before that time, the church already had a long history. Even in these last one and a half centuries many wonderful things have happened in the church besides Pentecostalism. I cannot go along with Pentecostalism because those who practice this make the Pentecostal things everything. How could the Pentecostals annul everything else and make Pentecostalism to be &ldquo;the thing?&rdquo; They claim that tongue-speaking is the unique sign of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Who can go along with this? Many throughout history have experienced the Lord and become prevailing apart from the Pentecostal things. I myself was saved in February of 1925. I was fully converted and changed. I gave up the world and have never gone back for sixty years. Likewise, the mystics, such as William Law, Andrew Murray, Mrs. Penn-Lewis, and T. Austin-Sparks experienced the Lord and became the top among the inner life people. Many of the Brethren teachers such as John Nelson Darby, C. H. Mackintosh, and William Kelley, produced writings not only full of knowledge, but full of power and full of life. No one can deny this. Just one hundred thirty years ago, around 1850, the Brethren movement became so prevailing throughout Europe and reached even to Central America. D. M. Panton said that the Brethren movement was much stronger than the Reformation. The only difference was that the Reformation widely propagated itself, while the Brethren movement sought to conceal itself. They became so powerful by speaking and teaching the Word. They swept through all of England. We cannot deny the facts.</p>
<p>At this time also there were great Bible expositors such as G. Campbell Morgan, A. J. Gordon, and S. D. Gordon. When G. Campbell Morgan held a Bible study meeting in London, the hall was crowded night after night. That was really powerful. In those meetings there was no speaking in tongues, even though speaking in tongues had already begun in England. Charles Spurgeon, the great evangelist in England, Charles Finney, D. L. Moody, and Jonathan Edwards in America are among the other giants in church history who never practiced the Pentecostal things.</p>
<p>If you studied history, you would find out that they were powerful. They all were powerful in the Word. D. L. Moody said that if his entire library were to be burned and his Bible and C. H. Mackintosh&rsquo;s Notes on the Pentateuch were to remain, that would be sufficient. D. L. Moody&rsquo;s messages were mostly based on the Brethren teaching. Dr. C. I. Scofield brought the Brethren teachings into American theology. He put out his Scofield Reference Bible based upon the Brethren teachings that nearly dominated American fundamental Christianity for some years. The Moody Bible Institute still carries Dr. Scofield&rsquo;s Bible correspondence course. There has been a strong history in the church concerning the Word. Whoever is skillful in using the Word of God is powerful, and their work remains because it is built up with the solid Word.</p><h2 class="head1">DEVELOPING THE SKILL TO BECOME<br />
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>A third big Protestant denomination today is the Church of Christ. Today it is bigger than either the Presbyterian or the Episcopalian denominations. Thirty years ago an American missionary of the Church of Christ who went to Taiwan told me that there were about one million in that denomination. Within thirty years their numbers have at least tripled. The Church of Christ&rsquo;s teachings concerning the church are very similar to ours. However, we cannot go along with their teaching of baptismal regeneration. Although this is a matter merely of doctrinal debate, their insistence on receiving only those who are baptized by them is serious and very sectarian. However, they have become powerful and are very dogmatic in their teaching. The members of the Church of Christ are trained with their teachings. They surely know their points of doctrine and their teachings are very logical. Therefore, those teachings have caught the higher class people because logical people like to know doctrines. Only doctrines can convince logical people. The Pentecostals who go to the campus today get little fruit. No scientific student of today would listen to these Pentecostal things. However, if you go there with the higher gospel, you will catch many.</p>
<p>The Church of Christ members were trained by their church to be their representatives. Once as I was speaking in Texas on the Spirit a woman from the Church of Christ stood up to question me concerning water baptism and to educate me with her Church of Christ doctrine. It is a shame that we have been here for twenty-three years and have given so many messages, but there are so few representatives of the church. Even the elders may have difficulty in speaking concerning the divine Trinity, a major point of the truth. Some of you have received all the messages and have attended the trainings. However, the trainings may have been like a cloud through which you passed for ten days, receiving little of a permanent deposit. Afterwards you may have bought the messages, but perhaps you have never read them. They may simply be on your shelves. How many of the elders could give a message on the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man from Romans 8? Could you debate with others concerning this? We have many treasures but few salesmen. On the campuses the Church of Christ is prevailing, not in holding meetings, but in catching four or five and forming a small group to study the Bible.</p>
<p>We must have a change. Our weapons are the best, but our skill is not up to the standard of our weapons. Likewise, we do not have the proper strategy. We have to change our strategy to fight the battle, and learn the top skills to use our top weapons. If you dear saints would be faithful to the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move by developing the skill to use the top weapons, the Word revealed to us, and by taking the top strategy, within a quarter century we will gain all of America. Not only will you go out to speak, but you will produce many speakers. I hope that the gospel team would produce many new teachers. Those who are converted will be the same as you are after two years. They will speak the high word, the high gospel, the high truth. This will be warmly welcomed by the highly educated people. The truths taught by you will remain solidly as a rock for the seeking Christians to work on, to live on, and to stand upon.</p>
<p>In the Acts the Spirit was working, but the Spirit worked only through the word. The word is the wire of the divine electricity, and the Spirit is the electricity. Actually, the word is the Spirit. The disciples preached the word, they spoke the word, they did everything with the word and eventually Acts says that the word grew and multiplied. I hope that after twenty years all the deep truths which are covered in our printed pages will grow and multiply. This is why I feel very sorrowful that some of you would pick up something else besides the rich word to bring into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery as a part of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is a real distraction and a frustration.</p>
<p>I would beg all the leading ones to get themselves into these deeper truths. By this you will become teachers and will be able to teach every saint in your locality to speak the same thing. Forget about being a leader. Forget about maintaining a little empire for your leadership. Do not do this. Just do one thing&mdash;get yourselves into the deeper truths. Then you must teach, in the big meetings and in the small meetings. Help all the saints to experience the same thing. This is what the Lord is depending upon today. Without this, the Lord could not have the victory. Be fully assured that if we would do this, the Holy Spirit would surely agree. He would honor this. If you would like to receive more of the Spirit, do this. You do not need to fast, to pray for the baptism of the Spirit, or to speak in tongues. Forget about these things. Simply go out to speak the high word from the Bible, and the Spirit will honor your speaking. Eventually the word spoken by you will become the Spirit. You will get the Spirit and others will get Him too. I know what I am speaking about. This is the real power.</p><h2 class="head1">GOVERNING PRINCIPLES<br />
OF INTERPRETING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>For quite a long time I have been considering how to use the Life-studies. The Life-studies were written to convey the life supply and to release some basic truths. Also, they were put out to help the young saints to know the Bible. Many verses are covered with many points. Eventually the Life-studies become a mine with many treasures. Therefore, it is hard for people to use the Life-studies. They do not know what to choose. If you would take care of every message with every paragraph and line, it would take you much time. It is likewise hard to use the messages in the meetings. Eventually, I believe that the Lord has given us the best way, that is, to pick up the crucial points of the truth (see Book 6, chapter one).</p>
<p>In this chapter, I have a burden to share with you the principles of studying and understanding the Bible. The Bible has been in man&rsquo;s hands for at least eighteen or nineteen centuries. There have been many expositors and teachers who defined and taught the Bible. By reading many of their writings from many sources we were helped very much to be balanced. The best way to understand the Bible is to pick up the Brethren theology. Today there are at least four different theologies&mdash;secular theology, reformed theology, fundamental theology, and Brethren theology. Among these, the Brethren theology is the best. In this country the two top seminaries are Dallas Theological Seminary and the Moody Bible Institute. These two use the top theology, being based mostly upon Brethren theology. When Dr. Scofield was working in Dallas, he was very close to Dallas Theological Seminary, and his writings nearly dominate the theology of Dallas Seminary. Scofield&rsquo;s reference Bible was mainly based upon Brethren theology. Likewise, D. L. Moody was absolutely in the line of the Brethren teachings.</p>
<p>The first good point of Brethren theology is that it opens up the entire Bible in a general way. In his <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</em>, Darby opened up the Bible not only in a general way but with so many basic principles. For example, in the Psalms he points out some principles, from which I received great help in studying the Psalms.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Brethren opened up the types. Typology was a favorite of the Brethren teachers. I also received much help from them in this matter. In our Life-study of Exodus, the speaking concerning the types is mostly based upon the Brethren teaching, of course, with much more development on my part. Thirdly, they opened up the prophecies. It was they who pointed out that to understand the prophecies in the Bible you must take care of two things, the great image in Daniel 2, which governs the Gentile world from Babylon up to the ten kingdoms under the upcoming Antichrist, and the seventy weeks in Daniel 9. These two items are the governing, basic principles in understanding and explaining the prophecies. G. H. Pember, Robert Govett, and D. M. Panton all followed this principle. Fourthly, they opened up the Bible in dispensations. It was they who began to see God&rsquo;s economy, although they did not use this word. They taught that there are seven dispensations, although they preferred to say that there are four&mdash;the dispensation of the patriarchs, that is, the dispensation before the law and the dispensation after the law (Rom. 5:14), the dispensation of grace (Rom. 5:15), and the dispensation of the coming kingdom. Reformed theology denies the matter of the dispensations, but the Brethren teaching stresses this quite much.</p>
<p>The Brethren also opened up the matter of the divine Trinity. They taught very much concerning the Trinity and Christ&rsquo;s Person. No theology teaches so much concerning the Trinity and Christology as Brethren theology. Lastly, the Brethren opened up much of the truth concerning the church. Nearly all the other theologies do not touch the church. Only the Brethren touch the church to such a great degree. These are the six main items of Brethren theology, and we have been very much influenced by them. We honor and regard Brethren theology as the top theology. If one would read our messages with the proper understanding, he would realize that our teaching is based upon and constituted with the Brethren theology.</p>
<p>However, to only have a proper knowledge of Brethren theology would leave us imbalanced. Therefore, we also need the inner life teachings starting from the mystics through William Law, Andrew Murray, Mrs. Penn-Lewis, T. Austin-Sparks, and so many others, including some of the top speakers of the Keswick Convention. You must have an adequate knowledge of these two kinds of teachings, the Brethren teachings and the inner life teachings. If you do not have this, you are not qualified to know the Bible properly. The problem with the Brethren is that they were short of the inner life. On the other hand, Andrew Murray, a top inner life teacher, was short of the Brethren theology. His writings are correct in the experiences, but often quite wrong in the usage of Bible verses. We have learned these things, and this has become a balance and a warning to us.</p>
<p>Today in the northern United States, reformed theology is very prevailing. Reformed theology is renowned for their stance on God&rsquo;s eternal selection and predestination. It is Calvinism that affirms that if you are saved, you are saved forever, because God has selected and predestinated you for eternal salvation. However, Calvinism neglected man&rsquo;s responsibility. Because of this Arminianism sprang up in opposition, stating that even though you have been saved, you may still perish. They are strong on the side of man&rsquo;s responsibility, but they use the verses wrongly. All the verses they quote to show that a man can perish after being saved do not refer to eternal perdition, but to the dispensational punishment of the kingdom. This matter of the kingdom has never been seen, either by the Calvinists or by the Arminians. This was seen, however, by Mr. Govett and Mr. Panton, who helped to develop the proper teachings. G. H. Lang, a Brethren teacher, also took the same line.</p>
<p>Now there is the line of Calvinism, the line of Arminianism, and the line of the kingdom. We take the latter line, for without this there is no reconciliation between God&rsquo;s selection and man&rsquo;s responsibility. It is absolutely right that God has chosen us and even predestinated us for eternal salvation. After we have been saved, however, we need to bear an amount of responsibility by His sufficient grace and by our cooperation with Him through the enjoyment of His grace. If not, we will become a failure. To become a failure does not mean that we will perish. However, we have been strongly warned, mostly by the word of the Lord Jesus and by Paul&rsquo;s teaching as well, that there will be an age, the kingdom age, which will be a reward to the faithful ones and a punishment to the unfaithful ones. This matter of punishment is presented especially in Hebrews. In Hebrews there are five warnings, each related to the dispensational punishment of the kingdom (2:1-4; 3:7&mdash;4:13; 5:11&mdash;6:20; 10:19-39; 12:1-29). The Arminians wrongly apply these warnings to eternal perdition. The two extreme schools of Calvinism and Arminianism can never be reconciled. However, when we consider the dispensational punishment of the kingdom, everything becomes clear; the pieces of the puzzle come together to give us a clear view of the entire situation.</p>
<p>You must learn Brethren theology, you must learn the inner life teachings, and you must know where Calvinism and Reformed theology stand. Likewise, you must know where the school of Arminianism stands. Between Calvinism and Arminianism there is the kingdom teaching concerning the reward to the faithful ones and the punishment or discipline for the unfaithful ones. After you pick up these five things, you will become qualified and very much equipped to understand the Bible. I assure you that you could never go astray. This vision will govern your interpretation of every verse of the Bible. All the notes I wrote on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament were written under the governing of these five things. Although my teachings could be wrong in some small points, they are quite safe.</p>
<p>Over fifty years ago when I was in Shanghai, I saw a paper put out by the Seventh Day Adventists in which they said that the United States would be one of the ten kingdoms under the Antichrist. Their interpretation was wild, without restriction, because they had no vision. However, if you have these five things as the governing principles for your interpretation of the Bible, you will be safe. I would pass this on to you, especially to the young ones. Pick up the principles to learn how to interpret the Bible and study typology and prophecy.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE AGE OF THE OLD CREATION,<br />
THE AGE OF THE NEW CREATION,<br />
AND THE AGE OF RESTORATION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE BIBLE ACCORDING TO DISPENSATIONS</h2>
<p>We have already seen that in order to expound the Bible in a proper, adequate, and high way we need a knowledge of the theology of the Brethren. The top point of Brethren theology is that they opened up the Bible in the matter of dispensations. Reformed theology rejects the thought of dispensations and believes that the Old Testament is the same as the New Testament. In this theology there is no difference between the age of the law and the age of grace. The Brethren were the first ones to begin to know the Bible not only according to its spiritual principles, but also according to dispensations. The problem that the Galatians had was that they did not have a clear vision of the change in dispensation. The Judaizers spoiled the distinction between the law and faith. Under the law what was needed was works, but under faith only believing is needed. To understand the book of Galatians, you must have the clear concept of God&rsquo;s dispensations. God deals with His chosen people in different ages in different ways. Under the law God dealt with His people according to the law. In the age of grace, God deals with His people according to grace by faith.</p>
<p>Paul wrote Hebrews 6:4-5 according to God&rsquo;s dispensations: &ldquo;For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those who were once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age.&rdquo; We all have been enlightened, having received the heavenly light. We have also received the heavenly gift of the divine life, and the Holy Spirit, so we are the partakers of the Holy Spirit. In verse 4 we have tasted of the heavenly gift and in verse 5 we have tasted of the good word of God and the works of power of the coming age. These are three kinds of tastes. The enlightenment, the heavenly gift, the Holy Spirit, and the good word of God belong to the present age, the age of grace. The works of power belong to the coming age, the age of the kingdom. In the New Testament, miracles and works of power are synonyms. The previous age was the age of law, this present age is the age of grace, and the age to come is the age of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPARTING OF THE DIVINE LIFE<br />
IN CONTRAST TO MIRACLES</h2>
<p>In the age of the law there was no regeneration and in the coming age there will be no regeneration either. Regeneration is only in the age of grace. Regeneration is to be born again with another life, the higher life, the divine life, to be a new creation. To regenerate the fallen and dead people with the divine life to make them a new creation was not present in the age of the law and will no longer be there in the coming age of the kingdom. Regeneration is absolutely a unique thing in this age of grace. Such a unique thing does not have any relationship to miracles. Miracles are not related to our spirit, but to our bodies; however, regeneration is absolutely related to our spirit (John 3:6). Romans 8:11 tells us that the divine life can even be given to our mortal body. This is not a miracle, but a matter of the imparting of the divine life. For the Lord to give life to our mortal body is for Him to impart the divine life into our natural body. That imparting of the divine life has nothing to do with miracles and is absolutely a spiritual matter of life. When the Lord comes back our body will be transfigured. This is not a miracle but the saturation of our body with the divine life for God&rsquo;s expression and our glorification.</p>
<p>God does two kinds of work: one kind belongs to the spirit with the divine life, and another kind, which are the works not of life but of power, are miracles. Works of power are related to our physical body and not to our spirit. When the Lord raised Lazarus from the dead, that was not something related to his spirit but to his body. We know that his being raised from the dead had nothing to do with his spirit because he died again. During the Lord Jesus&rsquo; earthly ministry many were healed or raised from the dead, but they all eventually died. This is strong proof that miracles do not have any relationship to our spirit.</p>
<p>We must realize that there were miracles in the age of the law. Elisha performed many miracles, among which were the raising of the Shunammite&rsquo;s dead son (2 Kings 4:32-37) and the healing of Naaman the leper (2 Kings 5:9-14). Although healings were there in the Old Testament, there was no regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORKS OF POWER OF THE COMING AGE</h2>
<p>Some of the works of power of the coming age are described in the book of Isaiah. The coming age will be full of works of power. Isaiah 11:6-9 says, &ldquo;The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice&rsquo; den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.&rdquo; In the coming age the wolf will dwell with the lamb and a little child will lead wild animals. These miraculous things will be present in the coming kingdom age.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the coming age, Isaiah 35:5-10 says, &ldquo;Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes. And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein. No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there: and the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.&rdquo; These verses are a further description of the blessings in the kingdom age. Then Isaiah 65:25 says, &ldquo;The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent&rsquo;s meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.&rdquo; The three aforementioned portions from Isaiah are a picture of the coming age. The coming age will be an age full of miracles, not only in healing but also in restoration.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE AGES</h2>
<p>Between eternity past and eternity future there are basically three ages: the age of the old creation, the age of the new creation, and the age of restoration. From God&rsquo;s creation of the heavens and the earth in Genesis 1:1 to the beginning of the age of grace is the time span of the age of the old creation. The age of grace is the age of the new creation. Most of the promises in the Old Testament are related to the age of the new creation, the age of grace. A small portion of the promises in the Old Testament are related to the coming age such as the ones from Isaiah. In the age of the old creation God created mankind and the entire universe, and when what he created became fallen he came in to heal, to restore. To restore the fallen creation is to recover and maintain it. God firstly created and then God restored. We can see from Genesis to Malachi how God healed, recovered, and maintained His fallen creation. Part of this maintenance was the keeping of His chosen people under the custody of the law.</p>
<p>In the age of grace, God is doing neither a work of creation nor a work of restoration. The age of grace is the age of the new creation. The old creation is merely the creation without God in it. The new creation is the old creation born of God with God as its new element. The old creation, because of the addition of God to it, becomes the new creation. The old creation does not have the divine nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does (John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Peter 1:4). Hence, they are a new creation (Gal. 6:15), not according to the old nature of the flesh, but according to the new nature of the divine life. The work of God in the age of grace is to produce the new creation. In the coming age, in the millennium, God will neither create nor produce the new creation, but he will do a work of restoring the old, fallen creation. This restoration work does not include us because by that time we will have become the new creation already.</p>
<p>Matthew 19:28 describes the age of restoration, the coming kingdom age (Acts 3:21), after the Lord&rsquo;s second coming&mdash; &ldquo;And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&rdquo; The Greek word for regeneration in this verse is also used in Titus 3:5. This Greek word is different from the word for born again (1 Peter 1:23). In Matthew 19:28 this word is used for the restoration of the millennium. In Titus 3:5 it refers to a change from one state of things to another. The second birth which the Lord speaks about in John 3 is something of the divine life, the inner life. But regeneration in Matthew 19:28 does not denote anything related to the inner life but rather something related to a change of condition, a restoration.</p>
<p>Acts 3:21 also refers to the times of restoration in the millennium, as prophesied in Isaiah 11:1-10 and 65:18-25, referred to by Christ in Matthew 17:11 and 19:28. Acts 3:21 tells us that heaven must receive the Lord Jesus &ldquo;until the times of restoration of all things.&rdquo; The coming age will be an age of restoration. Restoration is not to regenerate with the divine life but to restore the fallen things. According to the Bible, the three ages related to God&rsquo;s work of creation are the age of the old creation, the age of the new creation, and the age of restoration. The entire creation became fallen. Out of this fallen creation God chose some out of mankind to be regenerated with His life and even with Himself to make them a new creation. Second Corinthians 5:17 tells us that if anyone is in Christ he is a new creation.</p>
<p>When the Lord comes back, the age of the new creation will be over. By that time many of the descendants of Adam will have died already; some will still be living on the earth and the Lord will judge them. Second Timothy 4:1 tells us that the Lord Jesus is the Judge of the living and the dead. As the righteous Judge (2 Tim. 4:8), He will judge the living on His throne of glory at His second appearing (Matt. 25:31-46), and He will judge the dead on the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15). His judgment of the living at His coming back is fully revealed in Matthew 25. He will gather all the living nations to Himself and He will divide them into sheep and goats. The goats will go to the lake of fire and the sheep will be transferred into the millennium on the earth to be the nations. These sheep have never been and they will never be regenerated. Revelation 20:8-9 tells us that at the end of the millennium some of the nations will be instigated by Satan to rebel against God. After the Lord&rsquo;s judgment on these rebellious ones, the remnant of the nations will be in the new heaven and the new earth to be the nations outside the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21 there are two categories of people&mdash;the peoples of God on the new earth (vv. 3-4) and the sons of God in eternity (vv. 5-7). The sons of God are regenerated to be the new creation. The peoples of God are not regenerated but restored to their created condition which was lost due to the fall of Adam. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, the heaven, the earth, and all created things were reconciled, redeemed back to God (Col. 1:20). Redemption is not a matter of the divine life. To be redeemed is not to be regenerated. For the heavens and the earth to be redeemed does not mean that they were regenerated. Christ&rsquo;s redemption is not only for us, the regenerated people, but also for all the things in the heavens and the earth. The sheep in the millennial kingdom and the peoples of God outside the New Jerusalem will be the restored ones and the redeemed ones, but they have never been and will never be regenerated.</p>
<p>In the new heaven and the new earth, the tree of life has two functions. One function is to produce the fruit to feed the believers and the other function is to produce leaves for the healing of the nations. Healing is something miraculous. The miraculous healing through the leaves of the tree of life is related to the physical body of the nations. The fruit of the tree of life which feeds the believers is related to the divine life within them.</p>
<p>Let us now summarize in a brief way what we have fellowshipped concerning God&rsquo;s work in all the dispensations. God created the universe and His creation became fallen. Then God came in to regenerate His chosen people, who were part of the old creation, to make them a new creation. At the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, He will judge the living. Some of these living ones will be the peoples on the new earth at the time of the millennium. At the end of the millennium some of these peoples will rebel and God will judge them. The remnant of these living ones will be transferred into the new earth and will be the nations, the peoples of God around the New Jerusalem. These peoples will have been restored and even redeemed, but they will never have been regenerated. In the new heaven and the new earth, God will have a new creation plus a restored part of the old creation. At the consummation of God&rsquo;s work in the new heaven and the new earth is God&rsquo;s new creation with Himself in this new creation as its life and its everything. This new creation is actually the New Jerusalem, which is a mingling of the Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people. In eternity future there will also be the restored old creation. We must realize that the new heaven and the new earth will not be another heaven and another earth. The new heaven and the new earth will be the old heaven and the old earth restored but not regenerated. The new heaven and the new earth and all the nations are the restored old creation. In the center of the restored old creation is the new creation, the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORKS OF POWER NOT BELONGING<br />
TO GOD&rsquo;S NEW CREATION</h2>
<p>In the age of God&rsquo;s old creation, God did some creating work and also some restoring work. This restoring work is the performing of miracles. The miracles, the works of power, do not belong to God&rsquo;s new creation but to the restoration of God&rsquo;s old creation. In the New Testament times there were also healings such as the resurrection of people who died. In the age of the kingdom all people will be healed miraculously. We must be clear, though, that no miracle belongs to God&rsquo;s new creation. To say that miracles are the work for the new creation is absolutely wrong. If this is right, there would be no martyrdom of the saints. Both Peter and Paul were among the many martyrs throughout the history of the church. If Peter had had the concept that miracles were something for the new creation he might have told the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, you have used me to raise up the dead. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you rescue me from the hands of the persecutors? You once released me from prison. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you do it again? Why wouldn&rsquo;t you keep me on this earth until your second return?&rdquo; Peter, of course, did not have such a concept. In fact, Peter, like Paul (2 Tim. 4:6), knew that he would leave the world by martyrdom, and he was ready for it (2 Peter 1:14). All the people who were physically healed eventually died. All the miracle performers, even the greatest ones like Peter and Paul, were martyred, killed. The Lord would not perform miraculous things for His chosen people all the time. However, during the age of the new creation, the age of grace, for certain purposes the Lord borrowed the works of power, the miracles, from another age.</p>
<p>The New Testament believers have been enlightened, have tasted of the heavenly gift, have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, have tasted the good word of God, and have also tasted the works of power of the coming age. The first four items are fully destined for us in this age, but the last item, the works of power of the coming age are not destined for us in this age of grace. One reason why I know that the works of power of the coming age are not destined for us is because of Paul&rsquo;s experience with a thorn in his flesh recorded in 2 Corinthians. Paul asked the Lord three times to remove this thorn, but the Lord&rsquo;s reply was, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:9). The works of power to take away the thorn from your body is a kind of healing. This healing does not belong to the new creation but to the restoration. Whether the Lord heals and restores your body, which is part of the old creation, is up to Him. He may do it and, then again, He may not do it.</p>
<p>Wonders and signs are not part of God&rsquo;s central testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, neither are they part of His full salvation; the Lord borrowed the miraculous things from the coming age to show that what the apostles preached and ministered and how they acted were absolutely of God, not of man (Acts 2:43; Heb. 2:3-4). God would not perform the miraculous things all the time in the age of grace. Even if the thorn in Paul&rsquo;s flesh were taken away, Paul would still die. God did not desire to take away Paul&rsquo;s thorn in this age of grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S EARTHLY MINISTRY</h2>
<p>In the three and a half years of our Lord&rsquo;s earthly ministry He did two categories of work. First, He ministered His life to God&rsquo;s chosen people which was His main work (John 10:10b). He died on the cross so that He could release the divine life (John 12:24) and He resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) that He could impart the divine life through His death into God&rsquo;s chosen people. Second, He performed some auxiliary miracles. When the Lord performed miracles, though, these were not the real goal of His ministry. John 2:23-25 says, &ldquo;Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, when they saw the signs which He did. But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men, and because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.&rdquo; Many saw the signs which Jesus did and believed in Him, but Jesus would not entrust Himself to them. John 3:1 continues by saying, &ldquo;But there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;but&rdquo; at the beginning of 3:1 indicates that this case of Nicodemus differs from the cases in the foregoing verses 2:23-25. All the cases there are cases of people believing in the Lord because of seeing the miracles He did. The Lord could not commit Himself to such people. But this case in chapter three is one of life and regeneration. This reveals that the book of John is not for miraculous things, but for life. This is why even the miracles done by the Lord are called signs in this book, signifying that the Lord came for life, not for miracles.</p>
<p>The Lord would not commit Himself to those who believed in Him by seeing the signs which He did, but another man came. This man came, not for signs or miracles, but he came seeking knowledge. Nicodemus may have thought he needed some better teachings to improve himself, but the Lord&rsquo;s answer unveiled to him that his need was to be born again. To be born again is to be regenerated with the divine life, other than the human life received by natural birth. Hence, Nicodemus&rsquo; real need was not some better teachings to improve himself, but the divine life to remake him. The Lord presented Himself to Nicodemus not as a miracle performer nor as a rabbi to teach him. He unveiled to Nicodemus that He was the brass serpent to die for him (3:14-16). Regardless of how good Nicodemus might have been outwardly, inwardly he had the serpentine nature of Satan. As a descendant of Adam, he was poisoned by the old serpent, and the serpent&rsquo;s nature was within him. He needed the Lord to be in the form of a serpent that his serpentine nature might be dealt with on the cross that he might have eternal life. Nicodemus needed regeneration. He needed to receive another life, the divine life. All the regenerated people will become the Lord&rsquo;s Bride and He will be the Bridegroom. This Bride will be the new creation by regeneration.</p>
<p>To regenerate Nicodemus is one thing and to have others believe in Him because of seeing the miracles He did is another thing. The signs which the Lord did proved to everyone that He was God&rsquo;s sent One. But the Lord would never entrust Himself to those who believed in Him because of seeing the signs. He had no confidence in the miracle seekers.</p>
<p>Many thousands of people were either healed by the Lord or directly affected by the miracles He performed in His earthly ministry. The Lord miraculously fed five thousand people at one time with only five loaves and two fishes (John 6:9-13). The next day He told the same crowd not to labor for the food which perishes, referring to the food He fed them with the day before, but to labor for the eternal food which is the bread of life (John 6:27, 35, 57). He told them to eat Him, that His flesh was good for them to eat and His blood good for them to drink (6:53-54). Then those people who were fed by Him miraculously said, &ldquo;This is a hard word&rdquo; (6:60) and many of them left (6:66). Only a few remained with the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus then asked the twelve if they would leave also. Peter replied, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life&rdquo; (6:68). Peter&rsquo;s attitude was that he and the twelve would never leave the Lord but would stay with Him not to get the physical bread, but to receive the words of eternal life.</p>
<p>In the other synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, this is not pointed out in so much detail. John purposely pointed out that the feeding of the five thousand should be taken as a sign, symbolizing that the Lord is imparting Himself as the bread of life into our spirit. Eventually He said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life&rdquo; and &ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (6:63). The real bread of life is not physical but absolutely wrapped up with the Spirit and with life. Where were those five thousand that were fed by the Lord after His resurrection? The Lord healed, no doubt, thousands of people. Where were those healed ones at the beginning of the book of Acts? How many did the Lord really gain at the conclusion of his earthly ministry? 1 Corinthians 15:6 even tells us that the Lord appeared to five hundred brothers at one time after His resurrection. After the Lord&rsquo;s labor for three and a half years, however, we can only see one hundred and twenty faithful ones. Again, the Lord would not entrust Himself to the miracle seekers. The New Testament ministry ministers the central line of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy to produce the new creation, not to bring forth anything like restoration.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM WITH THE CORINTHIANS</h2>
<p>One of the troubles with the Corinthians was the overemphasis of the speaking in tongues. Speaking with new tongues is one of the five signs listed in Mark 16:17 and 18. To speak with new tongues is one of the five miracles listed here which belong to the coming age. In the first chapter of Corinthians Paul says that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son (v. 9), who is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom to us (v. 24). Christ became wisdom to us from God as righteousness and sanctification and redemption (v. 30). First Corinthians unveils to us that the very Christ, who is the portion of all believers and into whose fellowship we all have been called, is all-inclusive. This book unveils Christ as nineteen wonderful items for our enjoyment (see note 9<sup>2</sup> in 1 Corinthians 1&mdash;Recovery Version). Not one of the nineteen items of Christ revealed in 1 Corinthians indicates any kind of miraculous thing. All these nineteen items of Christ indicate life and the life supply. In 1 Corinthians 14, Paul restricted the abuse and the overuse of tongue speaking. He told the Corinthians clearly that to speak in tongues does not build the church but prophecy does (v. 4). Paul encouraged the saints in Corinth to prophesy, to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, and to speak Christ. One of the reasons for the problems with the Corinthians was their exaltation of the miraculous speaking in tongues.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM WITH THE GALATIANS</h2>
<p>The problem with the Galatians was that they were seduced back to the law. Paul indicated in his Epistle to them that it was absolutely wrong for them to go back to the law because today is the day of grace. What God is mainly doing in the age of grace is to reveal His Son in us (Gal. 1:16a) that His Son may live in us (Gal. 2:20a), that His Son may be formed in us (Gal 4:19), and that we may be clothed with His Son (Gal. 3:27). &ldquo;For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation&rdquo; (Gal. 6:15).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM WITH THE HEBREWS</h2>
<p>Now we must see what the problem was with the Hebrews. They had been enlightened, they had tasted of the heavenly gift, they had received the Holy Spirit, and were even partaking of this Holy Spirit. They had also tasted the good word of God, but they remained in the initial stage of the enjoyment of the New Testament blessings. The good word of God in 6:5 refers to the word of the beginning of the Christ mentioned in 6:1, which is the milk the Hebrew believers tasted when they believed in the Lord. The good word of God is milk, whereas the word of righteousness is solid food.</p>
<p>Hebrews 5:12 says, &ldquo;For when because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what are the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food.&rdquo; This verse tells us that the word of God is likened to milk and solid food. The rudiments or primary elements of the beginning of the oracles of God are in the category of the word as milk not as solid food. Verse 13 continues, &ldquo;For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.&rdquo; Many of us are familiar with the word of life and the word of grace, but I do not think many Christians have a thought concerning the word of righteousness. The word of righteousness is the solid food and is not for babes. Everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness. The word of righteousness is a word on a higher level and is something deeper. Paul&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;inexperienced&rdquo; indicates that we need to experience the word of righteousness. From the point of our regeneration in the Lord we began to know the word of life (Phil. 2:16), the word of grace (Acts 20:32), the word of the truth (Eph. 1:13), and the word of the gospel (Acts 15:7). We not only acquired the knowledge of these kinds of words, but we also had the experience. But how many of us have adequately experienced the word of righteousness? Verse 14 says, &ldquo;But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil.&rdquo; To fully enter into the word of righteousness, we need experience and we need exercise.</p>
<p>The entire revelation of the book of Hebrews shows us that Christ has an earthly ministry and also a heavenly ministry. In His earthly ministry, He was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected. Through that ministry we were all redeemed back to God through &ldquo;repentance from dead works and of faith toward God&rdquo; (Heb. 6:1). Through His earthly ministry we were also baptized into Him (6:2a) and all our negative things were washed away and terminated. Repentance from dead works, faith toward God, and baptism are mentioned as the beginning of the doctrine concerning Christ, the good word of God, in Hebrews 6:1 and 2. To merely tell people in preaching the gospel that Christ was the Son of God who died on the cross for sinners is to preach the good word of God referring to Christ&rsquo;s ministry on this earth.</p>
<p>The Hebrews received the gospel to this extent, but they never realized that Christ has another ministry, a ministry in the heavens. Now they must go on from the good word of God to the deeper word, the word of righteousness (5:13), which is not mainly concerned with God&rsquo;s redemption but with the way of His economy, and which is the solid food for them to reach maturity (6:1). Therefore, the book of Hebrews was written to bring the Hebrew believers on from the good word of God concerning Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry to the word of righteousness concerning His heavenly ministry, from the first, initial stage of God&rsquo;s salvation to the full stage of God&rsquo;s salvation. This book&rsquo;s intention is to bring the childish believers on to maturity, from the earth to the heavens. It even tells us that we are partakers of a heavenly calling (3:1). Hebrews also mentions the heavenly gifts (6:4), the heavenly things (8:5), the heavenly country (11:16), and the heavenly Jerusalem (12:22). Eventually this book points out to us that today the very Christ who died on the cross and who made the new covenant for us is now in the heavens as the heavenly Minister, the heavenly High Priest, and the heavenly Mediator of the new covenant. He is in the heavenlies to minister all the blessings of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy into His chosen people.</p>
<p>The Hebrew believers were remaining in the initial stage of salvation and would not go on to the heavenly ministry of Christ. In Hebrews 6:1 Paul says, &ldquo;Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us be brought on to maturity.&rdquo; The word of the beginning of the Christ is the good word of God mentioned in 6:5. Leaving the good word of God, we need to be brought on to maturity, which is to advance from Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry to His heavenly ministry. The heavenly Christ is in the Holy of Holies in the heavenly tabernacle and the way into the Holy of Holies has been made for us. Now we all have to enter into the Holy of Holies in the heavens where Christ is.</p>
<p>In Hebrews 6:4 and 5 we saw that the Hebrew believers had tasted four things which are the genuine blessings assigned to us for the new creation&mdash;the heavenly light, the heavenly gift, the Holy Spirit, and the good word of God. In addition to this, the Hebrews had also tasted the works of power of the coming age, the miracles. The Hebrew believers had tasted, in the first stage of God&rsquo;s salvation, the good word of God and the works of power of the coming age. This shows us that miracles are not in the stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, but in the initial stage of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WANING OF THE MIRACULOUS THINGS</h2>
<p>In the book of Acts miracles followed the apostles&rsquo; preaching of the gospel. Eventually, in the book of Acts, though, there is a strong indication that the miracles were waning. In Acts 2 and 4 the believers had all their possessions in common. This practice, however, did not last long. Paul told us in 2 Corinthians that he was &ldquo;in fastings often&rdquo; (11:27). Since fastings are listed in this verse with hardships, they must refer to involuntary fasting due to lack of food; hence they differ from hunger. Hunger may refer to a situation where there is no way to obtain food; involuntary fasting may refer to a situation of poverty. There was a time when Paul lacked food and no one in the churches was sharing with him. Paul was such a great apostle who established so many churches, yet no church among these churches would have anything in common with him. He was forced to make tents for a living (Acts 18:3; 20:34).</p>
<p>To have everything in common according to what was practiced in the book of Acts was altogether over by Paul&rsquo;s time. Paul even had to exhort the Corinthians to bring their money on the first day of every week to give to the Lord (1 Cor. 16:2). If they were not reluctant to do this, Paul would not have charged them in such a way. The Corinthians did not have all things in common. Paul even begged them to share their wealth with the poor saints in Judea (2 Cor. 8:8-15). The strongest miracle in the New Testament is not healing, but having all things in common. To heal a sick person is not as great as to make everything common among thousands of people. Only the Lord could perform such a miraculous thing among people. This great miracle, this &ldquo;bright moon,&rdquo; only shined for a short time. It had waned by the time of the Apostle Paul. Throughout church history there were a number of times when Christians tried to practice having everything in common. Every time they tried they experienced failure. The biggest item of the miracles recorded in Acts, having everything in common, took the lead to wane.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul also healed people miraculously. Acts 19:11 and 12 say, &ldquo;And God did extraordinary works of power through the hands of Paul, so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and their diseases left them, and the evil spirits went out.&rdquo; Despite the extraordinary works of power God performed through Paul, Paul eventually had a thorn in his flesh which God would not remove. Paul entreated the Lord three times that this thorn might depart from him, but the Lord responded to Paul by saying that he had to enjoy and experience His sufficient grace. Paul also told us that he labored more abundantly than all the apostles, yet he said it was not him but the grace of God (1 Cor. 15:10). Paul&rsquo;s experience and labor was of and by the divine grace, which is the Triune God as life to us for our enjoyment. The Gospel of John tells us that when the Lord came, grace came and that He as the incarnated God was full of grace (1:14, 17).</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s intimate spiritual son, Timothy, was instructed by Paul to take the natural way for healing his stomach sickness. In 2 Timothy 4:20 Paul said, &ldquo;Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.&rdquo; Paul left such an intimate one in sickness without exercising any healing prayer for him. Paul and his co-workers were under the discipline of the inner life in this time of suffering rather than under the power of the outward gift. The former is of grace and in life; the latter of gift and power&mdash; miraculous power. In the decline of the church and in suffering for the church, the gift of power is not as much needed as the grace in life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Peter was once rescued miraculously from prison by an angel of the Lord (Acts 12:7). Paul also was rescued miraculously from prison at Philippi (Acts 16:26). Eventually, however, both Peter and Paul were imprisoned and martyred. They were among the many thousands of martyrs put to death by the Roman Empire. Why did the Lord not perform any miracles to rescue them?</p>
<p>Most of the healings I saw in the Pentecostal movement were false healings. But I can testify that Brother Nee and I both experienced the healing of grace. I nearly died of tuberculosis at one time and also had a serious stomach ailment. I was healed of both of these illnesses. I was ill for nearly two and a half years with tuberculosis on my lungs, learning the lesson of grace and not of miraculous healing. After I recovered from this illness and began to minister the word in 1946, I have been laboring vigorously both day and night with nearly no time for vacation. Even today I am still physically strong, not by miraculous healing but by the Lord&rsquo;s merciful healing of grace. Thousands of seekers of Christ can all testify to the same experience I had. They did not have a miraculous healing, but they enjoyed a kind of healing through the lessons of life. This is what George M&#252;ller called the healing by grace, not the healing by gift.</p>
<p>Any group throughout church history that practiced the gift of healing extensively, has been eventually exposed for pretense and falsehood. One brother among us, who was once a missionary to Indonesia, participated in a Pentecostal revival there. Some of the believers asked the Lord to change water into wine for their Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. One of their leaders performed a certain ritual to change the water into wine. During this ritual, the brother who now meets with us saw this Pentecostal leader about to add something to the water to change it into &ldquo;wine.&rdquo; When this leader realized he was being watched, he stopped what he was doing and waited until a later time to &ldquo;change the water into wine.&rdquo; What a falsehood!</p>
<p>What the Lord is doing in this dispensation of grace is the work in our spirit for the new creation. A number of good saints who were very much used by the Lord died in sickness. They were never healed by the Lord. Many Christians who were all seeking, spiritual, and mature, eventually had a certain kind of disease that ended their life. They never were healed. Brother Nee was healed of tuberculosis on the lungs, and this was a real healing of the Lord. Meanwhile, he also had heart disease and this was never healed. For over forty years he suffered the effects of this disease and eventually he died of it. In the dispensation of grace the Lord&rsquo;s work is for the new creation not for the old creation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MIRACULOUS THINGS BEING<br />
IN THE KINDERGARTEN STAGE<br />
AND DISTRACTING PEOPLE<br />
FROM GOD&rsquo;S MAIN WORK<br />
TO PRODUCE THE NEW CREATION</h2>
<p>The miracles, including tongue-speaking do not belong to the word of righteousness but are listed with the good word of God, the word of the beginning of the Christ, which is in the &ldquo;kindergarten&rdquo; stage of the Christian life. Paul&rsquo;s burden in the book of Hebrews was to bring the believers out of the kindergarten stage and to bring them on to maturity, to the word of righteousness concerning Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry, concerning the way of His economy, which is the solid food for them to reach maturity. In the New Testament age God&rsquo;s main work is to bring forth the new creation, and the new creation work is based upon regeneration in our spirit by God&rsquo;s divine life, not by any miracle. From the time of regeneration, God continues to renew us, to sanctify us dispositionally, to transform us from one degree of glory to another degree of glory, and eventually to conform us to the image of the firstborn Son of God unto glorification. This is the main work of God in the New Testament age to create His new creation.</p>
<p>Especially at the initial stage of the New Testament in the Acts, God used miracles but these miracles including speaking in tongues, are absolutely related to the physical life. For this reason, the miraculous things would be easily accepted by people and would easily attract people. Once people get attracted to the miraculous things, it is hard for you to get them away from them and to bring them to the enjoyment of Christ Himself as life. Medical doctors to some extent prescribe morphine for certain diseases. It is very effective, but it must be prescribed in a limited, restricted way. If you use it without any limitation, you will get addicted and this addiction will eventually kill you. Morphine is good but it should not be taken as food. In this sense, the miraculous things can also become addicting.</p>
<p>I have been observing the so-called miraculous things for close to sixty years. Once one gets this kind of so-called experience of the miracles or of tongue-speaking, there is a strong tendency for them to become addicted to it. This addiction always frustrates them from going on in the inner life. I am so strong against the overemphasis of the miraculous things because I know the subtlety of the enemy. The miraculous things are not only a real attraction but also a distraction. Once you get addicted to morphine, you will always come to it again and again even though you know it is not so healthy. We should weigh everything against the truth concerning the New Testament economy of God.</p>
<p>The miraculous things can distract people from God&rsquo;s main work to produce the new creation. God produces the new creation by regenerating the fallen and dead creation with His own divine life in the very spirit of the fallen and dead people, whom He chose in eternity past, to make them a new creation. This is accomplished by Himself as the divine life, as the Spirit, entering into His chosen peoples&rsquo; spirit to regenerate them, to sanctify them, to transform them, and to conform them unto glorification. This has nothing to do with miracles. All these miraculous things, including speaking in tongues, belong to the coming age.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MIRACULOUS THINGS IMITATED BY THE<br />
UNBELIEVERS AND PERFORMED BY THE ENEMY</h2>
<p>It has been documented that the Mormons, in their early days, practiced all the miracles, including tongue-speaking. It has also been documented that not only the Mormons practiced tongue-speaking but also the ancient Egyptians spoke in tongues. Furthermore, tongue-speaking was a Gentile phenomenon in the ancient Han dynasty of China. A brother among us from Ghana told us that he saw tongue-speaking by the pagan priests and priestesses in their idol worship. During their religious festivities, some kind of ecstasy would come upon the priests and priestesses and at some point they would speak in something other than the language they spoke in Ghana. They would speak something and this would be interpreted in a way of prophecy. The townspeople would try to check out which of the priests and priestesses were false and which ones were not. There were times when what they prophesied came true. If they spoke something that did not happen, however, everybody would mock them for a long time. When this brother from Ghana was saved and saw Christians doing similar things, that was quite a surprise to him. This shows that the miraculous things can be performed by the enemy (2 Thes. 2:9). At least the people in this village in Ghana checked out the prophecy to see whether or not it would come true. Many in Pentecostalism, however, prophesy falsely and are never exposed. All the works of power (miracles), including tongue-speaking, can be imitated by unbelievers. But the matter of regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification by God as the Spirit with His divine life in our spirit eventually saturating our entire body could never be imitated by anyone.</p>
<p>Karl Marx invented communism by picking up the word in Acts 2:44 concerning having everything in common. The Communists are attempting to practice having everything in common. Through the centuries some groups of Christians always tried their best to imitate these miraculous things such as practicing having everything in common, healings, tongue-speaking, and other miracles. These things can be taken and imitated by people in a natural way. However, God&rsquo;s full salvation which issues in God&rsquo;s new creation and begins from regeneration, passing through sanctification, transformation, conformation, and reaching glorification can never be imitated.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TREASURING THE DIVINE WORK<br />
FOR THE NEW CREATION</h2>
<p>I hope that by His mercy all of us have seen something concerning the truth of dispensations. Miracles are not designed by our God for this age but for the coming age. Yet in this age, there is sometimes the need of miraculous things to prove that what God does in this age is genuine. What He is doing in this age, however, is altogether not in the physical realm but in the realm of our spirit. The majority of the New Testament writings are for God&rsquo;s work in our spirit. Only a small percentage of the New Testament refers to God&rsquo;s work in the physical realm. Whatever God works in the physical realm is a miracle, but whatever God does in our spirit, in the realm of our spirit, is not miraculous but divine. We treasure the divine work. We do not care much for the miraculous work because that work does not belong to us in this age. That belongs to God&rsquo;s restoration work in the coming age.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE HOME MEETINGS, MIGRATION, <br />
AND FULL-TIME WORKERS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>I do hope that all the churches would practice the small home meetings. This does not mean that we should annul the big meetings, the general gathering of the whole church, on the Lord&rsquo;s day morning. I feel we still need that meeting, but we should try our best not to practice in the old way of only one or two gifted brothers speaking, with the other saints only sharing a little bit. Give up that way. Practice in another way&mdash;the way of mutuality in speaking. The elders have to bear the responsibility according to the various situations of their localities, but the principle is to give up the traditional way of having one or two speakers with the rest as the audience. We have been practicing this for some years. Now I feel we have to give the Lord an opportunity to have the freedom to work out His own way, invented and ordained by Him. God&rsquo;s way is for His children to be gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name in mutuality in speaking.</p>
<p>Let the saints have the full opportunity to learn how to speak in the meetings for the Lord. For this there is the need of much labor on the part of the elders. The elders have to consider what to cover in such a big meeting, yet with mutuality in speaking. This is a hard job. We need much labor to help all the saints to realize the new way and to participate in the divine speaking mutually. Do not wait to take this way, thinking you are unable to practice it. If you could not do it well the first time, try the second time, the third time, and the fourth time. We believe that where there is a will there is a way. In this matter we can quote Philippians 4:13: &ldquo;I can do all things,&rdquo; especially to carry on the small meetings, &ldquo;in Him who empowers me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have been practicing the church life since 1932. According to all that I have observed and experienced, the best way to meet is to be gathered with mutuality in speaking. This is the Lord&rsquo;s invented, created, and ordained way. We have no choice but to take this way.</p>
<p>The truth concerning the small group meetings is mainly based upon Acts, where there is the meeting from house to house (2:46; 5:42; 20:20). &ldquo;House to house&rdquo; indicates every house. I told the church in Taipei to practice this way, yet they did not practice this way absolutely according to the modifier &ldquo;house to house.&rdquo; What they did was to have a few families gathered in one house. They were charged not to exceed ten and to split into two home meetings when they reached twelve. I believe that for the long run, as we are faithful to the Lord, going on in His invented and ordained way, we all will learn something. Even the new converts should begin to meet in their homes immediately after their regeneration. If they just begin to meet in their home with their spouse and children once a week, this will be a big advance.</p>
<p>The elders do not need to regulate the home meetings. You do not need to tell the saints in the home meetings to meet to preach the gospel or to seek after the deeper truth. They can meet at their liberty. This week they may feel led of the Lord to speak the gospel, and two or three will get saved. The next week they may spend the whole meeting for prayer. There is nothing wrong with this. For the elders to interfere with the home meetings or to regulate them is not healthy or profitable. There is no need for the elders to make a decision that this week is a gospel week, and that all the home meetings have to preach the gospel. Even there is no need for the elders to make a decision as to where a home meeting should be held. We should let anyone have a home meeting in their home who wants to. They do not need to come to the elders to get their home meeting &ldquo;registered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some elders may think that the saints have no right to establish a meeting in their homes without the permission of the elders. There is no need of such a control. You may be afraid that they may start a meeting to cause division. But we must trust in the living Lord. He is living and He will take care of the church. Sometimes our control creates trouble. Some who make trouble in the church according to our feeling, actually do not make trouble. We should all do our best not to control the saints or the home meetings. We all have to do our best to start the home meetings in our locality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MIGRATION</h2>
<p>According to the New Testament, we believers should not get ourselves settled once for all. We need to make a living and we need housing. I like to see all of you have comfortable houses, but we should always be on the alert because at any time there might be the need for the Lord to move us elsewhere. We are sojourners on the earth (1 Peter 2:11a). The Lord may want us to stay in a certain place for another year or for another ten years. Only the Lord knows. On the other hand, the Lord may lead us to go to another country, to another city, or to another state.</p>
<p>I feel that some brothers, especially from the Orange County area of California, should pick up the burden to move to where the Lord has a need. Many of you have been under this ministry and the practice of the church life for many years. According to your consideration, you do not know much or have much. I believe, however, that when you pick up a burden from the Lord to go to another place, you will discover that actually, comparatively speaking, you know a lot and can do a lot. Some places need someone who has had some experience in the church life for a number of years. The saints who have been with us in Orange County under the ministry for over eight years have unconsciously and unknowingly had something deposited in them. If some of these saints who love the Lord enter into an environment where their experience is needed, they would be very useful.</p>
<p>The elders should fellowship with the saints often concerning migration. We should never command the saints to go to a certain place, but we should make them aware of the need. We believe the Lord is living. Through this kind of fellowship, the Lord will lead some to pick up the burden and they will go. When they go to a new place, they will discover that they are very useful to the Lord.</p>
<p>One brother talked to me about his health problems and I told him that according to my consideration the best environment for his physical problem was Flagstaff, Arizona. Eventually this brother picked up a burden to move there. By his moving there, there is now a small church in Flagstaff. After moving there, this brother became very useful to the Lord. Many of the Orange County saints have been with us for at least five or eight years. They have been faithful in attending the regular church meetings and the ministry meetings and from these meetings they have picked up something solid of life and truth. Something has been imparted into them. If they remain where they are, though, they may not be of much use to the Lord. If they go to a new place, they will be very useful.</p>
<p>On nearly every college campus in the United States, there is a Chinese Christian group meeting together. Most of the leaders of these Chinese groups are ones who were with us in Taiwan. They were considered to be the &ldquo;weaker ones&rdquo; among us, but when they went out they became the leaders of these groups. This shows that the attending of the meetings of the church really means something. We all need to pray that many of the saints would pick up the burden for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p><h2 class="head1">FULL-TIME WORKERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Need of More Full-Time Workers</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is in need of more full-time workers. Throughout the years in the United States, we did not promote this, yet a good number of brothers were raised up by the Lord to take the full-time way. However, we need many more full-timers. According to my observation, a number of you who are elders should go full-time. The Lord knows who you are. Just be faithful to His speaking and His leading to go full-time.</p>
<p>When I went to Taiwan in October of 1984, there were very few full-timers. Now in Taipei alone, there are at least one hundred full-time workers. Recently, they went to the city every day not to preach, but to speak the gospel. Also, some individuals from the small group gatherings joined them mostly in the evening. Within three weeks and with the help of the college students who were on vacation, these full-time workers brought in eleven hundred and four people and all of these were baptized.</p>
<p>Without time we can do nothing, and our body is fully in time. Romans 12:1 tells us to present our body. Actually, this means to present our time. If you do not present your time, how could your body be presented? You may say that you will present your body and reserve your time, but your body goes with your time. Thus, there is the need of a good number of saints who are ready, according to God&rsquo;s sight, to go full-time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Living of Full-Time Workers</h2>
<p>There is a great problem concerning full-timers which demands our attention&mdash;the matter of how to make a living by going full-time. The strangest thing concerning this is that from Paul&rsquo;s time up to now this problem has never been solved. The New Testament does not give us any kind of resolution to this problem. Paul was the foremost apostle (1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 12:11). He did the top work and the result and the blessing he enjoyed from his work were all on the top. He was highly regarded and respected by all the churches. Such a one, however, was forced to make tents not only to feed himself but also to feed his co-workers (Acts 18:3; 20:34-35). Surely Paul was much wiser than all of us. Why did he not exercise his wise mind to tell all the churches who were under his ministry to donate a certain portion of their proceeds to him? If he had done this, he might have been rich. He would not have needed to make tents. Those of us who take the full-time way or who are going to take the full-time way have to see something here. Paul never made such a resolution. You may wonder how you can live if you go full-time. My answer is this&mdash;just live. Do not say anything to anyone about your need; just live. If you cannot live, go back to work.</p>
<p>All the denominations have their regulations concerning ways to raise funds to take care of their workers. The China Inland Mission was famous for not having a set system of paying their workers. They trusted in the Lord for their living, but their trusting was corporate not individual. All the offerings would come to the central office of the China Inland Mission&rsquo;s headquarters. These gifts would be distributed to all their missionaries by percentage. Every missionary had to be fearful and trembling. A certain missionary living in the interior of China did not know how much money would come into the central office. If very few offerings came, this missionary may have cause for much concern. Therefore, the China Inland missionaries all prayed to the Lord, trusting Him for their living. All the missionaries of other denominations were different from the China Inland Mission. Their missionaries were promised a certain allowance to take care of the needs of their living.</p>
<p>Our practice in this matter was not exactly the same as that of the China Inland Mission. Brother Nee was the first one among us to take the full-time way. He just lived without any promise from anyone or from any church to support him. He lived by faith and he even told his parents not to take care of him. Those of us who went full-time after him followed his pattern. I must testify that to take this way was really hard. We never made any arrangement for the church to give us a certain monthly allowance. I began to be full-time in 1933. It was not until 1946, by the time I had gone to Shanghai, that the church in Shanghai gave the full-time workers a certain amount of cash every month. Before 1946 I never received any regular supply from any church, even from the church in Chefoo, which I was directly taking care of. Within the five years I stayed in Chefoo, I cannot remember ever having received some material supply from the church. You may wonder how I lived in those years. I just lived. Sometimes I lived by poverty. Sometimes I lived by my family&rsquo;s suffering. But I never made a demand on the church. I did not tell the church that since I was serving there full-time I needed a living. As full-time workers, if we are short of something, we only tell God and tell our poverty. This is why we have surely seen and experienced some miracles regarding the Lord taking care of our living.</p>
<p>I was once assigned by Brother Nee, the leading one in the work, to move my family from Chefoo to a big city in north China, a port city close to the old capital of Peking. The cost of living there was very expensive. I moved there and no church gave me any support. The assigning work did not say anything about my supply. That was our practice. The work, the ministry, only assigned you work to do. They never cared for your need. That was our way.</p>
<p>I moved there firstly by myself, and when I looked at the situation in that big city, I realized that in order to travel and visit others I needed a bicycle. I had only a little over forty dollars in my pocket, which I kept to move my family which included my wife and three children. I needed a bicycle badly, so I prayed to the Lord. I still remember where I kneeled down to ask the Lord to meet my need. In that prayer I was so clear that the Lord was telling me from within to go to buy a bicycle although I only had a little over forty dollars, which was just enough to bring my wife and three children to be with me. Later, a certain brother went with me to visit another brother. After visiting that brother, we two brothers went to a food market. When we came out of the market, we saw a new bicycle standing there. I told the brother with me that this was the kind of bicycle I wanted to buy. Immediately, the owner came out, and I asked him where I could buy such a bicycle and how much it would cost. Then he told me the place and the price. We brothers went to that store and there was such a bicycle for sale there, already assembled. The salesman told me the price was thirty-two dollars, including tax and license. I paid him the thirty-two dollars and took the bike home.</p>
<p>After coming back home, I was happy that I had a bicycle which would be so useful to me in that big city. I went upstairs to the very place where I initially knelt down to pray and gave thanks to the Lord. While I was giving thanks to the Lord, He asked me to count how much money I had received since He told me to buy the bicycle up until the time I paid the thirty-two dollars for it. My prayer for the bicycle was on a Saturday when a certain brother came to see me. We had a long talk and when he left he told me he had a letter for me. Actually, it was not a letter but an envelope, within which was ten dollars. On the next day, the Lord&rsquo;s day, I received a two-dollar gift from the offering box. The very next morning, Monday morning, I received some registered mail from another city. This mail contained a postal money order for twenty dollars. I and the other brother with me went to the post office that same day to cash that money order. It was on that Monday that we also saw the bicycle I purchased, and I had not counted the money I had received from the Lord as gifts. When I added the amounts of ten dollars, two dollars, and twenty dollars, and realized that the Lord had supplied me with thirty-two dollars, the exact amount of the bicycle, I wept before the Lord. How faithful He was! This is one example among the many ways the Lord took care of my practical needs. The Lord sovereignly arranged for me to see that bicycle and supplied me with the exact amount for it. The Lord is truly marvelous! This was one of my experiences concerning trusting in the Lord for my living.</p>
<p>My family and I lived in that large city for one year up until the end of 1936. At the end of the year, I received a cable from Brother Nee asking me to come join him for a co-workers&rsquo; conference. I went to this conference and afterwards I visited quite a number of cities. I traveled during January and February, not being able to return home until some time in March. I left my home and my family without much money. By that time I had four children. One day when I was gone, my wife realized that the next day they would have nothing to live on. My wife was not the kind of person who contacted people frequently, so she had no person to pray with. She only asked our oldest child, who at that time was about seven, and his sister who was five to pray with her. They knelt down by the bed and prayed, &ldquo;Lord, we are in this situation and you know we do not know what to live on tomorrow.&rdquo; It was winter at that time. That evening it was snowing heavily. About ten o&rsquo;clock at night an old sister came in a car to our residence and knocked on the door. She came in and told my wife that something was bothering her, telling her to come and see my wife. Then she said, &ldquo;The Lord told me to come with this,&rdquo; and she gave my wife a large sum of money to take care of her and our children. This older sister had never had any contact with me. She only came to the church meetings. Neither had she had any talk with my wife before that time, and she had never come to visit us in our house. But late in the night, under heavy snowing, she came urgently. Was this not a miracle? That was the way we passed through to be full-time for the Lord.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we who take the way of full-time have no right to ask the church to give us anything. Whether the church would give or would not give us something is up to the church. We have no right to ask or, needless to say, to require or demand others to supply our need. We have only one right&mdash;to trust in the Lord in suffering poverty.</p>
<p>I was sick for two and a half years with tuberculosis during the time that the Japanese army invaded China. China was in a hard situation in that year of 1943. The war had been going on for over six years already and the economic situation of China was really poor. I was very sick and I needed a lot of good care. My wife and my children were in a hard time. She and the children began to eat the kind of food which at that time was only good for feeding the pigs. The poorest people in north China sometimes ate this kind of food. My family was also forced at times by being short of supply to eat that kind of pig food. And in north China we needed coal to burn in the stoves for cooking. My wife went to the seashore like the poor people to pick up things that were carried to the shore by the tide. The waves carried a lot of things which would be good for fuel. When my sister got to know that, she advised my wife not to do this since only the poor people did this. But this was what we suffered in order to serve the Lord with our full-time. We only have the right to tell the Lord our need, and we only have the right to tell our poverty.</p>
<p>When I was sent to Taiwan from Shanghai, the church in Shanghai did not give me one dollar. Brother Nee personally gave me about three hundred dollars, and that was all the money I had when I went to Taiwan. When I went to Taiwan, I took my wife, eight children, and two maids. The older maid had served my family for three generations. She was a widow and it was hard for us to leave her. The second maid, a younger sister, served my family in Nanking for some years. She was a divorced young lady. When we were leaving Shanghai, she cried. We were the ones who brought her to the Lord. My wife and I decided that as long as we could go to Taiwan we should also bring her. We brought these two maids with us, not for help, but out of love. Therefore, we had twelve people living together in one place. The three hundred dollars I had was only good for us to live on for three months. This was all I had to go to Taiwan to begin the work there. I never told any co-worker what I needed. I never told any church what I needed. You all would suppose that I should have been the second one, next to Brother Nee, among the saints who was highly regarded in the recovery, yet this was my financial condition.</p>
<p>If you demand, require, or even ask others to supply your need, this is absolutely a shame. This is not only wrong; this is a shame. If you cannot go this way of being full-time, go back to work. On the one hand, I encourage so many of you to go full-time; but on the other hand, I would advise you that if you go this way, you only have the right to tell your need to the Lord and your poverty. Please go back to do a regular job if you cannot take this way. Whoever goes full-time should be clear that we have no right to ask anyone to supply us. I came to this country and worked so hard for the church in Los Angeles in 1964. For that whole year, the church in Los Angeles probably only gave me no more than eight hundred dollars. I know this because in 1965 I asked a brother to take care of my income tax. He told me that for the whole year of 1964 the church in Los Angeles had not given me over eight hundred dollars.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this way should be carried out by the full-timers. But on the other hand, all the churches, with all the saints, should be faithful in giving. These are two sides. The churches with all the saints should be careful, should be diligent, and should be faithful in giving to take care of the need. Paul says that all the people working for the gospel have the right to live of the gospel (1 Cor. 9:14), but not according to the traditional way. We are here for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Even though we do not practice having everything in common, we do practice our faithfulness for His unique purpose on this earth.</p>
<p>I believe the elders should teach the saints concerning these kinds of things quite often to bring them to a full knowledge of the Lord&rsquo;s move. I told the saints in the church in Taipei that out of twenty saints there should be one full-timer. If your church has one hundred, you should have at least five full-timers, but not officially or legally. The one who becomes full-time has no right to ask any of the nineteen to take care of him. Once I discovered something like this, I would advise that brother to go back to his job. It is a shame to tell the supporting ones how much you need. This is begging. We take the way of living by faith. You go this way of being full-time because you believe the One whom you serve is the living One. You do not trust any human being. On the other hand, all the saints should be faithful to give, and the entire church should endeavor to take care of the need of the full-timers. I encourage many of you to be full-time, but once you do you have no right to ask any church to support you. That is a real shame. On the other hand, every church with every saint must be faithful to make more money for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. We believe the Lord is living and He is real. Someday we will stand before His judgment seat and He will judge us (2 Cor. 5:10). Let us live such a life which is termed the kingdom life. We should really mean business with the Lord.</p>
<p>If the church feels it does not want to take care of a certain brother because he is not faithful, it does not need to. Neither does that brother need to go full-time. He should go back to do a job. He should not take a way that forces others to talk about him in a negative way. This is too poor and it is a shame before man and even before the angels and demons.</p>
<p>We should be glorious; we should be dignified. I would never beg. To beg is a shame. For over fifty-three years I never begged. Rather, I spent my money splendidly. When I gave, I gave splendidly. People wondered where I received the money; the Lord has always supplied me. I suffered poverty and my entire family suffered poverty to the uttermost because of His sake. Today we are happy about it. This is our way. On the other hand, we must remember that the saints and the churches should be faithful to the uttermost in giving to Him for His up-to-date move.</p></body></html>
