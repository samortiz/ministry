   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL THE NORMAL RELATIONSHIPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BETWEEN GOD AND MAN BEING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ultimate consummation of this Triune God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His very nature is also the Spirit because God is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not only so, the last Person of this Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Father is in the Son, and the Son is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the Triune God ultimately is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This God, who is the Spirit and whose last Person of the Divine Trinity is also the Spirit, has passed through various processes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, He has entered into resurrection in His divinity with His humanity to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the Lord in resurrection has breathed Himself as the all-inclusive Spirit into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This very God in whom we believe is altogether a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the purpose of dispensing this Spirit into us, God in His creation of man particularly created a spirit for him that he might receive this God who is the Spirit by the spirit and with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then, when He came back in His resurrection, the first thing He did was to enter into man s spirit to regenerate his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is spoken of as that which is born of the Spirit is spirit John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a matter of the Spirit begetting the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we want to worship God, we must worship Him in our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a matter of the spirit worshipping the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today all the relationships between man and God are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One of the Chinese hymns contains this word: All the normal relationships between God and man are altogether in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The chorus says, The Spirit begets the spirit, the spirit worships the Spirit, and eventually the Spirit will fill me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit witnesses with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It does not say here that the Lord should be with our mind, or that the Lord should be with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, it says, The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This clearly shows us that our spirit is the unique place where the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Also, Matthew 10:32 says, Every one therefore who in Me shall confess Me before men, I also in him will confess him before My Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here it says that our confessing of the Lord is a matter of us in Him confessing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord s confessing of us is the Lord in us confessing us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that whenever we call on the Lord s name, we are in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As soon as we confess the Lord Jesus, we are in the spirit, and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our union with the Lord can reach such a degree!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, in John 15:4, the Lord said, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the end of John 17, the Lord prayed, saying, You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they the disciples also may be in Us the Triune God v. 21 . Today we believers are in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is altogether a matter of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>TO BE FILLED WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BEING A NORMAL MATTER</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Christianity, most of the teachers consider the matter of being filled with the Spirit as a very miraculous and extraordinary thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fundamental Christianity does not touch this matter much.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the other hand, the Pentecostals touch this matter in an improper way; they are too wild.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, according to the Bible, God, having passed through the different processes, became the life-giving Spirit and breathed Himself into His believers, that is, into His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, our being filled with the Triune God is a very normal matter, as normal as our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the New Testament Christ came; hence, the New Testament is the age of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then Christ went through death and resurrection to become the Spirit; hence, the New Testament is also the age of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, the Spirit has become the word; hence, the New Testament is also the age of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Romans 10:8 says, The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as you receive any gospel word in the Bible, this word within you is Spirit, and this Spirit is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, today it is not too difficult to be filled with the Triune God; rather, it is a miraculous normality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Romans 10:13 says, For, whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once you call on the name of the Lord, the Lord who is the Spirit within you will carry out His deliverance so that you may obtain salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nothing can be more normal than this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a sinner hears the gospel, he is moved to repent and call on the Lord from within, saying, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Forgive my sins!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I receive You.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is in this simple way that the Lord the Spirit comes into him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To be filled in the Spirit is just as normal as this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>PRACTICING TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>BY CALLING ON THE LORD AND</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>SPEAKING THE LORD ALL THE DAY LONG</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After we have received the Lord in this way, we need to always say, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You don t need to analyze whether this calling is in the spirit or not.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You simply call.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all have had experiences like these.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we weep, repent, and call on the name of the Lord, we always have a very good feeling and the sense of the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>That is the Triune God filling us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At such a time, the sense within us is that the Lord Jesus seems to be right before us; it seems that we have entered into an atmosphere that causes us to feel very sweet, satisfied, and comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, when we get up in the morning, the best thing for us to do is not to think about other things, but only to think about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is easy to talk about this, but it is not simple to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is because we all have many things filling our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In spite of this, we still need to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is a difference between calling on the Lord the first thing before getting out of bed, and getting out of bed without calling.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You need to call on the Lord in this way in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then during the whole day, you need to practice speaking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When there is no one with you, you should call on the Lord Jesus; when there are others with you, you should speak the Lord Jesus to them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Eventually, what you breathe is the Lord Jesus, and what you speak is also the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then you will definitely be filled with the Triune God who is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I hope that you will start practicing in this way from today on.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You should begin with calling on the Lord before getting out of bed, and then during the day, either call on the Lord or speak the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As soon as you call on the Lord s name, the Spirit is with you; as soon as you speak the Lord s word, the Spirit will be with you even more.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Romans 12:11 says that we have to be burning and hot in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When you call on the Lord as soon as you get up in the morning, you will be hot in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When you call a few more times, you will become burning in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you will also speak the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit will fill you within.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is a very normal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This should be our normal daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on October 13, 1987.</S>
