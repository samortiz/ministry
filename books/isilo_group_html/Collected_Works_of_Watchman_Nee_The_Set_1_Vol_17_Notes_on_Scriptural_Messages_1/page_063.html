What did the Lord say to the disciples? He said, "I am moved with compassion for the crowd, because for three days now they have remained with Me and they do not have anything to eat" (Matt. 15:32). What does "and" indicate? It indicates that the Lord had not eaten for three days either. This is why it says "and they do not have anything to eat." It would have been very legitimate for the Lord to send His disciples to buy food when He had nothing to eat. But He was more concerned about their not having eaten for three days than He was about His not having eaten for three days. If the Lord had cared for His own eating, then at Pentecost there would have been a few more Ananiases and Sapphiras who would have withheld certain portions for themselves. For the sake of His disciples, the Lord sanctified Himself. He was restricted not only in His physical body, but He was restricted also spiritually. How He suffered!</P><P>Likewise, brothers who are more advanced in the Lord and who have learned more lessons, have had more experiences, have a keener conscience, and know God more clearly, will not do many things that they would otherwise have the liberty to do. Although these things are altogether lawful and not sinful, they would not do them for the sake of the younger brothers. For example, many times I have felt this suffering when I stayed with young brothers. One may need more rest because of his physical weakness. Fearing that this may lead others to become lazy, he does not rest as much as necessary. When he loses sleep at night, he should be able to rise up a little later. But for the sake of the weaker brothers who would also rise up late and miss their morning prayer and Scripture reading, he suffers and rises up early. He may have a stomach problem and should be more selective in his eating. But in so doing it may cause the younger ones to be choosy in what they eat. As a result, he does not eat as he should. This kind of sanctifying for the sake of others is very important.</P><P>There was a mother with four sons. All of her four sons loved to drink and they almost exhausted the family's money. One day the mother told a preacher about this matter and he asked her, "Do you drink?" She said, "I always drink a little wine during each meal but never to the extent of getting drunk. My husband also drinks a little." The preacher said, "If you cannot give up your drinking, you should not expect your sons to give up theirs." Indeed, if parents have just a little craving, their children's craving will be many times stronger. If parents smoke cigarettes, the children will smoke opium. If parents watch movies, the children may possibly become movie stars.</P><P>The Lord wants His disciples to be sanctified. For this reason He sanctified Himself. He left a pattern for us to follow. We need to follow His footsteps. He did not need to be restricted, yet He was restricted. For the sake of His disciples, He sanctified Himself. Do you realize how much the Lord suffered and how much He was restricted when He was living with His disciples? He was tired more than His disciples. He was hungry more than His disciples. He needed rest more than His disciples. Yet He never left them except when He was alone on the mountain praying. He was the same as the disciples in everything. At the very end, His disciples could not point out any flaw in Him. All His disciples testified that He was without sin. Peter said that He was without blemish and spot, that no guile was found in His mouth, and that He committed no sin. Those who lived with Him knew His heart the best, and this was the testimony of one who had lived with Him.</P><P>The Lord is holy. But for the sake of His disciples, He sanctified Himself. We should also be the same at home, in school, and among the brothers and the sisters. God has put us here in order that we may be a shining light in darkness. We must pass through strippings and bondages. Otherwise, we cannot expect others to be sanctified. We must sanctify ourselves for the sake of others. Today we have seen the Lord and the excellency of His footsteps. Let us follow His footsteps.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 17: Notes on Scriptural Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 63</div><br></body></html>
