   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN BETWEEN THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible is thoroughly consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It starts with a man in front of two trees, the tree of knowledge and the tree of life Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eventually, in Romans we see that the tree of knowledge got into man's flesh, and the tree of life got into man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The two trees are within us Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The problem today is not whether you behave yourself ethically.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The problem is whether you go to the tree of knowledge or come to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Day by day do you live, walk, and have your being according to the flesh or according to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you do things according to the flesh, that means you are eating the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To set your mind upon the flesh is death Rom 8:6a .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Death is the issue, the result, of eating the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if you walk according to the spirit, you touch the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To set your mind upon the spirit is life v. 6b , and life is always the issue, the result, of eating the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to see that these two trees are within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are not in front of the two trees but in between them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Outwardly, we have the tree of knowledge in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Inwardly, we have the tree of life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now the whole situation depends upon whether we would go to the tree of knowledge or turn to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Would we walk, work, and have the church life according to the flesh or according to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we have the church life according to the flesh, the result will be death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then our church life will kill the saints because it is not according to the spirit but according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My burden is that we would see that Satan is in our flesh and Christ is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have an enemy in our flesh and a dear Savior in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Would we turn to our enemy and go along with him?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Would we coordinate with him or come to Christ and be one with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may say, "Surely, I will not go along with Satan but go along with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I know you would say this, but this is easy to say.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, we need a lot of defeats and failures which will force us to realize that there is no hope in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The flesh is good only to force you to turn to Christ in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some older saints may tell the young people that they need to learn the lesson of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But actually the young saints do not need the lesson of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They need the lesson of failures.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They need the lesson of losing their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This will make them desperate to turn to the Lord in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the older saints teach the younger ones to learn the lesson of patience, none of them will ever make it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one can graduate from this kind of school.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But after two years, many of the young ones will graduate from the school of failures.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some would say, "I give up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I can never make it in the brothers' house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I don't have that much patience."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I would say, "Hallelujah for your giving up."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have to give up and turn to the Lord in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our marriage life is also used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's purpose is to use your marriage life to force you to turn to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Without our spouse and our children, we could not gain Christ so much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The wives help the husbands to turn to Christ, and the husbands help the wives to turn to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Praise the Lord for the hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Praise the Lord for the defeats, the failures.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Praise the Lord for the many times we were trying to give up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord for the disappointments.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is because without all these negative things, we would never be forced to turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We would never be alert that we need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need Christ minute after minute.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to come back again and again to the spirit.</S>
