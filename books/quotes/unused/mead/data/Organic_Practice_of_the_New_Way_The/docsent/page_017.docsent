   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECOND STEP IN THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRAY-READING THE LORD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only do the New Testament saints call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even the ancient psalmists in the Old Testament called on the Lord as well.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>David said in Psalm 119:147, I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The crying here is to call by saying O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is also to pray and to speak to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To cry unto the Lord is to call on Him and to speak to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot call on Him without praying to Him, and we cannot say His name without speaking to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The longer we speak to the Lord, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The calling plus the speaking to the Lord is like a man s deep breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you speak out all that you have, you are breathing out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you take in the grace of the Lord, you are breathing in. We breathe out carbon dioxide, and we breathe in the oxygen from God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this cycle, spontaneously we are cleansed within, and our whole being becomes healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After this crying, David said that he hoped in thy word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In hoping in the Lord s word, it is better that we do not speak, lest we interrupt the Lord s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>David said again, Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word v. 148 . This shows us that in the experience of the Old Testament saints, there was the prayer, the hoping in the Lord s word, and the meditation on the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, for us, the New Testament believers, the quickest way to receive the Lord s word is not to meditate on His word; rather it is to pray-read His word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is easy for the mind to receive the Lord s word with its mental faculty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in pray-reading the Lord s word, there is the crying and the calling, and it will be spontaneous and natural to turn the Lord s word into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, you may have read Genesis 1:1 in the morning, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you consider these ten words, you may wonder what is the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The beginning is surely the start.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But it is the start of what?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For you to do this is to meditate on the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you would turn these ten words into pray-reading, you would say, Lord, in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without You there is no beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With You there is the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you speak to the Lord this way, your spirit will be full of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps you will say, Lord, may my wedding engagement have You as the beginning, and may my wedding have You as the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May my future home have You as the beginning, and may my childbearing also have You as the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Following that, you will pray-read, God created.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may say to the Lord, God, it is not by imagination or by illusion, but by creation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only You can create.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We cannot create.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The most we can do is but to manufacture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we have tasted the pray-reading, we will treasure every word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If I had the time, I could pray-read Genesis 1:1 for a whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more we pray, the tastier it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>O God, You have created the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot create the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today we can only enjoy the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have done too marvelous a work in creating the moon, the stars, and the sun in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only have You created the heavens; You have created the earth as well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All things on earth are created by You!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This kind of pray-reading will fully mingle the Lord s word with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It will give our spirit the greatest exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>LIVING ACCORDING TO THE MOVING OF THE SUN</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you have thoroughly pray-read the Lord s word in the morning, during the day this word will speak and work within you, and your spirit will spontaneously be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the evening, you will be filled with the Lord s word, and when you come into the meeting hall, you will spontaneously cry, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There will be no need for anyone to remind you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You will spontaneously stand up in the meeting to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The reason there is nothing to say in the meeting is that there is not enough pray-reading in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a saint has pray-read enough, he will surely have a lot to speak when he comes to the meetings, because there is too much to speak about.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The twenty-seven books of the New Testament alone provide us with enough to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we would call on the Lord and pray-read His word every morning, our whole being will be filled with the Lord s word spontaneously throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, our time in the morning is most precious.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is best for us to spend as little time as possible on other things and to spend this time instead on pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order to save time, when I am dressing in the morning, I begin to call on the Lord and pray-read His word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If your wife is not awake yet, you should not shout and cry aloud.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You can pray from within.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>While you are putting on your shirt, you can pray-read the verse you read yesterday: In the beginning...God... created...the heavens...and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>While you are washing up, you can also pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You can do two things at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Perhaps at the beginning you do not feel comfortable doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But after a while, you will feel comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you would spend half an hour or even fifty minutes there praying and reading the Lord s word, and finally mingling the praying with the reading, your spirit will be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>With such a morning, your whole being will have a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Christian revival does not occur in the afternoon or at sunset.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rather it occurs in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Christian life is not a sunset.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather it is a dawning of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In fact, we ourselves are the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Judges 5:31 says, Let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Proverbs 4:18 says, But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A Christian s life should be one that follows the moving of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When the sun rises, we should rise with it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We keep rising until the perfect day, which is noon.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Christian life does not have afternoons.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Whether we are among the worldly people, or in the church meetings, we should bring the shining light to others.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For this reason, it does not matter how busy we are, we have to spend some time to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In today s world, there is no one who is not busy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have to use our time just as we use our money.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There must first be a budget.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have to devote the first part of our time to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The first thing we do every morning when we rise up is to exercise our spirit, because today the Lord is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>For us to enjoy the Lord, to receive Him, to gain Him, and to experience Him is altogether a matter of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If our spirit is not functioning today, our relationship with the Lord is through.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>For this reason, every morning when we wake up, the first thing we must do is exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If circumstances permit, we have to take up the Bible and pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If it is inconvenient to do so, we have to pull out some verses from our memory and pray-read with them.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Whatever we do, we have to spend some time pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This way of exercise is like having a thorough bath from inside out in the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is like taking a spiritual shower; we are washed from head to toe in the Lord s word, and our whole being is fully refreshed.</S>
