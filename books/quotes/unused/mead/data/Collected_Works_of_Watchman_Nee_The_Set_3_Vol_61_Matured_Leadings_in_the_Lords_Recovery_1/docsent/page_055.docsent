   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>John Wesley's Example in Spending</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first year John Wesley served the Lord, his total spending was ninety-eight pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ten years later he was still spending ninety-eight pounds a year.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thirty years later it was still ninety-eight pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By the time of his death, he was still spending the same amount.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his latter years he was able to offer thousands of pounds every year.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He learned this habit from his early days when he spent less than a hundred pounds a year.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His heart was fully for the spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is our good pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sister Chan</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Among the items that you have handed over are seven skirts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is this not too much to give them all away?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you only have seven skirts, I hope that you would give away the one you most loved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is all you need to do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not wish to see you giving away too much.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Handing ourselves over is for the purpose that others will not be in want.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if that will leave us in want, then the time for handing over has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Saving Everything We Can for the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are the most generous people in the world because we can give away everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the same time, we are the most thrifty people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will not buy anything that we do not need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After we have offered up everything, we may be asked to take it back from the hand of the church, but the feeling should be completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Previously we were the master.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we belong to the Lord, and our money belongs to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We dare not randomly spend any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a servant uses his master's money carelessly, others will report to the master that he is wasting and squandering his master's money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Of course, all of us have different standards of living, but we should always do our best to save our money for the Lord and for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sister Nee</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I was young, I was full of cravings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I wished that I could possess everything in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But today this craving is gone, because the Lord has satisfied my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My taste towards the world has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Others are taking in the things of the world like hungry men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am taking them in like a filled man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is where the difference lies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul said to the Corinthians that those who use the things of the world should be as though they do not abuse them 1 Cor 7:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A Christian is not one who shuns the things of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, he uses them as though he is not abusing them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sister Yang</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the items on your list can be given away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let me say a word to the young brothers and sisters: You have to put a limit on your spending.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Spend only what you need to spend.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not waste anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you are making or knitting a dress, learn to make a few more and give away one or two of them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Never be negligent in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have to learn to say to yourself, "I am a servant of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My possessions should only be enough for my own use.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Anything that I have in excess I should give away."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Of course, you have to have your mother's permission.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please remember that today is the day you are making a vow before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If your parents do not approve of your vow, they can overturn it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Their silence, however, can be considered as their consent cf.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Num 30:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In addition to learning to hand over your all, you have to learn to submit to your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way you can give a good testimony to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brother Yu</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I read your list yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many young brothers and sisters loved the Lord very much when they were students, but when they started to work they became different.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In my youth in Fukien, sixty-six brothers and sisters were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Later, I corresponded with Mr. D. M. Panton.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In my first letter to him, he told me that Miss M. E. Barber had written to him and had told him that it would be a miracle if six out of the sixty-six remained after ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time I could not take this word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I thought that these sixty-six brothers and sisters were not ordinary people; they were the pride of their generation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today, when I count, I find that only four, not six, remain of the sixty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At that time we were all poor students, but we did our best to save.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By saving ten cents, we could print a hundred gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>By saving a dollar, we could print a thousand tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, in looking back, I can see that many of them were poor involuntarily; they were forced to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once they took up a job and earned some money, their thought turned to their own replenishment.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more they acquired things of this world, the more they wanted to acquire.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The more they took in the world, the more they wanted to take in. It is like an opium addiction; the more one takes, the more he is addicted.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the end he is unable to quit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You have to learn to consecrate yourself voluntarily from the bottom of your heart; no one should force you to do it.</S>
