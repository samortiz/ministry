   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The book of Habakkuk is one of the twelve minor books in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is very difficult to remember the order of these books in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But that day I opened the Bible to the very page where this verse concerning revival is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was a miracle for me to turn directly to this verse and point out the word "revive" to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This showed him that our practice was according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I had been in haste, I might have fully forgotten where the verse concerning revival is, and I might have turned to another place in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a testimony that "he who believes will not hasten away."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not forget that we are believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is our foundation, and this foundation has been tested.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is trustworthy, so we should put our trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not be in haste, in panic.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In my study of this portion of the Word, one reference book quoted a proverb which said that haste is of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we are in haste, in panic, we should not forget that this is of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not have to be in haste because we have Christ as a tested stone to be our foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This stone is also a precious cornerstone for the joint of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whereas the foundation stone holds the entire building, the cornerstone joins two parts of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The New Testament tells us, based upon Psalm 118:22-24, that Christ is the chief cornerstone Rom 9:33; Matt 21:42; Acts 4:11-12; Eph 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the New Testament, Christ as the cornerstone joins together the two walls, one of the Jewish believers and the other of the Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because Christ took the lead to join together the Jews and the Gentiles, He is the first cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even today we are not only held by Him as our foundation stone but also joined together by Him as our cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am joined to you, and you are joined to me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are joined together by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without Him, we are separate and detached.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today's Christianity is lacking in the experience of Christ as the joining cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to experience Christ as the tested, trustworthy stone to be the firmly established foundation holding us and the cornerstone joining us together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This issues in God's building, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This item of Christ has been fulfilled as a foretaste in today's age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Paul spoke of the righteousness of faith in Romans 9, he quoted Isaiah 28:16 by saying that whoever believes on this stone, Christ, will not be put to shame v. 33 . We can experience Christ as the stone today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is our cornerstone, our foundation stone, our tested stone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Him we trust.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The complete fulfillment of Christ as the stone will be in the next age, the age of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus' word to the Jewish leaders in Matthew 21:42 indicates that they were the builders, but they did not have the discernment to see that they were rejecting the cornerstone of God's building, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus quoted Psalm 118:22-23 by saying that the stone which the builders rejected was made the cornerstone by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Peter quoted the Lord's word in Acts 4:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 11 he mentioned Christ as the cornerstone, and in verse 12 he indicated that today this cornerstone is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Very few Christians know that Jesus Christ, their Savior, is the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our Savior, Jesus, saves us into God's building and joins us to God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the age of restoration, all these items of Christ will be completely fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Psalm 118:22-24 will definitely be fulfilled in the time of the restoration, because verse 26 of this psalm was quoted by the Lord in Matthew 23:38-39 when He told the Jews, "Behold, your house is left to you desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For I say to you, You shall by no means see Me henceforth until you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This will be the day of restoration at the Lord's second coming, when all the remnant of Israel will turn to believe in Christ and be saved Rom 11:23, 26 .</S>
