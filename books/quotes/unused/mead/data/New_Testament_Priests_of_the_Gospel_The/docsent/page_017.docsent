   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Those in the Old Testament</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Worshipping God in the Temple,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>but Those in the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Worshipping God in Christ the God-man</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Old Testament, man worshipped the God in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Old Testament age, when a man wanted to worship God, he had to go to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the New Testament worship is not in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, it is in Christ because God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today, although our God is the same as the one that the Jews worshipped, there is a difference in age, and there is also a difference in form.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The God that the Jews worshipped then was only God; He was not man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He had only divinity; there was no humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in the New Testament, the God that we Christians worship is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we worship God today, we are worshipping such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All who are not worshipping this God-man are not worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, God is an incarnated God, a God that is mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we worship Him, we are enjoying not only God, we are enjoying Man as well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the three and a half years when the Lord Jesus was fulfilling His ministry on earth, sometimes He was in Galilee, far away from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But sometimes He went to Jerusalem and was even found near the temple there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the temple, there were rows and rows of priests serving God properly and according to the regulations of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But Jesus was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps He was in a little cottage beside the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There we see a group of Galileans, some sitting and some standing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are even some tax collectors and harlots.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All these are lowly Galileans.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At this time, was God being worshipped in the temple, or was Jesus being worshipped?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do we go up to the temple, or do we go to a little cottage to worship God?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can see clearly that at that time, God was in that little house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is because Jesus was there, and God was inside Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The most difficult point we encounter when we preach the gospel to the Jews is that they still think that God is in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not believe that God is in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to tell the Jews that God left the temple two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today you cannot find God outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You must go to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you are in Christ, you will find God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the same principle, today when we worship God, we should not be attracted by beautiful cathedrals.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are seeking Christ, and we are worshipping Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We go to the place where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the New Testament worship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Originally, we were meeting in big meeting halls with pianos and dignified sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later, we were led to have home meetings and small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Four or five families now meet together in homes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some homes look alright.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But other homes are quite uncomely; the chairs are broken, the benches are crooked, and there is no separation between the kitchen and the dining room.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result, some brothers and sisters find such meetings impossible to take.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are not willing to come to this kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, we have to see that to worship God in the New Testament, we have to find where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not despise a place that appears ragged, for Jesus may be dwelling there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today, His name is not yet the glorified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His name today is called Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, we all have to see why we must change this old way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The old way suits our natural human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But in the Bible, God s ordained way matches His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For this reason, we must return to the New Testament and worship and serve according to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only then will we satisfy God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THE WAY TO WORSHIP IN THE NEW TESTAMENT Having No Form of Worship</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>With No Outward Set Program or Procedure</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Worship in the New Testament has no form.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If there is a form, it will easily become a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, until today, after we lead people to salvation, they still have the natural concept of attending worship services.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On Sunday, they will look for chapels nearby in order that they might attend services.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The beginning of a program is usually hymn singing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then the preacher offers his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After that, the pastor delivers his sermon and expounds the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the service is near its end, there is another hymn with prayer and benediction following.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to see that it is not wrong to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But it is absolutely wrong if we take the above way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A set program and procedure will fully kill the spirit within the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must never bring this way of worship service into the home meeting, small group meeting, or Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Its result is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have to change our concept completely so that we can have the New Testament worship.</S>
