<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM HSIEH TS'UN, WU HSING,<br>CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>Greetings to the brother in the Lord, Mr. Yueh Chiao:</P><P>Thank the Lord. He has blessed Hsieh Ts'un with the raising up of a meeting. We used to attend the Methodist denomination in Chien Li. We believed in the Lord for more than ten years, but we were foolish and ignorant, having never heard the gospel. Then Brother Huang Pao Kuang came to our area to preach the gospel, and Brother Chang Ching Yuan gradually introduced us to what he had read in The Present Testimony and Notes on Scriptural Messages and sometimes exchanged letters with us. It was only through this preaching of the gospel that we came to know the salvation of the cross of Christ and were led by the Holy Spirit to believe in the Lord and receive life. When Brother Huang Pao Kuang, whom we mentioned before, heard the truth about the church, he no longer had the peace to remain in his position, knowing that denominations were heresy (Gal. 5:20). Therefore, he announced that he was leaving the denomination and resigned from his post. The denomination also cut off the preacher's position in this place because of economic difficulties. Brother Huang took the opportunity to resign, but then later the brothers asked him to stay, so he rented a house to live in. He opened a school to teach and continued working for the Lord. All the saved brothers were willing to take the same way together. For this reason, the denominations began to oppose and give Brother Huang a hard time. Our brother saw this, but he knew the denominational error of human organization, so he was not willing to return to meet in the denominations. The denomination called a seasonal conference, and he did not go. They could not do anything about it, so they tried gentler methods to ask our brother to compromise. Our brother steadfastly refused. He still met according to the principle in Matthew 18:20. In the beginning of March of this year, two brothers, Chang Ching Yuan and Shen Hsi Chuan, came to our district to meet and pray in one accord with us. We each told the others how we were saved and the three brothers Chang Ching Yuan, Shen Hsi Chuan, and Huang Pao Kuang were witnesses.</P><P>Thank the Lord, the Holy Spirit worked so that we could be completely open before God without hiding anything. All the saved ones manifested the evidence of salvation in their words and actions. Those who were not saved were also manifested and could not hide. The more we know the Lord, the more we also know the corruption of our own flesh.</P><P>Then Brother Chang Ching Yuan spoke on the two great truths of baptism and breaking the bread. We heard it and received the light from 1 Corinthians 10 and 11 concerning the truth of the discerning of the Lord's Body and fellowship. So we each sent a letter to the denomination withdrawing from it. We also followed the apostles' teaching and fellowshipped, breaking bread and praying together. We have already established the Lord's table. Once the weather is warm, all the brothers will go into the water to be baptized. For this reason, I am sending this letter to you. My desire is that through your publication, Collection of Newsletters, all the brothers in the fellowship around the country will be made aware that the country town of Hsieh Ts'un in Chekiang province has a meeting in the Lord's name and will have fellowship with us. We send our blessings with this. Peace in the Lord!</P><P>The brothers meeting in Hsieh Ts'un,<br>Huang Pao Kuang, Ts'ang Ling Yu,<br>Chang Lung Sheng, and Lu Ying Shih<br>April 20, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM HUA SHE, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>(This letter was written to Mr. Hu Chi T'ang by Mr. Hu Chi Fu.)</P><P>Peace to my fourth younger brother:</P><P>I recently heard Brother Fan Hung mention that Brother Fei is going to gradually bring in the keeping of the Sabbath. He has planned to take steps to speak in each of the four meetings under him, slowly infusing the word Sabbath into everyone. I have recently heard that Brother Fei is closely fellowshipping with Brother Shang. Brother Fei accepted this suggestion because he really admires Brother Shang's knowledge of the Bible. For this reason, any brothers willing to come to the Hua She region to work should be very familiar with the Bible and should be able to completely understand the truths of the Bible. (They should be very familiar with the Sabbath.) This is the only way to bring Brother Fei back from being lost. The most important thing is to pray to the Lord to send His servants to join in the work. The house in Chou Chia Ch'iao changed landlords. The current owner only wants to occupy it himself and will not rent it out. We can only commit the pioneering work of that area into our prayer.</P><P>Your older brother,<br>Fu<br>March 15, 1934</P>
