<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class="title">A TALK WITH CO-WORKERS<br />FROM HONG KONG AND CANTON</h1><h1 class="title">(3)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:August 30, 1949<br />Place:Hong Kong</h1><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><p>Concerning the key issues related to the work, the first thing I would like to speak about is the coordination among the co-workers. First, the co-workers have to come together to pray much. Second, they have to spend time to study the Word together. Third, the co-workers should meet with the responsible brothers at least once a week to fellowship about the affairs related to the church.</p><p>In principle, the best way to have the bread-breaking meeting is by districts. The districts should come together once a month at the most.</p><p>If workers have a financial need, they should not look to man's hand. Perhaps they should look for a part-time job. This is what some people are practicing in the mainland today. At present, the government of the People's Republic has introduced the so-called "Common Policy." It points out four main classes of people: 1) small bourgeois, 2) farmers, 3) nationalistic bourgeois, and 4) workers. These four groups are combined together to run the government. This is the so-called "coalition government of the four classes." It is an imitation of the principle of having all things in common as described in Acts. There is no party and no special interest group. The whole nation is involved in production, and all the products go to the state.</p><p>In order to meet by districts, we have to look for suitable places. Once we find a suitable place, we can rent it. The church can rent the living room for meeting, while the brothers and sisters can rent the rooms for boarding. We can have prayer meetings, bread-breaking meetings, young people's edification meetings, and gospel meetings.</p><p>Due to the change in political conditions, there is an overabundance of civil workers and bureaucrats in Hong Kong. All of them do not work on the Lord's Day. Therefore, the best time for us to preach the gospel is on the Lord's Day. I strongly support using the Lord's Day morning as a time for preaching the gospel. This will deliver us from the habit of attending a so-called Sunday-morning service. Workers of the Lord should not be afraid of having too many people. Rather, our fear should be that the people will not come. If more people come, we can start a new meeting in another place.</p><p>The workers should have the proper concept that they are not professional preachers; they do not receive a regular salary. The Bible never says that God's workers should receive a salary from anyone. The church does not pay me to do the work of preaching. I am called by God, and I can only look to Him for His provision. This was Paul's way when he said, "If I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a stewardship" (1 Cor. 9:17).</p><p>The work of a worker is to fulfill the ministry he has received from God, and this ministry is always for the church. The church is not for the ministry; rather, the ministry is for the church. A worker should not work with the intention of bringing the church under the control of his ministry. On the contrary, a worker should serve under the church. Whether one is an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, a shepherd, or a teacher, all work is for perfecting others with the goal that all the brothers and sisters would be able to do what the gifted ones can do (Eph. 4:11-12). Today there are four thousand people who have turned to the Lord in Tsingtao. A few workers cannot possibly visit them all. Others must be perfected to do the job.</p><p>In Shanghai there are now over seven hundred brothers and sisters who are unemployed. Even at ordinary times there are two to three hundred unemployed ones. Perhaps the recent turbulence is actually an interim period that the Lord has provided for us to mobilize the unemployed ones to visit the new believers.</p><p>If we do not preach the gospel to those who are under eighteen years of age now, it will be hard to work on them after four years. The embryonic stage of the gospel in China was from 1918 to 1922. During this period, the Lord raised up many young lovers of Him in China. Most of them were under twenty years old. I was saved in 1920 at the age of seventeen. Four years later, I would have been in America for my studies. In preaching the gospel, we should not decide how old one should be before he can believe in the Lord. With the political situation changing by the minute, we have to be on the alert even more. The years of 1948 to 1952 may be another period of witnessing the Lord's revival. If we miss this time, it will be hard for us to make it up later.</p><p>In the Soviet Union the number of believers increased thirty times during the twelve years between 1918 and 1929. During the same time period, Russia's history became very turbulent. Similarly, I am asking you to do the seemingly impossible during this hour of trial. Throughout history, Christians have always been the ones who seized every opportunity to make gains for the Lord. They have always accomplished impossible tasks.</p><p>In the mainland, the People's Republic is discouraging gospel work. We are doing our best not to stir them up. We work quietly on people one by one. The Lord has placed the gospel work of China in our hands. If we work harder and stronger, sooner or later He will gain this land.</p><p>We should try our best to obey, labor, and work with our hands. We should pray much for wisdom from the Lord. Time is short. We do not know when we will lose our opportunity. Everywhere in Southeast Asia there are religious restrictions. British law in Singapore does not allow anyone to preach outdoors. Preaching the gospel in Malaysia is a criminal offense, with the government emphasizing its respect for the religious freedom of the Malaysians. We do not expect these governments to give us any help. Therefore, do not stir them up. We should not do anything to purposely demonstrate our zeal. Instead, exercise wisdom.</p><p>In east China, the number has multiplied a few fold in Nanking. Among all the provinces in China, Chekiang has the most promising work; the number of churches there is in the hundreds rather than in the tens.</p>
