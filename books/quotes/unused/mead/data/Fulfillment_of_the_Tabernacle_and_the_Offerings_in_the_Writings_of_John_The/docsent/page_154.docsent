   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN 7 Scripture Reading: John 14:7-15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue to consider the fourth sign in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John the sign of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE FATHER The Source, the Originator, the Initiator, the Planner, and the Designer</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Father is the source; He is the Originator, the Initiator, the Planner, and the Designer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to John 7:29, the Lord Jesus said, "I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This brief word indicates that the Father is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the source, the Father sent the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 13:3 also indicates that the Father is the source: "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands, and that He had come forth from God, and was going to God."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father is the Planner, and He sent the Son to carry out His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the Father is the Originator and the Initiator, the Son came forth from Him and received all from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Having the Will</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Godhead the Father is the One who has the will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 6:38 the Lord Jesus says, "I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In John 6:39-40 the Lord goes on to speak of the will of Him who sent Him and the will of His Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the Son of God, the Lord Jesus never did His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead, He always did the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was sent by the Father not to carry out His own will, but to carry out the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Son is one with the Father, and the Son's will is the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that the Father and the Son have just one will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not think that the Father has a will and the Son has another will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No, there is only one will, and this is the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Son came to accomplish the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Dwelling in Unapproachable Light</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Father dwells in unapproachable light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Concerning this point, 1 Timothy 6:16 says, "Who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor can see."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No one can approach the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, this unapproachable light is a burning fire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is impossible for anyone to approach such a light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sending the Son</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many verses in the Gospel of John speak of the Father's sending the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 4:34 the Lord Jesus says, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 5:24 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to 5:30, the Lord did not seek His own will, but the will of Him who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then in 5:36 the Lord says, "The works themselves which I do testify concerning Me that the Father has sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then in the next verse the Lord goes on to say, "The Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 6:38 the Lord says that He came down from heaven to do the will of Him who sent Him, and in verse 57 He says that the living Father sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 7:16 the Lord says, "My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same chapter the Lord says that the One who sent Him is true vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 13:20 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I shall send receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 14:24 the Lord says, "The word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to 15:21, the disciples will be persecuted because their persecutors do not know Him who sent the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 16:5 the Lord says, "Now I go to Him who sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In His prayer to the Father in chapter seventeen, the Lord also refers to the Father's sending Him into the world: "As You have sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world" v. 18 . Elsewhere in this prayer the Lord indicates that the disciples believe that the Father sent the Son v. 8 . If we study these verses, plus others in the Gospel of John, we shall learn why, how, and when the Father sent the Son.</S>
