The Overcomers</H2><P>This conquering seed also makes us overcomers. We are the co-overcomers with Christ because we have the over-coming seed within us. In Romans 16:20 we have the promise that God will soon crush Satan under our feet. Nevertheless, as co-overcomers with Christ, we are attacked and accused by the serpent (2 Cor. 12:7; Rev. 12:10). The serpent will also try to devour us (Rev. 12:4), but we can overcome him. We do not overcome by our merit; we overcome by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of our testimony (Rev. 12:11). We must declare the word of our testimony, telling the serpent, "You have been bruised." We should not only preach the gospel to human beings, but must also declare to the serpent the facts regarding the conquering seed of the woman. If you are tempted to lose your temper, do not try to overcome it. Simply speak to Satan, "Satan, don't tempt me. Don't you know that you have been bruised?" Say this the next time Satan entices you to lose your temper. Do not pray, but remind the serpent that he has been bruised. Say to him, "Satan, read your Bible. Read Hebrews 2:14. I want to remind you that you have been destroyed." We overcome him by the word of our testimony, by declaring what Jesus has done. This is our victory. Moreover, the overcomers do not love their soulish life even to the death.</P><P>Eventually, we will be co-rulers with Christ, ruling over the nations with a rod of iron (Rev. 2:26-27). Revelation 2:26-27 is a quotation from Psalm 2, a prophecy concerning Christ that predicts His rule over the nations. However, the fulfillment of this prophecy concerns the overcomers. By this we can see that the Bible actually combines Christ and all His overcomers as one body. This gives us further ground to say that the manchild in Revelation 12 is not only Christ Himself, but Christ as the Head and all the overcomers as His Body. In the prophecy of Psalm 2 Christ is prophesied as the One who will rule over the nations with a rod of iron. In the fulfillment in Revelation 2:26-27 the overcomers are revealed as the ones who will rule over the nations with a rod of iron. The prophecy and its fulfillment bring together Christ and His overcomers as one manchild. Therefore, Revelation 12:5 says that this manchild will rule all nations with a rod of iron. Hallelujah! We are co-rulers with Christ. According to Revelation 20:1-6, we will also be co-kings with Christ to rule with Him in the millennial kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE RESULT</H2><P>Now we come to the result. The seed is in Genesis 3:15, and the result, the harvest, is in Revelation 20 through 22. Each of the three items has grown from a seed into a highly developed form. The serpent has grown into a dragon (Rev. 12:9; 20:2), the individual woman has grown into a corporate woman, and the individual seed of the woman has grown into a corporate manchild.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Serpent to Be Cast<br>into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>Revelation 20:10 declares that the serpent ultimately will be cast into the lake of fire. This is the harvest of Satan. Satan's destiny and destination is the lake of fire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Woman to Issue in the New Jerusalem</H2><P>The woman herself will issue in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2, 9-10). This is the harvest of the woman. The destiny and destination of the woman is the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Seed of the Woman to Be the Center<br>of the New Jerusalem</H2><P>What about the seed of the woman? The seed of the woman will be the center of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:22-23; 22:1). This is the harvest of the seed of the woman. The destiny and destination of the seed of the woman is to be the center of the New Jerusalem.</P><P>I believe that the Lord has shown us clearly the serpent, the woman, and the seed of the woman. The seed of these three items is in Genesis 3:15, and the harvest of them all is in Revelation 20 through 22.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_133.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_135.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 134</div><br></body></html>
