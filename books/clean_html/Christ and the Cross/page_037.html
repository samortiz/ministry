<h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating All Things</h2>
<p>Due to Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and Adam&rsquo;s disobedience, all creation has been defiled and corrupted. As the representative of all creation, Satan was appointed to rule over the preadamic world. When he rebelled, everything that he ruled over and represented was defiled and corrupted. Not only was the earth and everything in it affected by his rebellion, even the heavens and everything in them were defiled and corrupted. Thus, all things needed to be terminated. As the representative of all creation after God&rsquo;s restoration of the universe, Adam was appointed to rule over all things on the earth (Gen. 1:26). When he disobeyed, everything that he ruled over and represented was defiled and corrupted (Rom. 5:12-19). Thus, the heavens and the earth and everything in them needed God&rsquo;s termination. Based on His foreknowledge, God determined to meet this need with the cross of Christ in His eternal plan. Hence, the cross of Christ terminated all things in the heavens and on the earth in the old creation in addition to the other negative things.</p>
<p>According to the revelation in the Bible, everything in the old heavens and old earth&mdash;the old creation&mdash;was terminated on the cross of Christ. When Christ died on the cross, He died there not only in and with humanity but also with all creation. Hence, Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross involved not only man&rsquo;s death but also the termination of all creation.</p>
<p>According to Matthew 27:51, when Christ died on the cross, &ldquo;the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom.&rdquo; Hebrews 10:20 says that this veil is Christ&rsquo;s flesh. Therefore, the splitting of the veil symbolizes the death of Christ&rsquo;s physical body. This veil was embroidered with cherubim (Exo. 26:31), and when it was split, the cherubim on the veil were split as well. According to Ezekiel, cherubim typify creatures (10:1-22; 1:5-14). The four living creatures in Revelation 4:6 and 7 are like cherubim in appearance (Ezek. 10:14-15; 1:5-10). With respect to having six wings (Rev. 4:8), they are also like the seraphim in Isaiah 6:2. We may say that the four living creatures, representing creation before God (Rev. 4:6-7), are cherubim plus seraphim. Hence, the veil with the cherubim typifies Christ with all creation. The splitting of the cherubim on the veil along with the veil itself typifies that all creation died together with Christ. The picture of the splitting of the veil with the cherubim indicates that when Christ died, all creation died with Him. Hence, Christ&rsquo;s death terminated everything of creation.</p>
<p>The death of Christ is an all-inclusive death. In order to accomplish this all-inclusive death, Christ had to be joined with all things through incarnation. His being joined with all things enabled Him, positively, to give God&rsquo;s uncreated life to the created man and, negatively, to terminate all creation. He became flesh to be joined with all things in order to give God&rsquo;s uncreated life to the created man and to terminate all creation through His death.</p>
<p>Man is the head and representative of all creation on earth, and by being joined to man, Christ was joined with all creation, as represented by man. Strictly speaking, Christ was joined to man; generally speaking, He was joined to all creation. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation was God&rsquo;s entering into creation to be joined with creation. When Christ put on humanity, He put on all creation. Just as the veil in the temple had cherubim on it, Christ had creation on Him. Just as Adam represented the entire human race and bore all of creation, as indicated by Genesis 1 and Romans 5, Christ was joined to man and bore everything of creation. All things were joined to and borne by the incarnated Christ. In a sense, Bethlehem, the place of incarnation, is representative of the universe, and Jesus the Nazarene is representative of all things. He entered into the universe and put on all things; all things are in Him. Therefore, His death was the death of all things. Everything borne by Him was included in His death. He took all things to the cross to die with Him. Therefore, the death of Christ was an all-inclusive death.</p>
<p>Although the death of Christ is extensive, people have limited views of His death. To a person who does not know God&rsquo;s salvation, Jesus was merely a Jew who died on a cross. To a new believer, Jesus died on the cross as a Substitute for our sins in order to be our Savior. To a believer who has some growth in the divine life, Jesus also destroyed Satan and terminated his angels, the world, the flesh, the old man, and the self on the cross. However, to a believer with even more growth, Jesus terminated all things on the cross. Jesus died on the cross as both God and man, as both Creator and creature, and as both man and all creation. He dealt with sins, the flesh, the old man, Satan, the world under Satan, and all the corrupted angels, demons, and evil spirits. All these things died on the cross. Everything that was not God died on the cross. Thus, Christ&rsquo;s terminating death on the cross was an all-inclusive death.</p>
<p>May we truly see Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive death on the cross. All things were terminated on the cross of Christ. Everything contrary to God, incompatible with God, in opposition to God, offensive to God, and not of God, whether Satan, demons, sin, the world, the flesh, the old man, the self, or all creation, was terminated on the cross. Everything of Satan and the world, everything of sin and the flesh, and everything that belonged to them and to all creation, whether good or bad, were terminated on the cross. The cross of Christ is a great termination, a great clearing up. Everything that God does not want was terminated there.</p>
