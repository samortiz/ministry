[1]  THE REVELATION OF THE TABERNACLE Scripture Reading: Exo 31:12-17
[2]  Exodus 25:1 31:11 contains the revelation of God to Moses concerning all the matters of the tabernacle and His service.
[3]  The result of God s work, especially in redemption, is Christ Himself.
[4]  Christ is the Sabbath, and the Sabbath day typifies Christ.
[5]  God can only rest and be refreshed in Christ, with Christ, and with the redeemed ones.
[6]  Enjoy Christ and rest and refresh yourself with God, in Christ and with Christ, in His all-inclusive work.
[7]  OF THE TENT AND THE CAMP Scripture Reading: Exo 33:1-11; Heb 13:13 THE TESTIMONY OF GOD
[8]  Any of the Jewish people who would have the presence of the Lord and who would have the fellowship with the Lord had to leave Judaism, that is, go out of the camp unto Jesus, who was the real tabernacle with the presence of God and the fellowship with God.
[9]  Hebrews 13:13 says, Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.
[10]  What the people of Israel were to build up was a tent, which was, on the one hand, the dwelling place of God, and on the other hand, a place, a center, where they could meet together before God and with God.
[11]  Exodus 35 speaks of the different materials offered by the people of God for the building of the tabernacle.
[12]  All these materials offered by the people of Israel represent the things of Christ which were experienced by the people of God.
[13]  Furthermore, fine linen represents the righteousness of God which is Christ Himself, the goats hair represents Christ enduring the judgment of God, and the porpoise skins represent Christ as the power to endure the sufferings of human life.
[14]  These items will be gradually wrought into us by the Holy Spirit and woven into our life, that we may offer them to God as materials to build up the fellowship between God and His people for the Lord s service.
[15]  The third category of the offerings is the silver and bronze 35:5, 24a .
[16]  Silver represents the redemption of the cross, while bronze represents the judgment and the testing of God and even the trials from the enemy.
[17]  We have to experience the redemption, the cross of Christ, and we have to experience the judgment and testing which Christ endured and suffered.
[18]  The building of the church, the building up of the service of God, and the building up of the fellowship between the Lord s children and the Lord Himself must be with the Christ experienced and possessed by us to be our wealth.
[19]  Exodus 35 and 36 reveal to us the materials and the workmanship of the building of God.
[20]  By this we know that for the building of the Lord both the material and the workmanship must be something of Christ which we experience.
[21]  This ascended Christ is the heave offering, and all the people of God offered something of this ascended Christ for the building of God.
[22]  AND THE WAVE OFFERING The Wave Offering of Gold
[23]  As long as we are regenerated by Christ, we have the divine nature and the divine life of God 2 Pet 1:4; John 3:15-16 .
[24]  The first category of materials is the articles made of gold v. 22 . As we have seen, this category represents the experiences of the divine nature of Christ.
[25]  We must labor by the Holy Spirit to experience Christ as our righteousness, the heavenliness of Christ, the kingship of Christ, and the redemption of Christ.
[26]  We should not view the heavenliness of Christ, the kingship of Christ, the authority of Christ, the redemption of Christ, or Christ as our righteousness in an objective way.
[27]  All the materials offered by the people for the building of the tabernacle typify something of Christ experienced by us.
[28]  As we shall see, the workmanship for God s building is also Christ Himself experienced by us.
[29]  We need to know how to embroider with the heavenliness of Christ, with the kingship, the authority, of Christ, with the redemption of Christ, and with Christ as our righteousness.
[30]  Sometimes we need to know how to spin with the heavenliness of Christ, the authority of Christ, or with the redemption of Christ, and sometimes we need to know how to weave with Christ as our righteousness.
[31]  CHAPTER SIX THE COVERING OF THE TABERNACLE Scripture Reading: Exo 36:8-19
[32]  The second layer of the covering of the tabernacle was made of goats hair Exo 36:14 .
[33]  The first layer signifies Christ as the One who knew no sin, the righteous One and our righteousness before God, but the second layer signifies that in the eyes of God, when Christ was on the cross, He became sin for us.
[34]  Because the tabernacle was built not with one board but with forty-eight boards joined together, it also signifies the church as the dwelling place of God, composed of many believers who have been joined together Eph 2:21-22 .
[35]  The Ark is composed of acacia wood, signifying the human nature of Christ, overlaid with gold, signifying the divine nature of Christ.
[36]  On the south side of the tabernacle there were twenty boards 36:23 , and on the north side there were twenty more v. 25 . There were two sets of twenty, again signifying a testimony.
[37]  OF THE TABERNACLE Scripture Reading: Exo 36:31-38; 37:1-9; Gal 2:9; Rev 3:12; John 10:9
[38]  The fourth point with which we must be deeply impressed is related to the two tenons under each board v. 22 . There are always two sides, two aspects, to the things created by God.
[39]  The entire tabernacle was covered by a fourfold covering, which represents the fourfold Christ 36:8-19 .
[40]  This means that even though the church is grounded on the redemption of Christ, it still has to be covered by Christ, not by a simple Christ but by a fourfold Christ.
[41]  CHAPTER NINE THE CONTENTS OF THE TABERNACLE 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 37:10-29 THREE ASPECTS OF CHRIST
[42]  Chapter 37 of Exodus is a record of the building of the contents of the tabernacle.
[43]  The table of the bread of the Presence represents Christ as our life supply John 6:33-35, 51 , the lampstand represents Christ as our light John 1:4; 8:12 , and the altar of incense represents Christ as the sweet savor for us toward God Eph 5:2 .
[44]  When we truly experience Christ as life to us, we are in the light of life, and when we are in the light of life, we share and experience Christ as the sweet savor to God.
[45]  There is only place for Christ Christ as our life, Christ as our light, and Christ as our sweet savor to God.
[46]  No measurement is given for the size of the lampstand, signifying that there is no measurement for the light.
[47]  Although there is no measurement for the lampstand, there are many occurrences of the number three in the description of the lampstand.
[48]  Exodus 37:2 says of the Ark, And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside.
[49]  Christ not only manifests God Himself outwardly, but what is within Christ is also God Himself.
[50]  Both what Christ manifested without and what Christ is within are God Himself.
[51]  Without the covering and without the shedding of blood to redeem us from our sins, the testimony of God, which is Christ Himself to testify what God is and to show us what we are, would be a condemnation to us.
[52]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY OF GOD Scripture Reading: Exo 38:21-31
[53]  Exodus 38:21 says, This is the sum of the things for the tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the Testimony.
[54]  The tabernacle is the enlargement of the Ark. In size there was a difference, but in principle and in nature the tabernacle was the same as the Ark. The purpose of the church is to express God in the same way that Christ expresses God.
[55]  Christ is the testimony of God because with Him there is the definition, the explanation, and the expression of God.
[56]  The reason that the church could be the testimony of God in Christ is because the church is full of Christ as the Ark, the incense altar, the table of the bread of the Presence, and the lampstand.
[57]  Exodus 38:24 through 31 mentions first the gold, then the silver, and finally the bronze.
[58]  The more we experience the tests and the trials which Christ suffered, and the more we experience the redemption which Christ accomplished, the more we will have something for the foundation of the building of the church.
[59]  We must have all the experiences of the suffering of Christ and of the redemption accomplished by Christ as the foundation for the building of the church, and we must also have the experience of God s nature as the manifestation of what God is.
[60]  The holy garments with the shoulder pieces and the breastplate of gold and precious stones signify the fellowship of the Body of Christ brought in through the priestly ministry.
[61]  By this fellowship the Lord s people can minister to the Lord and minister to His people, and by this fellowship the mind, the thought, and the will of God concerning His people are revealed.
[62]  First Peter 2:5 says, You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[63]  Exodus 39:24-26 says, And they made on the hem of the robe pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet strands, twined.
[64]  At the hem of the robe of the garments there were the pomegranates and the golden bells, showing that with the fellowship of the Body of Christ there are always the riches and the beauty of life with the voices, with the words, as the messages of the testimony of God.
[65]  Exodus 39:32-43, as a conclusion to chapters 35 through 39, is a record of all the things made by the people of Israel for the tabernacle.
[66]  In these verses and in chapter 40, two different terms are used for God s building: the tabernacle and the Tent of Meeting.
