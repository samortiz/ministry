IN THE LORD&rsquo;S SPREADING TO THE WHOLE EARTH</h2>
<p>The Lord is responsible for the spread of His work; it is not us. We are nothing. Even if we earned ten academic degrees, we would not be able to spread the recovery to all five continents. However, we receive letters from all over the world that were written by people inviting us to visit them. Recently, the brothers in South Korea have reminded us to not forget them. If I worked in Europe, I would preach the word every week of the year. Furthermore, Australia and New Zealand are also open to us.</p>
<p>We should not be governed by our feelings, being happy only when we are given &ldquo;sweet soymilk&rdquo; and being sad when we are given &ldquo;hot and sour soup.&rdquo; Moreover, we should not expect that our service to the Lord will ensure that we have no problems or have a successful career. I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s work for many years, and I have encountered many problems. I have taken this way whether people commended me or criticized me. The church is the church. We cannot say that the church is no longer the church when a cold wind blows, or that the church is the church when a warm wind blows. In fact, when a cold wind blows, the truth of the church is demonstrated even more. This work has been blessed by the Lord because it has never changed its course based on the direction of the wind.</p>
<p>I have been in the United States for over twenty years, but I have never changed my course. I am not afraid of opposition. I have been speaking for fifty-two years in many places on the earth, but I have not changed my way. We invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks to come to us. He was nearly twenty years my senior, and I greatly respected him. However, when I found out that he was incorrect in his stance toward the Lord&rsquo;s way, I told him that I could not take his way. Today, twenty years later, everything of his has been relegated to history. Not only is his ministry finished, but his way is no longer practiced. The Lord&rsquo;s way is the unique way. I am burdened that we all see this matter. I do not want to see the young people coming in today and leaving five years later, neither do I want you to be happy today and disappointed three years later. We must see this way.</p>
<p>Let us use marriage as an illustration. If you are getting married, you must first have a clear knowledge of the one whom you intend to marry. You must not get married foolishly only to divorce later. There is only one Lord, one church, one Body, one Spirit, and one life. Moreover, there is only one way and one fellowship. This is the unique testimony on the island of Taiwan as well as on the whole earth. The Lord has confirmed this. Wherever we go, whether to Africa, South America, or Australia, the testimony among the churches is that we are all in the same move. We have the same life, and we walk on the same way. If we fall into trouble on this way, we should humble ourselves and immediately make a turn, be adjusted, and stop struggling. If we continue our struggling and try to open another way, we will fail.</p>
<p>There is an example in the New Testament. Barnabas led Paul to the apostles in Jerusalem (Acts 9:27), but later, due to his sympathy for his cousin Mark, he separated from Paul (15:37-39). This was related to human affection. From then on, Barnabas is not mentioned in Acts. This is a solemn matter. He did not merely separate from Paul; he diverged from the Lord&rsquo;s way. If a person has a thought to leave, he must understand that he is not separating from us but from the Lord&rsquo;s way. Although he is still saved and a child of God, he will come to a dead end regarding his service to the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s way is only with His recovery. There is only one way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYTHING BEING FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In taking this way, we must learn not to be proud and not to have personal relationships with others. All the brothers and sisters are precious to us. We are members of the Body, and we should treat everyone equally without discrimination. I frequently contact brothers because of the literature work and because of the responsibility we share in the Lord&rsquo;s work. But my contact with them is not related to friendship. I do not have any personal bonds of friendship with anyone. Rather, my love is in the Body. Due to the limitation of time, I cannot contact you more often and have a more practical relationship with you. Some of you have written me letters, but I have no time to reply. If you want to receive a reply from me, it is best to write me a note as short as a telegram. It is not that I do not want to read your letters; rather, it is that I do not have the time. Moreover, due to my poor eyesight, I must wait for helpers to read to me.</p>
<p>I love all of you, but I do not have special affection for any of you. I hope that everyone would be like this. Even if you come from the same locality and stay in the same sisters&rsquo; house or brothers&rsquo; house, you should not consider yourselves as a special group or be distinct from other brothers and sisters. Neither should you have a special feeling toward your locality. Although we cannot be completely void of a special feeling, we should always remember that our work is not for a specific locality. Our work is for the Body of Christ. The fruit of our work is not merely for one local church. The fruit of our work is for the churches throughout the earth.</p>
<p>When you go abroad, you will see that the result of the Lord&rsquo;s work in Taiwan, whether in Taipei, Taoyuan, or Taichung, affects the United States. Therefore, you should thank and praise the Lord if you are in Taoyuan today, and you should thank and praise the Lord if you are in Taichung tomorrow. Everything is for the Lord&rsquo;s church, for the family of God. Therefore, whether you are in Taoyuan or Taichung, it is the same; there is no difference. This is a crucial point. Sometimes when we discuss the needs in one locality, the brothers and sisters from that locality speak for their locality. When we discuss the needs in another locality, the brothers and sisters from that locality speak for their locality. It would be beautiful if the brothers and sisters from Hualien spoke for Taichung, not for Hualien, and those from Taichung spoke for Taipei, those from Taipei spoke for Anaheim, those from Anaheim spoke for South Africa, and those from South Africa spoke for Kaohsiung.</p>
<p>We are not here for our own work nor for the church in our own locality. We are here for the Body of Christ. May we be willing to learn this and always remember it. Then we will be preserved to walk this way for our whole life, and we will not have any problems.</p>
<p>In the church we should never be puffed up on behalf of one or be against another. This is like considering Apollos to be higher than Paul or considering Paul to be higher than Cephas. We are all the same. The least among the saints can supply us, and the greatest among the saints can also supply us. Everything is the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement. We should thank the Lord when He gives us a saint who functions like a big arm. We should thank Him when He gives us a saint who is like a small finger. We should treat everyone alike, without distinction, whether they are weighty, light, high, or low. If your gift is great, you are our brother. If your gift is small, you are still our brother. If you are seemingly not gifted, you are all the more our brother. In this way we will be preserved from many problems. Furthermore, we should never say that we can work with certain ones but not with others. We should be able to work with anyone without expressing our choice. There are always problems when we express our choice.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_078.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_080.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord's Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service &nbsp; pg 79</div><br></body></html>
