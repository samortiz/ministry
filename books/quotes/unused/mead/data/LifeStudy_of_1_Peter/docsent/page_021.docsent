   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Maturing in the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the progressing stage of salvation God is also causing us to grow in His life 1 Cor 3:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is transforming us by renewing the inward parts of our soul by the life-giving Spirit 2 Cor 3:6, 17-18; Rom 12:2; Eph 4:23 through the working of all things Rom 8:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is building us together into a spiritual house for His dwelling 1 Pet 2:5; Eph 2:22 , and He is maturing us in His life Rev 14:15 for the completion of His full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the first stage of God s salvation we are saved from God s condemnation and from eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in the second stage we are being delivered from the power of sin, the world, the flesh, the self, the soul the natural life , and individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, in this stage we are in the process of being delivered from so many negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The goal of this deliverance is that we would have maturity in the divine life for the fulfilling of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE STAGE OF CONSUMMATION</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The third stage of God s full salvation, the completing stage, is the stage of consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This stage is composed of the redemption transfiguration of our body, conformity to the Lord, glorification, inheritance of God s kingdom, participation in Christ s kingship, and the topmost enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These matters are beyond our present experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They will be revealed to us in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we have experienced the first stage of salvation and are now in the second stage, the third stage is still far beyond us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The items in this stage will be revealed at the unveiling of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Transfiguration of Our Body</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the completing stage of salvation, God will redeem our fallen and corrupted body Rom 8:23 by transfiguring it into the body of Christ s glory Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He will conform us to the glorious image of His firstborn Son Rom 8:29 , making us holy and absolutely like Him in our regenerated spirit, transformed soul, and transfigured body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will also glorify us Rom 8:30 , immersing us in His glory Heb 2:10 that we may enter into His heavenly kingdom 2 Tim 4:18; 2 Pet 1:11 , into which He has called us 1 Thes 2:12 , and inherit it as the topmost portion of His blessing James 2:5; Gal 5:21 , even to reign with Christ, to be His co-kings, participating in His kingship over the nations 2 Tim 2:12; Rev 20:4, 6; 2:26-27; 12:5 and sharing His royal, kingly joy in His divine government Matt 25:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our body will be freed from the slavery of corruption of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of God s new creation Rom 8:21 , and our soul will be delivered out of the realm of trials and sufferings 1 Pet 1:6; 4:12; 3:14; 5:9 into a new realm, full of glory 4:13; 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this new realm we shall share and enjoy all the Triune God is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Realm of Suffering</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>and the Realm of Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Recently some brothers said to me, Brother, in this country we enjoy all manner of riches, but the saints in other places are poor and they are suffering many things, including persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This does not seem fair.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While they are suffering so much, we are here in this country enjoying good things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I replied, The saints in other countries are suffering their own kind of trials, whereas we in the United States are suffering in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I was in China, I didn t suffer the kind of things I am suffering now.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not think that because we may have an abundance of material things we do not have sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Americans suffer from heart disease, ulcers, and mental illness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this country we may suffer in one way, whereas those in other countries may suffer in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Wherever we may be, we shall suffer and be subject to God s discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no way for us to avoid suffering in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To live on earth as a human being is to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The earth today is not for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The young people may expect to finish their education, find a good job, and then have a very pleasant married life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They need to realize, however, that on this earth there is no paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must wait for the Lord s coming to be saved from the realm of suffering into a realm of comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That will be the full salvation of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can testify that although I have a good wife and although I am loved by the saints and the churches, I continue to suffer a great deal in my soul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one can help me to avoid this suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, I am waiting for the unveiling of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the time of His coming back, I shall be rescued from this realm of suffering into a realm of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In that realm we shall have the full enjoyment of the Triune God and of all that He is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the salvation of our souls that is ready to be revealed to us at the last time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is also the grace that will be brought to us at the unveiling of Christ in glory 1:13; Matt 16:27; 25:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, this is the end of our faith 1 Pet 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The power of God is able to guard us unto this that we may obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we should eagerly expect such a marvelous salvation Rom 8:23 , and we should prepare ourselves for its splendid revelation Rom 8:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hallelujah for the full salvation of the Triune God in its three stages!</S>
