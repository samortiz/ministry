   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FURTHER WORD CONCERNING GODLINESS Leading a Life in All Godliness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Godliness is God manifested in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Timothy 2:2 says that we need to lead a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The kind of pictures we hang in our bedroom may indicate whether or not we care for godliness in our private life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The pictures we choose may manifest God to others, or they may manifest something else.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can apply the same principle to hundreds of things in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For instance, going to a movie does not manifest God to others; rather, it produces questions in others about our character.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, going to a bar, even if it is to preach the gospel, will not give others an impression of godliness; rather, it will cause us to lose our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not merely an outward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we kneel down to pray in our bedroom while a certain kind of picture is hanging on the wall, we may immediately have a sense to rise up and throw it away.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no need for anyone to tell us to take it down.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the Triune God has been dispensed into us in His economy, we may have a sense from within that He is not happy as long as that picture is hanging on our wall.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is godliness, not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, if we go to a bar, the next morning we will have difficulty praying because the Triune God who has been dispensed into us does not agree with our going to a bar.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not an outward regulation but an inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As children of God, regardless of our age or status, we all have the reality of the Triune God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a brother tries to speak the word of God while wearing a showy tie, he may lose the anointing of the Spirit within, and the saints who are listening to him may be distracted by the tie.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wearing such a tie, therefore, cannot be godliness, God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are not insignificant matters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>My burden is not to give regulations concerning the kind of ties we should wear or concerning anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, we need to see that whatever we do, whatever we are, and whatever we wear should give others an impression of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Another practical area in which we should lead a life in all godliness is our conversations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The words out of our mouth should give others the impression of God being manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not allow loose talk and gossip to come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must exercise our spirit to reject such talk, which does not bear any impression of God being manifested in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even in the small things, we need to lead a life in all godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When deciding whether or not to buy a certain pair of shoes, we should not consider the style first.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, we need to consider whether God could be manifested in this pair of shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is my practice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we choose the hairstyle of a movie star, when others see us, they will be impressed with the movie star, not with God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our hairstyle should give others the impression of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we choose a worldly hairstyle, we will not have any impact on the barber if we try to preach the gospel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a barber proposes a new worldly hairstyle to a young brother, but the young brother asks instead for a common hairstyle, the barber may ask why he has made this choice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the brother s testimony opens up a way for him to say a few words concerning the Lord Jesus and gives impact to what he says.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The barber may initially argue with him, but something will impress the barber within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps he will wake up that night and consider the testimony of the young brother.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Holy Spirit will then speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the proper way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not merely preach the gospel; we live it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As branches of Christ, we live the vine and grow the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We preach the gospel by our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to lead a life in all godliness, not only in certain things, such as coming to the meetings, singing, praising, and testifying, but everywhere and in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A famous Christian minister in the late 1800s once purchased and moved into a new house.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once he had arranged everything and decorated the house, he invited his father to come to see his new house.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After his father had looked in every room, he said that everything was nice but that he did not see anything indicating that the house s owner was a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What we display in our home should strongly impress others with godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Godliness is not merely an outward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The word manifested in 1 Timothy 3:16 indicates that godliness is an inward life with an outward expression.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order for God to be manifested in the flesh, godliness needs to be expressed in our whole living.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whatever we say, express, do, and wear should give an impression of God being manifested in us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we practice to lead a life in all godliness, we will not go to certain places or attend certain events.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Godliness would not allow us to touch unclean things; rather, godliness will separate us from all ungodly things.</S>
