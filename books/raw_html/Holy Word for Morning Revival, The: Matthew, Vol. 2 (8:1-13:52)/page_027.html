<p class="bold">WEEK 9 — DAY 5</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">Matt. 13:19 &nbsp;When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart.…</p><p class="bold">23 &nbsp;But the one sown on the good earth, this is he who hears the word and understands, who by all means bears fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold.</p><p class="bold">Ezek. 36:26 &nbsp;I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</p><p>Matt. 5:3 &nbsp;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p class="bold">8 &nbsp;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In this [first] parable, [the parable of the sower], we see that…the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens is absolutely a matter of growth in life.…The kingdom is not established by outward working, but by inward growing.…Because many Christian workers have not seen this, they still think that the church is built up by work and labor. But the church can be produced only by sowing Christ as the seed into humanity.…If we see this vision, we would no longer trust in what we do because we would know that the kingdom is a matter of life, that the church is a matter of growth in the life seed sown into our humanity.…Those who have been with us for a number of years can testify that I do not teach others what they should do. I do not give them instructions regarding their behavior. But in meeting after meeting, conference after conference, and training after training, I have ministered Christ as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. It has always been a matter of Christ, life, the Spirit, and the church.</p> <p>The young people who are burdened for the campuses must see this vision. Young people, if you go to the campuses to do a work, that will mean nothing. You should not go there to work, but to sow the seed, to be a sower. During the years I was with Brother Nee in China, I saw that he was not working; he was sowing Christ as a seed. He told me that Miss M. E. Barber did not come to China to work. She was in China sowing Christ, even sowing herself in Christ. She was a seed sown into that district in China. Eventually, something grew out of that seed. The Lord’s recovery today is the produce of the seed sown by Sister Barber and Brother Nee.</p><p>According to this parable and the Lord’s own interpretation of it, this seed is sown into our heart (v. 19). In the past we have pointed out that our heart is not the receiving organ but the loving organ, and that our receiving organ is our spirit. We say this based upon Ezekiel 36, where God promises to give us a new spirit and a new heart, a new spirit to receive God and a new heart to love Him.…In 1 Peter 3:4 our spirit is called the inner man of our heart. This indicates that our spirit is surrounded by our heart.… When we believed in the Lord Jesus…we opened our heart. The result, however, was that He came into our spirit. When we opened our heart to believe in Him, He came into our spirit. But our spirit is not the soil for growing Christ. The soil is our heart. This parable makes it perfectly clear that our heart is…the earth, the very place where the seed is sown and where it grows.</p><p>The parable of the sower seems very simple, but it is actually deep and profound. It exposes the real condition of our heart in the presence of the heavenly King. Whatever is in us is exposed.…As long as you are either the wayside, the soil with hidden rocks, or the soil with thorns, the kingdom cannot grow in you. [But]…the good earth signifies the good heart…that grows Christ….The kingdom and the church are growing here.
