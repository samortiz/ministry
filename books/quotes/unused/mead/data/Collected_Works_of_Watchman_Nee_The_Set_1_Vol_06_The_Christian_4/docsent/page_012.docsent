   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>On that night the Israelites used hyssop to dip in the blood and strike on the upper doorpost.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you want to rely on the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, you must have your own hyssop.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the Scripture, hyssop is the smallest of all plants 1 Kings 4:33 and is despised by men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaking truthfully, I have never seen a proud man who can believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Unless we see ourselves as sinners and are willing to stand in the position of a sinner, we will not receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, you who are proud, please do not be proud any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Humble yourself before the feet of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Confess that you are a sinner; accept His salvation, and you will be saved!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the blood was still in the basin, the Israelites were not safe; when the blood was applied, they were safe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If anyone knows about the salvation of the Lord Jesus but does not accept Him with faith, he is in danger.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the moment his heart is cleansed by the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, he is secure forevermore.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What a pity that so many who have believed in the Lord Jesus do not know that they are secure and will not come into judgment!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Have you believed in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Have you been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many Christians answer "yes" to the first question, but concerning the second question, I am afraid that many answer, "I don't know," "I dare not say," or, "I hope I can be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These answers are not correct because the Bible says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved" Acts 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you believe in the Lord Jesus, then you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How can you believe in the Lord Jesus and yet not be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are not saved, even if you have believed in the Lord Jesus, then has not the Word of God become void?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this is the case, then the Lord is a liar!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible says, "This is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son...And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God...He who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son" 1 John 5:9, 11-13, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The teaching of the Scripture is this: He who believes in the Lord Jesus has the Lord Jesus, and he who has Him has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who have read this testimony of God can know that they have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man does not believe that God has given us eternal life and does not believe that he who has the Son of God has life, he has made God a liar!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not make God a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said that we can be saved by believing, and that if we have His Son, we have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since we have believed and received His Son, the Lord Jesus, as our Savior, surely we are already saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word of the Scripture says that we can know whether we have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I once went to a certain place to preach, and I asked those who truly believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior to raise their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nearly everyone put up a hand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then I asked those who were sure that they had been saved to raise their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not one hand was raised!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My visits to other places also led to the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are many who believe in the Lord Jesus, but there are few who know that they are saved!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After I read the Bible, I could not understand how people could believe in the Lord Jesus and yet not know that they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible definitely says that those who believe in the Lord Jesus have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How can we believe in Him and yet not be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God cannot lie.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To entertain such a thought is blasphemous enough; how much more serious is it to openly doubt His Word!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He said that if we believe we have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We believe, and we surely have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"He who believes into the Son has eternal life" John 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let us consider the condition of another household in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose we went to a third house, and the moment we reached the door, we saw the upper doorpost and side posts smeared with the blood of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we entered into the house, we saw the killed lamb and the basin with hyssop by its side.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, the people in the house were sitting and crying, with their firstborn also looking pale, crying, and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They acted as if a great calamity was going to come upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If I asked them, "Why are you so sad?", they would answer, "Sir, don't you know about the calamity that will befall us at midnight?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At that time God will kill all the firstborn in Egypt, and our son will be among them."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then they might cry again.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But I would ask them, "Has God not established a way of salvation for you?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Did He not order you to kill the lamb and smear the blood on the upper doorpost and side posts?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Is your door not smeared with blood already?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Why are you still worrying?"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They might answer, "Yes, God has indeed said this, and we have done so accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But we don't feel that we are safe."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then I would do my best to persuade them not to worry and cry because they have the precious blood, and they are in a safe and sound position.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Despite my efforts, they may continue to worry over the thought that it is impossible to know they are safe just by the smearing of the blood on the upper doorpost.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Is it reasonable for this household to be so worried?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yes or no?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You might laugh at their foolishness because once the blood was on their upper doorpost, everything was all right.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Continuing to worry and suffer would merely be self-inflicted agony.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But many times we are the same as they.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Having believed in the Lord Jesus, having accepted Him as our personal Savior, and having applied His precious blood on the upper doorpost of our heart, we have entered into a safe and sound position.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are saved and will no longer perish!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What more do we fear?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Why do we still worry?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The moment we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were safe.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we have not accepted the Lord Jesus as our Savior, then we ought to worry and cry for we are condemned already John 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If, however, we have believed in the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, then we have no reason or right to worry and cry, because we are already saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We ought to rejoice because God has already saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have not saved ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What a wonderful grace!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We ought to start praising the grace of the Lord and worry no more.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life" John 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, we are already saved!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Heaven is guaranteed to us!</S>
