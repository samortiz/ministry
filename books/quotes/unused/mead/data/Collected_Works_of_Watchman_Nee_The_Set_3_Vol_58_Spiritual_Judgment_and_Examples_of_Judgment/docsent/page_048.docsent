   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Accepting the Dealing of the Cross Willingly</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our brother's testimony shows us that he suffered through his father's death and the loss of family fortune.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If our brother considers all these to be crosses from God and accepts them willingly, they will become life to him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Otherwise, they will become death to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If your experience is merely a shame to you, this shame will bring in death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if it is a cross which you take up for the Lord, the mark which is left behind will be life to you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you only revile me, I only need to allow you to revile.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if you strike my right cheek, then it becomes a matter of the cross: Will I allow you to strike my left cheek as well?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I turn my left cheek to you, considering it God's sovereignty for me to suffer, and I suffer willingly, I have peace and joy in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this case I am accepting the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, my psychology may be affected after I am struck; I may become combative or closed toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My mind may become set against others, and I may hate them or feel unjustly treated by them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are all human wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They can never become part of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They should all be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A woman may love her husband very much.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After her husband dies, she may become a very sullen person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If she believes in the Lord and still holds on to these sullen feelings, she is clearly wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She should learn the lesson of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If she does not, she will become hard, cold, and even bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should learn to be pliable and meek and accept the crosses that God has arranged for us so that we can reap life and spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we do, these crosses will become blessings to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The same principle applies to sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some gain life through their sickness, while others merely go through the sickness; they gain nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What we gain depends on whether or not we are willing to accept what has come upon us as being from God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brothers and sisters, we have to re-evaluate everything we experienced before we were saved, that is, everything we did before we took God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not think that we should let the past be past.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to deal with the whole sequence of events all over again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have been separated to God from our mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything that happens to us individually should produce some spiritual result in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If others revile or scold us, and we hate them or murmur against them in our heart, even though we do not argue with them, we can develop serious heart trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this case the reaction is physiological.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we oppose them or fight against them, we may become disturbed mentally.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this case the reaction is psychological.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if we have learned the lesson of the cross, we will not react physiologically or psychologically; the matter will only produce spiritual lessons that are meaningful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to worship the Lord for our past.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If all our experiences are viewed in the light of the cross, they will become spiritual blessings to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only the cross will bring a person to a greater degree of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Gaining Revelation and Not Being a Spectator</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The revelation you have received from the Brethren is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have been like a spectator watching a show, not an actor participating in the show.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Outwardly you seemed to have seen this way, but you do not have enough inward revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the reason the truth has not become something absolute in you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Saul not only saw the great light shining on the way to Damascus, but he heard the voice of the Lord from heaven; he received an inward revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the reason he did not have to go to Jerusalem to ask the twelve disciples about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as he had seen something within, he did not need any outward evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are inwardly clear, we will believe in Him even if the whole world tells us that Jesus Christ is not the Son of God and the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A gospel candidate may say that he does not want to be baptized because he has been stumbled by a baptized sister who is still arguing with her husband at home.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Another brother may disagree with the practice of head covering because a sister who practices head covering is too talkative at home.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Another friend may not want to believe in the gospel because he has a Christian neighbor who always loses his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All three cases speak of men who reject God's way because they have not seen something real inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Had they seen the inward reality of baptism and head covering, they would not have thought that they could dispense with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a man really sees who Christ is, he will believe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If I argue with Brother Liu, you should not be stumbled just because we are arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You cannot negate the fact that we both have the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot change our footsteps because of human affections or worldly reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If our direction is not straight, our pathway will become crooked as soon as we set foot on it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We will become a spectator.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I am a Christian and do not have any revelation in my work, the opposition and criticism of other brothers and sisters who are working together with me in the field will naturally affect my work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if I work according to revelation, I will go on even if others oppose me or criticize me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I will work until I am justified.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I will not lose heart or be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No one knew the rebellion of the people of Israel more than Moses, yet he led them out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No one knew the church in Corinth more than Paul did, yet he called them saints 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Moses needed to have a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Without a vision, he would have been the first to bring the Israelites back to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord's workers need to have a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once they have a vision, their pathway will be straight.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some local churches do not appear to be up to the standard outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have to bring them up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have to have a proper start.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>An inward vision is the greatest source of power.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not Concentrating Our Thoughts on the Self</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to be careful when we speak of the things of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is possible that in speaking of these things, our attention will become focused on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some people need to be delivered from their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As for you, you have to be dealt with in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those with a strong mind are arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You come in contact with people every day.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you are a self-centered person, it is easy for you to get hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You have to know that the world does not live for your sake.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The only reason that hurt and offenses exist is that the one who is hurt is living for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Even after one is wounded, he can still be self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should not be bothered by others' treatment of us, whether it is good or evil, with or without sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I choose to ignore all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should learn not to be touched by outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Once our thoughts center around ourselves, we become self-centered, arrogant, assertive, and domineering.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>At the same time, we become very private.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We do not want to talk to others or mingle with them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We become lonely and cold.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But if we touch the cross, these conditions will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Our brother should have a specific pathway; he should no longer waste his time on minor and inconsequential work.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>You have to learn to be lowly in your thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Do not aim at the high things, and do not be a spectator.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You should not be offended easily and should not be self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In everything the Lord should be the center; everything should revolve around Him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Moreover, do not consider yourself to be so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Instead, always remain meek and obedient to the Lord.</S>
