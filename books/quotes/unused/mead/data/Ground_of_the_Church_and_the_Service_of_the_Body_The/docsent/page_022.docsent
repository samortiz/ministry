   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR PRINCIPLES REGARDING MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE HOMES IN THE CHURCH THE NATURE AND GROUND OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We see clearly from the Word that the function of the church is to be the Body of Christ Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12; Eph 1:22b-23; 4:4, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As to its nature, the Body is universal, but as to its expression in definite places on the earth, it is local.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the church has two aspects: a universal aspect and a local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to its universal aspect, the church is unique; there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, according to its local aspect, the church is expressed in different places at different times, representing the unique universal church and functioning as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the New Testament, there is only one church in the universe, yet it is expressed on earth in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that although the church is universal, its expression in this age is local.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This local expression, based on the ground of locality, is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Anything bigger or smaller than a locality is not fit to be the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ground of the church is local and does not change according to the size of a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church cannot have more than one expression in a big locality, or less than one expression in a small locality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It does not matter whether a locality is big or small, there can be only one local church within it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>History tells us that in the apostles time, Jerusalem may have had a population of over one million and that within Jerusalem there was a large number of believers; nevertheless, there was only one church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Acts 21:20 James and all the elders told Paul, You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On ordinary days, the many saved ones met in different homes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The phrase house to house in Acts 2:46 and 5:42 denotes not a single house but many houses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that although the believers met in many different homes, they were not divided into many churches; rather, they were still one church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the Bible says that they met in many homes, it does not say that these homes were different churches within Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the contrary, in Acts 8:1 the Bible uses the singular word church, not churches, when speaking of the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows that although there were many saved ones and many meetings within the homes, there was still only one expression of the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This one expression was for the one testimony on earth, that is, that the Lord s Body is one and has only one expression in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God wants us, the believers, to keep the nature of the oneness of the Body of Christ in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The New Testament also reveals that although a certain locality may be small, it cannot be joined to other small localities to form a single church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although there were many cities within the province of Galatia, the churches in Galatia were not joined together to become the church in Galatia ; rather, they were spoken of as the churches of Galatia Gal 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, the seven local churches in Asia were not added together to become one church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They remained seven churches Rev 1:4, 11-12, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they had united themselves, they would have lost the nature of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this reason, the church in a big locality cannot divide itself into many churches, nor can churches in smaller localities join together to form one church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not think that because the churches in two or three neighboring localities are small, they ought to join together to form one church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not permissible, because there can be only one church in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the church to maintain its nature of oneness, it must have only one expression in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The expression of each local church is a miniature, a small local representation, of the unique church in the universe, the unique Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, the local church in each locality is a miniature expression of the universal Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not to say that Christ has many Bodies on the earth; rather, this is to say that Christ has many miniature, or small-scale, expressions and that each small-scale expression is a representation of the unique large-scale Body in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible says that the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Universally it is one, but it is expressed in numerous localities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Body of Christ in Ephesians 1:22-23 is spoken of in reference to the church in its universal aspect, whereas the Body in Romans 12:5 and 1 Corinthians 12:12 is spoken of mainly in reference to the church in its local aspect.</S>
