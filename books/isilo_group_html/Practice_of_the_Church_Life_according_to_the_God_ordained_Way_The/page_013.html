The Autonomy of the Local Churches</H2><P>From the spring of 1988 the dissenting ones began to teach the autonomy of the local churches. Their teaching was based on G. H. Lang's book The Churches of God. They even purchased copies of this book and distributed them to the saints.</P><P>The teaching of the autonomy of the local churches is surely erroneous. The church cannot be absolutely autonomous. The United States is a federal country with fifty states. In a sense each state, having its own state government, is an autonomy. Even so, it is not altogether autonomous. All the fifty states have one ministry for the national defense, one ministry of foreign affairs, one constitutional law upheld by the Supreme Court (a federal court), one currency, one postal practice, and a federal highway system that runs through them all. In many things it is impossible for the fifty states to be autonomous.</P><P>It is ridiculous to say that the local churches could be absolutely autonomous. All the churches are the one Body of Christ (Eph. 4:4a). Can the parts of our physical body be autonomous? Could the hand be a small autonomy, the shoulder a large autonomy, and the thigh an even larger autonomy? If so, this would kill the body. All the parts of the body have only one circulation of blood. Thus, it is impossible for the Body of Christ to be autonomous. Beginning in the summer of 1988 and continuing through the remainder of that year, I spoke a number of messages exposing the fallacy of the teaching of autonomy (see A Timely Word, pages 29-30; The Body of Christ, pages 17-19; A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need, pages 33-34; The Building Up of the Body of Christ, pages 30-32; and Further Light concerning the Building Up of the Body of Christ, pages 29-30, published by Living Stream Ministry). After that, I did not hear much of this wrong teaching out of the dissenters' mouths. This may indicate they have realized that they do not have the truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. After Appointing the Elders,<br>the Apostles Keep Their Hands off<br>the Local Churches</H2><P>The dissenting brothers also said that after appointing the elders, the apostles should keep their hands off the local churches. However, after the apostle Paul appointed the elders in Ephesus, he did not keep his hands off the church there. Rather, he went back again and again to contact the church, and he also wrote the church an Epistle. At one point he remained in Ephesus for three years (Acts 19; 20:31). When he was journeying to Jerusalem in Acts 20, he passed through the region that was close to Ephesus, and he called for the elders from Ephesus to come to him at Miletus (vv. 17-38). There he told the elders that while he was in Asia he was with them all the time and did not withhold from them anything that was profitable, but for three years declared to them and taught them publicly and from house to house, admonishing them with tears (vv. 18, 20, 31). After appointing the elders in Ephesus, Paul certainly did not keep his hands off the church in Ephesus.</P><P>If, after setting up the churches and appointing the elders, the apostles keep their hands off the churches, eventually the apostles will have nothing to do. But Ephesians 4:12 says that the apostles are for the perfecting of the saints. To support their teaching, the dissenting ones used Brother Nee's writing in The Normal Christian Church Life, page 66: "Once a church was established, all responsibility was handed over to the local elders, and from that day the apostles exercised no control whatever in its affairs [italics added]." Later, in another book, Church Affairs, Brother Nee corrected this misuse of his words. On pages 14-26 Brother Nee dwelt on this one thing: he told his co-workers that after they appointed elders in a local church, they had to stay there to teach the elders, to train the elders, to show the elders, how to care for the church. (See A Timely Word, pages 27-29, and A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need, pages 15-18.)</P><P>The church in Shanghai was raised up in 1926, not by Brother Nee. The following year Brother Nee went to Shanghai to strengthen and establish the church in Shanghai. From that year, 1927, he never left Shanghai; he stayed there for twenty-five years, until 1952, when he was put into prison. All that time the church in Shanghai was under his hand.</P><P>The dissenting ones also said that during the apostles' time there were only twelve apostles: the eleven appointed by the Lord Jesus (not including Matthias), and the twelfth, Paul. Then I began to speak that this was an old teaching put out by the Brethren. Brother Nee adjusted this teaching in The Normal Christian Church Life. In that book Brother Nee gave a long word concerning the apostleship (see chapter one, "The Apostles"). Then the dissenters adjusted their speaking, saying that according to God's Word, the apostles are always plural in number. One of them said that there are many apostles today and that he could give the names of a number of these apostles. Later, he gave the names of certain brothers to one of the saints. After I heard this kind of speaking, I went to Taipei, and there I gave a message entitled "The Different Kinds of Apostles and the Relationships between Them" (see A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need, chapter two). In that message I pointed out that in the Bible there are only three kinds of apostles: (1) those appointed directly by the Lord and those constituted directly through the Lord's revelation, such as Peter, John, and Paul; (2) those perfected by others, such as Apollos; and (3) those produced by the Lord's directly appointed apostles, such as Timothy, Silas, and Titus. I also pointed out that according to the Bible the apostles of the third kind, those produced by the Lord's directly appointed apostles, are led and directed by those who produced them. Timothy, Silas, and Titus were not apostles of the first kind but were apostles of the third kind. Likewise, those brothers named by the dissenting one as today's apostles are all my students. Thus, they too are not apostles raised up and appointed directly by the Lord. Eventually, the dissenters changed their speaking again, saying that today there are no apostles.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practice of the Church Life according to the God-ordained Way &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
