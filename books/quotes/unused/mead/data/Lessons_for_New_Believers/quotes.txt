[1]  In relation to leading new believers, we have the following publications: Messages for Building Up New Believers by Watchman Nee and The Crucial Truths in the Bible in Chinese.
[2]  After serious consideration before the Lord, I feel to give some practical material for teaching new believers.
[3]  In leading new believers, we need to lay a firm and solid foundation in the matter of salvation.
[4]  Otherwise, we cannot expect them to grow, to walk the way of the Lord, to consecrate, or to serve the Lord.
[5]  Once we believe, God sprinkles us with the blood shed on the cross by His Son.
[6]  Without the sprinkling of the blood, God has no way to do the subsequent steps of the work of salvation in us.
[7]  We were evil, filthy, and full of transgressions, God s condemnation was upon us, and there was no way for the record of our sins to be annulled.
[8]  Once a person is justified, he is reconciled to God.
[9]  Colossians 1:20-22 shows that we, God s enemies, have been reconciled to God by the blood the Lord Jesus shed on the cross.
[10]  Romans 5:9-11 says that since we have been justified because of the Lord Jesus, we are also reconciled to God because of Him, or through Him.
[11]  Once we are regenerated, we pass out of death into life; we are made alive.
[12]  The Bible shows that formerly we were not only sinners; we were also dead.
[13]  Therefore, it is not enough for our sins to be washed away by the blood of His Son.
[14]  We also need to be regenerated by His life so that we can pass out of death into life and be made alive.
[15]  If God only cleanses us outwardly without regenerating us inwardly, His salvation would be like the work of a mortician.
[16]  In His salvation God not only wants to cleanse us, to take away our sins; He also wants to regenerate us, to make us alive.
[17]  In lesson 1 we considered nineteen aspects of our salvation.
[18]  Some of these aspects include being forgiven, reconciled to God, made alive, set free, and being saved.
[19]  But our salvation does not consist of merely these aspects.
[20]  We also need to help new believers know the kind of persons we have become after being saved.
[21]  Furthermore, Revelation 1:6; 5:10; and Philippians 3:20 show that we are the heavenly citizens of God s kingdom.
[22]  After we are saved, we become citizens in God s kingdom; hence, we are heavenly, particular, and different from others.
[23]  So once we are saved, we should not only have full enjoyment in the house of God, but we should also fulfill our obligations in the kingdom of God.
[24]  However, we must know that today we are citizens of God s kingdom, but ultimately we will reign in the kingdom of God.
[25]  Since we are the children of God, we are of God; since we are God s household, we are of God; since we are citizens of God s kingdom, we are of God; since we are priests of God, we are of God; since we are God s temple, we are of God; since we are God s inheritance, we are all the more of God.
[26]  Romans 8:9 shows that the believers belong to Christ also.
[27]  Since we are members of Christ, we are of Christ.
[28]  Furthermore, once we are of Christ, we are of Him eternally.
[29]  When we have the Triune God, we have the eternal life of God.
[30]  John 3:15 and 1 John 5:12 state this clearly.
[31]  The phrase life of God is spoken of once in the New Testament in Ephesians 4:18.
[32]  After a person is saved, his old way of living and his old conduct should come to an end. Before he was saved, he was a sinner living a life in sin.
[33]  He was also a man of the old creation, conducting himself in the old creation.
[34]  But now that he is saved, he should terminate the things of the past because he is a new person, having the life of the new creation.
[35]  A believer who desires to witness for the Lord and to walk the way of the Lord in a pure manner must fully terminate the things of his past.
[36]  For example, if a casino operator is saved, his sin of operating a casino has been forgiven by God.
[37]  All the dark things he may have done in operating the casino are forgiven by God.
[38]  However, if he desires to be a proper Christian and follow the Lord, he must stop operating the casino.
[39]  In Acts 19:19 the believers in Ephesus who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them.
[40]  The value of the books was fifty thousand pieces of silver.
[41]  We have used this example as a basis for helping others to have a burning of demonic, filthy, and improper things.
[42]  Before the Lord we should terminate our past living.
[43]  Although the Bible does not have a definite example concerning this point, the revelation of the New Testament shows that God desires us to bring our past living before Him in order to terminate it.
[44]  Should we continue to parent as we did in the past, or study in the way we did in the past?
[45]  Should we continue to live our lives as we did in the past, having the same type of relationship between husband and wife, the same type of friendships, dressing in the same way, and even spending money in the same way?
[46]  Every person should enter through the gate of consecration as soon as he is saved in order to walk the way of consecration.
[47]  A person who wants God to work in him must be consecrated.
[48]  The Bible says that we, the believers, are living stones.
[49]  God desires to use these living stones to build His spiritual house, His dwelling place.
[50]  Offering ourselves to God is also to grant Him the right that He deserves in regard to us.
[51]  First Corinthians 6:19-20 says that we are not our own because we have been bought with a price.
[52]  This price is the precious blood shed by the Lord on the cross.
[53]  Since the Lord has purchased us, He has authority over us and we belong to Him, just as we own whatever we pay for.
[54]  Although God has purchased us, He can be prevented from enjoying His right over us if we disagree with His use of us.
[55]  We now need to consider the practice of consecration, that is, how to practice consecration.
[56]  Consecration is a gate, and we must be determined to enter through this gate.
[57]  After consecration, a believer needs to learn to walk according to the spirit.
[58]  In general, Christians do not know what spirit refers to in the phrase walking according to the spirit.
[59]  Hence, with regard to walking according to the spirit, they have a common but inaccurate understanding: they think that this means to obey the Holy Spirit.
[60]  After the enlivening and renewing of our spirit, the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit and lives in our spirit.
[61]  Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.
[62]  Therefore, not only is our spirit, including the conscience, made alive and renewed, but the life and nature of God Himself dwells within our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit as one spirit.
[63]  In a Christian s living, the most important thing is to obey God.
[64]  However, these words seem very abstract and are not easily realized.
[65]  Obeying God really means to walk according to the spirit.
[66]  To obey God is not merely to walk according to the letter of the Bible nor according to the teachings in the Bible.
[67]  When we walk according to the sense of our spirit, we are obeying God.
[68]  This lesson is to aid new believers in reading the Bible.
[69]  The points in this lesson will be presented in a simple and practical way.
[70]  New believers must know that the Bible is the word of God.
[71]  Since the Bible is the breathing of God Himself and is written by the prophets and apostles who were moved by the Spirit of God, it is the word of God.
[72]  We should also have an attitude of coming to receive the life supply.
[73]  We should never come to the Bible to seek knowledge or study facts.
[74]  This can be compared to studying the rice, meat, and vegetables on the table instead of eating them so that we can be nourished and supplied.
[75]  The Bible is a treasure store of the spiritual bread of life.
[76]  This is not merely a matter of understanding or comprehending with our mind; it is a matter of receiving the life supply from the Bible with our spirit.
[77]  Second, we should not read too much each time; at the most, one chapter should be read at a time.
[78]  Some suggest reading one chapter of the New Testament in the morning and three chapters of the Old Testament during the second time.
[79]  In this way one can read through the entire Bible once a year.
[80]  Although I formerly agreed with such a practice, I now feel that it may not be so beneficial.
[81]  Fifth, we should also learn to memorize the precious verses in the Bible.
[82]  There are precious verses in almost every chapter or portion in the Bible.
[83]  Whenever we come across these portions, whether it is a verse or a sentence, we should memorize it.
[84]  Even if we are unable to accurately memorize every word, we should memorize the main idea.
[85]  For example, the most precious portion in Genesis 1 is verse 26: God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.
[86]  Seventh, we should not seek a thorough understanding when reading the Bible.
[87]  It is necessary to understand what we are reading, but to seek too much understanding may turn out to be harmful because it causes us to be preoccupied with matters that we are not prepared to understand.
[88]  We should simply understand what we can of what we read and lay aside whatever we cannot understand.
[89]  We should simply let them go because it is important that we read a portion of the Bible daily.
[90]  Let us briefly consider twenty-one points concerning prayer.
[91]  Prayer is the human spirit contacting the Spirit of God, through which man absorbs God.
[92]  Therefore, the significance of prayer lies not in asking God for things but in contacting and absorbing God.
[93]  The dealing for prayer is the confession of sins.
[94]  A person who knows how to pray spends much of his prayer time confessing his sins.
[95]  This is because there are many inward and outward problems in our being when we come before God.
[96]  If we draw near to God with a sincere heart and an open spirit, He will shine in us as light.
[97]  When He shines in us, exposing our real self and true condition, we must confess our sins.
[98]  Every person who comes before God in prayer should not utter casual and empty words; rather, he should pray according to the burden and inward sense.
[99]  However, the burden of prayer should not be so broad that it covers eight or ten points all at once.
[100]  Some people pray as if they are reciting a book or taking attendance.
[101]  The emphasis in giving thanks is to thank God for His grace, and the emphasis in praising is to praise God for His acts.
[102]  God s grace requires thanksgiving, and His acts require praises.
[103]  God has ordained a way of existence for every living creature in this universe.
[104]  There is a personal aspect as well as a corporate aspect of the grace that God gives to man.
[105]  According to the personal aspect, we can receive grace when we read the Bible, pray, seek after God, and contact God.
[106]  However, there is a corporate aspect of grace that can never be obtained through just our personal contact with God.
[107]  For example, a person can be touched by the gospel and receive salvation when he thinks of God or reads a spiritual book or a portion of the Bible on his own.
[108]  In the previous lesson we covered the importance of meeting, the benefit of meeting, and the result of not meeting.
[109]  In this lesson we will consider how to meet.
[110]  Although meeting is a spiritual matter, there is still the need of teaching and leading.
[111]  The second aspect of the purpose of meeting is toward man.
[112]  We attend meetings not only to worship God but also to edify others.
[113]  We must not think that as a new believer we are unable to edify others.
[114]  This is the fourth aspect of the purpose of our meetings.
[115]  If we do not meet, we lose the opportunity to shame the devil.
[116]  In preparing for a meeting we need to be ready to receive grace, light, supply, and help.
[117]  Before coming to a meeting, we should prepare ourselves to receive grace, light, supply, and help in the meeting.
[118]  Now we will consider several aspects of how we should conduct ourselves in a meeting.
[119]  When we come to a meeting, we must first put aside our personal feelings.
[120]  If we have lost our temper before a meeting, we should put aside our anger when we come to the meeting.
[121]  Once a meeting has begun, we need to lead it to the subject according to the feeling of the meeting.
[122]  For example, at a meeting we may sense that the feeling of the brothers and sisters is that the Lord is in glory; hence, this is the feeling and subject of the meeting.
[123]  We have covered four points concerning how to meet.
[124]  After touching the feeling of a meeting, we should learn to function in the meeting.
[125]  We should not come to a meeting merely to listen to a message or to watch others worship; instead, we should come to meet in mutuality.
[126]  We should reject not only accusations but also burdens.
[127]  For example, the responsibility of giving a message after a meeting may be a burden on a brother, preventing him from being released in the meeting.
[128]  We need to give our burdens to God through prayer.
[129]  No matter what kind of burden we have to bear, whether it is related to our work, our family, or our business, we should put it aside once we come to a meeting.
[130]  We must select hymns according to the sense in our spirit.
[131]  We should not mechanically consider the nature of a meeting, or even the stage of the meeting, and then flip through our hymnal to find a suitable hymn.
[132]  Hymns that are selected in such a dead way will not be according to the spirit of the meeting.
[133]  Concerning the activities in the meeting, there is also speaking in addition to selecting hymns and praying.
[134]  Speaking includes testifying, exhorting, and releasing the light we have received from the Bible.
[135]  In principle, the points that apply to selecting hymns and praying also apply to speaking.
[136]  When we speak in a meeting, we should follow the nature of the meeting; otherwise, our speaking can interrupt the atmosphere and even kill the spirit of the meeting.
[137]  When functioning in a meeting, we also need to learn the lesson of submission.
[138]  In a meeting the responsible brothers may give advice in any of three points.
[139]  In this lesson we come to the various kinds of meetings and their natures.
[140]  It is evident that a person must know the focus and activities of each meeting if he desires to serve and function in the meetings.
[141]  Eating the Lord s supper, as presented in 1 Corinthians 11, is mainly for our remembrance of the Lord.
[142]  He then explains that to have fellowship in the Lord s blood and the Lord s body is to partake of the Lord s table v. 21 . Since partaking of the Lord s table is for us to share in His table, the focus in this aspect is not on remembering, receiving, and enjoying the Lord but on having fellowship with all the saints in the Lord.
[143]  In addition to having a focus and coordinating and cooperating together, we need to move toward a climax in every meeting.
[144]  This enables the meeting to climb higher and higher.
[145]  Once a meeting reaches the climax, the bread and the cup should be blessed and passed.
[146]  The second kind of meeting is the prayer meeting.
[147]  Acts 4:24 to 31 and 12:5 and 12 are two portions in the Bible that speak of the church gathering and praying together corporately.
[148]  We should not be a person with a mouth that does not open or a mouth that does not shut once we begin to pray.
[149]  Some people seem to have problems with their mouth in the prayer meeting.
[150]  Either they cannot open their mouth to pray, or when they do open their mouth, they cannot conclude their prayer and close their mouth.
[151]  The third kind of meeting is for the exercise of gifts as presented in 1 Corinthians 14:26-40.
[152]  The bread-breaking meeting is a meeting of the church where all the saints function in mutuality.
[153]  In the past we held a weekly fellowship meeting that was similar in nature to a meeting for the exercise of gifts spoken of in 1 Corinthians 14.
[154]  The fourth kind of meeting is the Bible-study meeting.
[155]  In this meeting the saints gather to read the Lord s Word.
[156]  Acts 15:30-31 and Colossians 4:16 both refer to this kind of meeting.
[157]  There are five points for us to consider related to the Bible-study meeting.
[158]  The sixth kind of meeting is for the preaching of the gospel.
[159]  In particular, new believers should exercise to participate in this meeting.
[160]  We should not merely come by ourselves, but we should try our best to bring people to hear the gospel.
[161]  Today everyone would admit that the situation in Christianity is chaotic.
[162]  After believing in the Lord, we must know the church and the proper way of the church.
[163]  We cannot know the church merely by studying the truth but rather by taking the proper way to follow the Lord after we are saved.
[164]  In the Bible God uses the type of the building of Eve in Genesis 2:21-24 as a clear and definite illustration of how the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, in Ephesians 1:22-23 is brought forth in 5:30-32.
[165]  These verses show that Adam and Eve are a type of the relationship between Christ and the church.
[166]  Just as Eve came out of Adam, the church also comes out of Christ.
[167]  The church is composed not only of one person or several persons but of millions of people.
[168]  These millions have become one Body not only because they are of Christ but also because they have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body 1 Cor 12:13 .
[169]  The life of Christ within you causes you to be of Christ, and the life of Christ within me also causes me to be of Christ.
[170]  The life of Christ in every believer causes them to be of Christ.
[171]  In the previous lesson we saw a general sketch of the church and briefly touched the concept of the church.
[172]  These, however, are primarily abstract theories regarding the church and are not so definite.
[173]  Hence, we need to speak about the expression of the church.
[174]  Since the church is expressed in a locality, it is on the earth and exists today.
[175]  Hence, as far as space is concerned, the church s expression is on the earth; as far as time is concerned, this expression exists today.
[176]  Neither do we need to wait for the church to be expressed in heaven, because the church is expressed on earth today.
[177]  Since every local church is the expression of the universal church in that locality, the sum total of the local churches throughout time is the universal church.
[178]  In totality, all the local churches in time constitute the universal church.
[179]  to the Workers and Believers The Work of the Workers
[180]  Church A should not intervene in the practical affairs of church B; likewise, church B should not intervene in the practical affairs of church A. Although churches in villages and towns may be small, they are still the church in that locality, and other churches can neither intervene nor interfere with their practical affairs.
[181]  Although the administration of the local churches is independent in each locality, the fellowship of the local churches is of the Body and is universal.
[182]  First Corinthians 10:16 says, The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ?
[183]  This indicates that the fellowship of the church is of the Body.
[184]  If the church in a locality is not one in fellowship with the other local churches, that local church becomes a local sect.
[185]  The expression of the Body of Christ, the house of God, is local, and there is only one expression in each locality.
[186]  On the one hand, the administration of each church is local; on the other hand, all the churches are one with regard to their move, having the common goal of upholding God s testimony on the earth.
[187]  It is not sufficient for us to realize only this; we need to know the oneness of the church.
[188]  The oneness of the church is also the unity of the church.
[189]  If we use the word unity, we are implying that there was a time when the church was not one.
[190]  There are not many churches in the universe; there is only one church.
[191]  Therefore, the church is uniquely one in the universe; there is only one church.
[192]  The church is one universally and also one locally.
[193]  The nature of the church is one, and there is only one kind of church.
[194]  The basic Christian faith consists only of the seven ones spoken of in Ephesians 4:4-6.
[195]  Apart from these seven ones, nothing should be considered as basic to the faith.
[196]  Our fundamental faith can have only this one faith.
[197]  If we consider the many possible different doctrinal views as being part of the one faith, the fundamental faith, there will surely be many divisions among God s children.
[198]  Now we come to the fourth lesson on the ground of the church.
[199]  This matter can be said to be the key to knowing the church in today s chaotic situation.
[200]  If someone desires to know the church, he must know the ground of the church.
[201]  For example, if we want to determine whether a family is the Chang family, we should not look at its condition but rather at its ground.
[202]  We should never think that the local ground is detached from the Body of Christ.
[203]  The local ground is the unique ground, the ground of oneness.
[204]  It is also the ground of the Body and of the universal church.
[205]  Consequently, all of the benefits of the church come from this ground.
[206]  Once this ground is lost, the church suffers severely.
[207]  However, in today s deformed Christianity there are churches everywhere, clearly indicating that the church is divided.
[208]  Therefore, we must now look at the division of the church.
[209]  God s intention is to build up His church locality by locality so that there would be a local church in every place as the expression of the Body of Christ in order to express Christ.
[210]  If there were only one church in each locality with no confusion or divisions, and if all the local churches were one in expressing Christ, preaching Christ, and leading people to know God on the earth, this would be glorious.
[211]  With every matter, there must be someone who bears the responsibility.
[212]  Related to the division of the church, there must also be someone who bears the responsibility.
[213]  A careful and logical examination will show that the responsibility of division should be borne completely by those who stand on the ground of the denominations, not by those standing on the local ground.
[214]  In today s divided situation where sects and denominations are rampant, Christians must have the discernment to know what is proper and what should rightly remain.
[215]  We must have this discernment because Christians must have a church; we cannot be without a church.
[216]  A person in the world needs to be saved and become a Christian; after becoming a Christian, he needs the church.
[217]  However, there are too many churches today; not only is there the Roman Catholic Church, but there are also numerous sects and denominations in Protestantism that call themselves churches.
[218]  Therefore, we must have the discernment; we cannot say that it is sufficient as long as there is a church.
[219]  In order to discern, we must know how a division is formed, because once a division is formed, the ground of the church is lost, and it becomes a condemnable sect.
[220]  There are six conditions involved in the formation of a division.
[221]  This does not mean that all six conditions must be present in order for a division or sect to be constituted.
[222]  In relation to knowing the church, we have covered five lessons on what the church is, the expression of the church, the oneness of the church, the ground of the church, and the division of the church.
[223]  We have seen that the church is neither a lifeless building nor an organization of man s intention.
[224]  Rather, the church is an assembly of the called-out ones, the Body of Christ, and the house of the living God.
[225]  Contrary to what most people believe, the church s expression is not in heaven or in eternity.
[226]  according to the Principle of the Local Church and by Virtue of the Nature
[227]  Although we differ from others, because of the ground we absolutely will not form a unique sect, establishing our meetings in different localities.
[228]  Rather, we desire to meet and serve the Lord in various places on the ground of the oneness of the church, that is, the ground of locality, with all those who repudiate division and reject sectarianism.
[229]  Although we receive brothers and sisters with different views, we cannot commit any responsibility in the service to them.
[230]  Therefore, although the Lord s table is open to all God s children and every believer can partake of it, we cannot be so open related to responsibility in the service.
[231]  On one hand, we should not take part in a denomination that may be there, and on the other hand, we should endeavor to preach the gospel to lead people to be saved, to know the church, and to have a clear understanding of the ground and the way of the church so that a proper meeting on the ground of the church can be established with them.
[232]  Now we come to our attitude, which is our declaration.
[233]  Just as we do not consider the Roman Catholic Church to be proper, we also do not consider the Protestant churches to be proper.
[234]  LESSON NINETEEN SERVING THE LORD THE STATUS FOR SERVICE
[235]  Once we are saved, our status is completely changed.
[236]  After our salvation there are many aspects to our status.
[237]  For example, we are children of God in His household and citizens in His kingdom Eph 2:19 .
[238]  Revelation 1:5-6 and 5:9-10 say that God saved us in order to make us not only His people but also His priests.
[239]  Serving the Lord is also a matter of the heart, a matter of desire.
[240]  When we speak concerning the heart, the desire to serve the Lord, we must first speak of the Lord s love.
[241]  One who is genuinely saved has tasted the Lord s love.
[242]  Even an indifferent Christian, a backsliding believer, has been touched by the Lord s love.
[243]  According to the Chinese Union Version, in 2 Corinthians 5:14-15 the apostle Paul says that as we consider how the Lord died for all, His love will motivate us and cause us to no longer live to ourselves but to Him.
[244]  This story of love can never be quenched in a Christian, and it always stirs our heart, our desire, so that we cannot help but serve God.
[245]  Moreover, in Romans 12:1 the apostle Paul says, I exhort you...through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice...to God, which is your reasonable service.
[246]  To serve God in this way is reasonable; it is logical and rational, because we are people saved by grace and loved by God.
[247]  Our service must be fully according to the Spirit, not according to the letter 2 Cor 3:6 .
[248]  This requires our utmost attention when we serve the Lord.
[249]  Serving according to the Spirit, not according to the letter, means to constantly live before the Lord in spirit.
[250]  In whatever we do in our service, whether dusting the chairs or cleaning the windows, we must follow the Spirit and live before the Lord.
[251]  If God takes care of our living, we do not need to set aside the time, strength, and energy to earn a living, but if God does not give us this kind of provision, we should set aside the time, strength, and energy to work in order to support our living according to His leading.
[252]  LESSON TWENTY PREACHING THE GOSPEL THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PREACH THE GOSPEL
[253]  The gospel preaching we refer to is not the preaching commonly referred to by others.
[254]  The Bible says that every believer is a branch in the true vine, which is the Lord Himself John 15:1-2 .
[255]  There is a common belief in Christianity that the power of gospel preaching is the issue of sufficient prayer and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
[256]  There is no doubt that prayer and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit are needed in order to have power for preaching the gospel.
[257]  However, a new believer does not rely that much on prayer or the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for power when he preaches the gospel.
[258]  There are two things that newly saved brothers and sisters should pay attention to when preaching the gospel.
[259]  On the one hand, we should expect results, but on the other hand, we should not trust too much in the results.
[260]  We should hope for results, expecting large numbers of people to be saved, even expecting people of fine character to be saved.
[261]  However, we should not have confidence in results, saying, It is so wonderful to have more than six hundred people baptized.
[262]  We should realize that the best ones probably have not even been baptized and that those who have been baptized may not remain for long.
[263]  Experience shows that most of a believer s problems are related to fellowship.
[264]  If a believer has normal fellowship, his life will be normal.
[265]  Since this is a very broad topic, we will cover it in a few lessons.
[266]  Now we will focus on our fellowship with God.
[267]  The more we can labor on this topic, the better.
[268]  It is very difficult to explain the statement that God is Spirit because it is difficult to explain the matter of Spirit.
[269]  When the Bible refers to God as Spirit, using the term Spirit to refer to God, the emphasis is on God being the highest life, a life that is not physical and cannot be touched by man with the five senses used to contact the physical world.
[270]  Third, we must see that our fellowship with God is the fellowship between two spirits, that is, the mutual fellowship between the human spirit and the divine Spirit.
[271]  God Himself is Spirit, and we have a spirit in the depths of our being.
[272]  When these two spirits commune with each other, there is fellowship.
[273]  If we cannot see this point, it will be difficult for us to practice fellowship with God.
[274]  God created the cattle, the sheep, the birds in the air, and the fish in the sea, but He did not give any of them a spirit because He did not intend for them to contact and receive Him.
[275]  One effect of our fellowship with God is the constant removal of things that should not be within us.
[276]  Practically speaking, fellowship with God, like breathing, should be constant and not limited by time.
[277]  If we breathe in the morning, we still need to breathe in the evening.
[278]  Likewise, our fellowship with God cannot be limited to only one time.
[279]  There should not be a time or a place in which we stop fellowshipping with God.
[280]  THE PLACE TO FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD Anytime and Anywhere
[281]  Whether we are traveling, working, taking a walk, or listening to a message, we can fellowship with God at all times and in all places.
[282]  We have covered seven main points concerning the practice of fellowship.
[283]  Although we divided the lessons on the practice of fellowship into different points and have covered each point, our intention is not to understand more doctrine but to enter into the reality of fellowship in our daily living.
[284]  Therefore, the saints who participate in this training should not merely come to listen to doctrine or learn some truth; rather, they should practice according to our fellowship.
[285]  As we listen to these lessons, we should make a resolution before God to set aside a specific time each day to practice this kind of fellowship.
[286]  Second, our prayer should not be influenced by the things in our memory.
[287]  Many people have a difficult time praying because they are influenced by their memory.
[288]  Then when I knelt down to pray, I would spend much effort trying to remember what I should pray for, and as a result, I failed to contact God in spirit.
[289]  We should never try to remember things to pray for when we fellowship with God.
[290]  We should never be distracted and consider other things after we confess our sins.
[291]  Once we are distracted, the Spirit will stop moving within us.
[292]  For example, it is very good for a sister to sense the need to confess as she is fellowshipping with God.
[293]  Therefore, when we sense something in our fellowship with God, especially the need to confess, we should never think of other things or bring other things into our fellowship.
[294]  Even though we are still praying, these things can become serious distractions, and we will have no way to touch God s presence.
[295]  Let us speak briefly to the leading ones concerning how to lead the meeting for the practice of fellowship.
[296]  If we want to lead new believers into this kind of fellowship, we must first tell them all the main points.
[297]  We should not speak too much at one time.
[298]  In the previous lesson, we covered the first means of fellowship with God, which is prayer.
[299]  Now we come to the second means, which is reading the Bible.
[300]  We do not need doctrines concerning reading the Bible.
[301]  Rather, I want to point out a practical method for us to practice so that we can fellowship with God through Bible reading.
[302]  Whenever we speak of reading the Bible, our natural concept is that it refers to understanding the Bible and knowing the contents of the Bible.
[303]  However, reading the Bible as a means to fellowship with God is neither for understanding the Bible nor for knowing the contents of the Bible; rather, it is entirely for fellowshipping with God and contacting Him.
[304]  Therefore, we must give up this intention whenever we come to God for fellowship through reading the Bible; we should simply come to fellowship with God through His Word without caring whether or not we understand it.
[305]  To ponder is another temptation when reading the Bible.
[306]  It is strange that when we read fast, we cannot stop our mind, but when we read slowly, we often ponder.
[307]  For example, when we read, In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, we begin to consider what the beginning refers to and how many places the heavens and the earth include.
[308]  When reading the Bible in this way, we also need to pay attention to maintaining constant contact with the Lord and not being distracted by the outward letters.
[309]  We should not pay attention only to reading but forget to contact the Lord.
[310]  It is not easy to maintain our fellowship with the Lord when reading the Bible for ten to twenty minutes in this way.
[311]  Some people can contact the Lord without reading the Bible, but once they start reading the Bible, their contact with the Lord is interrupted.
[312]  When we touch the Lord s Word with our spirit and remain in continual fellowship with Him, our spirit should have a feeling of being bathed, as if our whole being were taking a bath in the Bible.
[313]  LESSON TWENTY-FIVE THE PRACTICE OF FELLOWSHIP 5 PRAYING AND READING THE BIBLE
[314]  According to our experience, praying and reading the Bible always complement each other and cannot be separated when we truly fellowship with God.
[315]  It is difficult for a man to walk with one leg.
[316]  In our fellowship with God it may seem as if praying and reading the Bible are separate matters, just like our right and left legs.
[317]  Third, John says that the Word is the Spirit.
[318]  John writes in his Gospel that the Lord Jesus Himself said that His words are spirit John 6:63 .
[319]  We pray in the Spirit, and we read the Word.
[320]  Because God is the Spirit and is in the Spirit, we need to exercise our spirit to pray in order to contact Him.
[321]  Similarly, because God is the Word and is in the Word, we need to read the Word in order to contact Him.
[322]  As children of God, we may not have heard and understood much doctrine, but we do have some experience.
[323]  As soon as we touch the Word of God, we sense that we have touched God.
[324]  If we understand this, we will overthrow the erroneous concepts that we pray in order to ask God to give us something or to do something for us and that we read the Bible because we want to understand doctrine.
