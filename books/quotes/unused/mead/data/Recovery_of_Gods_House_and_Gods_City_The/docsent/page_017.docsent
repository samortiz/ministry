   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MAN ON THE RED HORSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Who is the man riding on the red horse among the myrtle trees?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The myrtle trees are the people of Israel, and at this time they were really in the bottom, for they were in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Babylon is never on top, but always in the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you like to live and work in the bottom?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why do you love Babylon so much?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should all come back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may think that Babylon is good, but you must realize that Jerusalem is on top and Babylon is in the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the past years, when those working in the denominations came to talk with us, they always sounded as if they were low.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were in the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even they themselves sensed that they were not on top.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we come back to the local churches, we are on top, regardless of how much others oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even when they say we are wrong, we can sense in their speech that they know we are on top and they are in the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Myrtle trees are not grand trees like the cedars or pines, but small trees which grow in the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the people of Israel in their captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were in the bottom; yet praise the Lord! the Lord Jesus was with them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But how was He among them?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times people ask us, "Don't you think if we have Christ, that is enough?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Don't you think that Christ is among us?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes, Christ is among those in the bottom, but for what purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To bring them out of the bottom!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No human words can express what mercy and love the Lord has toward those in captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is even among the believers who are still in the Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But do you think that Christ is with them that they may remain there?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, He is with them to bring them out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is not sleeping there, but riding on to bring them out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has no intention to settle Catholicism is not His settlement.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That is the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The denominations and the free groups are not His settlements.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are also the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is there, but Christ is riding through there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is not a myrtle tree planted at the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may be planted there, but He is not.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is riding on!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is riding on a red horse!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This signifies sacrifice and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And He prayed for the captivity: "O Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Zech 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ prayed for the people who were in the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the desire of Christ expressed in His intercession for those in the captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And God answered, "I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of hosts, and a line shall be stretched upon Jerusalem" Zech 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have the full assurance that the Lord's recovery today is due to Christ's intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is interceding for those who are still in the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE FOUR HORNS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the second vision, God raised up four horns and four carpenters to work out the situation for the captives to return.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do believe that today we still have the four horns.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Twenty years ago, I never dreamed that there could be a local church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many know that I had no intention of coming to this country.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the Lord worked out the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ was interceding for the captivity, and the Father answered by causing the king of Persia to send the captives back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was one of the horns.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The horns are the powers in the situation who accomplish something so that the people can return to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ interceded for the return of the captivity, and the Father answered by raising up the horns to make the return possible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I believe that the same thing is being done today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THE SENDER AND THE SENT ONE</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the third vision, a measuring line was put upon Jerusalem so that once more it might be possessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To measure something means to take it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord is going to take over Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This signifies that today the Lord is going to take over the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The measuring line has been put upon the United States!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this vision we see that the Lord is both the Sender and the Sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"For thus saith the Lord of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye" Zech 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we read the entire context, we see that the Sender and the Sent One are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord of Hosts is the Sender, and the Lord of Hosts is also the Sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ is the Sender, and He is also the Sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ today is not only the life in the recovery of the local churches, He is also the Sender and the Sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He sent Himself to come into the situation to work out everything so that the local churches might be recovered.</S>
