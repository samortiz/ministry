   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE MIXED EXPRESSIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE PSALMIST'S SENTIMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN HIS ENJOYMENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN GOD'S HOUSE 4 Scripture Reading: Psa 34 36</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we want to continue our fellowship on the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in his enjoyment of God in God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not have a deep hunger to seek after the Lord with His Word, these messages may disappoint us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because what we may like according to our natural concept is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we see in the Bible and what the Bible is to us depend upon what kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our understanding of the Bible is always according to what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why we need to be adjusted and brought into the divine concept.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this message we want to see the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiment in Psalms 34 36.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The title of Psalm 34 says that this was a psalm of David "when he disguised his sanity before Abimelech, who drove him out, and he departed."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can see from this that the situation in which Psalm 34 was written was not an honorable one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>David was not normal; he disguised himself as being insane because he was before a king who had the power to kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result of disguising himself, David was delivered from Abimelech 1 Sam 21:10 22:1a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Afterward, he wrote Psalm 34.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this psalm he gave all the credit to God, but actually he delivered himself by disguising himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To disguise oneself is a kind of falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Psalm 35 David asked God to fight against his enemies with weapons vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then in Psalm 36 he asked God to deal with the wicked vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1-4 and even gave God instructions as to how to deal with them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to remember that the book of Psalms needs to be interpreted according to the divine concept of the divine revelation in the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Psalms is the longest book of the Bible, but it is not the only book.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It must be interpreted in the light of the divine concept of God as the divine revelation concerning His eternal economy in Christ, taking Christ as its centrality and universality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to be adjusted from our human concept to the divine concept.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the beginning of my Christian life, I came to the Bible with much of my own thought.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Throughout the years I have been adjusted, and the adjustment which I have received in studying the Bible has taken away layer upon layer of my human concept.</S>
