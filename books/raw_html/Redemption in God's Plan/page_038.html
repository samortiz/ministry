        <h2 class="head1">WORKING FROM OUR SPIRIT INTO OUR SOUL</h2>
<p>When we first begin to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption, God reveals His Son through the Spirit in our spirit to be our life (Gal.1:16; John 3:6). From that point until now, God&rsquo;s work through the Spirit is focused on working the life of His Son in our spirit into our entire being.</p>
<p>When we were redeemed by God initially, we received Christ in our spirit as life, but Christ as life was not in our soul. Our spirit was constituted with the life and nature of the Son because we were joined to the Lord as one spirit. However, the element of the Son was not present in the parts of our soul&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will. As a result, our mind, emotion, and will could not express the image of the Son. When we appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption, receive the Spirit&mdash;the transfiguration of Christ&mdash;in our spirit, and consecrate to allow God to continue His work in us, the element of Christ will spread from our spirit into the parts of our soul. In our position of consecration, God will continually work the element of Christ from our spirit into the parts of our soul&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will&mdash;so that the image of Christ can be expressed through the parts of our soul.</p>
<p>After being saved, a brother may be very zealous, but there may be no flavor of the Lord in his mind; that is, his reasonings and thoughts are full of his own element. Thus, without the element of the Lord in his mind, there is no expression of the image of the Lord through his reasonings and thoughts. Likewise, after being saved, a sister&rsquo;s conduct can be very good, but there may be no flavor of the Lord in her emotion; that is, her desires reflect only her element. Thus, without any element of the Lord in her desires, there is no expression of the image of the Lord through her desires. Still others may have much spiritual pursuit after being saved, but there is no place for the Lord in their will; that is, all their decisions come from themselves instead of from the Lord. Consequently, there is no sense or flavor of the Lord with them. It is possible to receive Christ as the Spirit in our spirit but not allow God to work the element of Christ from our spirit into the parts of our soul&mdash;the mind, emotion, and will. Although we have Christ in our spirit, we may not have His element in the parts of our soul. In order to bear the image of Christ so that people sense the flavor of God in our mind, emotion, and will, we must offer ourselves unconditionally to God so that He can work the element of Christ from our spirit into all the parts of our soul through His Spirit. When we are willing to allow God to work in us in such a way, we will not only have the life and nature of Christ in our spirit but also the element and flavor of Christ in our soul. Then we will bear the image of Christ, and people will sense the flavor of Christ in our thoughts, preferences, and decisions.</p>
<p>Our mind, emotion, and will are full of our own element. We live by our mind, emotion, and will, and we express our mind, emotion, and will. These parts are full of our element and express only us. However, God wants our whole being to be filled with His Son to express His Son. His first step is to reveal His Son in our spirit. His second step is to work from our spirit into our soul so that the parts of our soul, which we now live according to, may be filled with the element of His Son and express the image of His Son. Consequently, God must deal with our mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p>Hence, after we are saved, God renews our mind (Rom. 12:2), delivering our reasonings and thoughts from earthly things in order to mind the things of Christ. He also brings the arrogant and self-exalting thoughts in our mind unto the obedience of Christ (2 Cor. 10:5), renewing our mind from our old thoughts in order to have the mind of Christ (1 Cor. 2:16). God not only purifies our mind but also fills our mind with the element of His Son. Through His renewing, all the activities of our mind, whether thoughts, considerations, or realizations, will express the image of His Son.</p>
<p>After we are saved, God also touches our emotion so that our desire would be inclined toward Christ. Thus, God delivers our emotion out of the realm of earthly things to focus on His Son, and He also deals with our emotion so that its love will match Christ&rsquo;s love. In this way He causes our emotion to be filled with the element of Christ so that our inclinations, preferences, delight, anger, sorrow, and joy will express the image of Christ.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after we are saved, God also deals with our will, causing our will to not only choose and obey Christ but even to make the choices and decisions of Christ our choices and decisions. In this way, God not only breaks, subdues, and purifies our will but also fills our will with the element of Christ. Thus, the actions of our will in our decisions, choices, and judgments will be those of Christ, expressing the image of Christ.</p>
<p>We have Christ as our life in our spirit. Now the primary work of God in us is to work the life of Christ in our spirit into the parts of our soul and eventually to spread to our body.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
