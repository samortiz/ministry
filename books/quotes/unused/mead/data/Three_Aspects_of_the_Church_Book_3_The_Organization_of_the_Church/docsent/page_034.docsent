   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE SOME MATTERS RELATED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO FULL-TIME SERVICE 2 GIVING ALL THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not consider that the full-time serving ones are a special group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, we should not take the presence of the full-time serving ones as a reason to lessen the responsibility of or reduce the opportunity for other brothers and sisters to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Currently, there is such a trend in some local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some saints have told the leading ones, Since there are full-time serving ones, why do you want us to serve?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the saints have such a concept, we should immediately reduce the number of full-time serving ones so that those who say such things will come and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of speaking has several possible implications.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, it indicates that the saints have the heart to serve but have not been given the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, it shows that although they desired to serve, they no longer have such a desire because they see that the full-timers are serving.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Third, they may think that they are not needed because there are full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The thought behind the third implication is negative and unintentionally causes the full-time serving ones to become a special group within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a thought makes serving the Lord the business of the full-time serving ones and allows the saints who are not serving full time to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To counteract this, the responsible brothers in all the churches should endeavor and try their best to give the working saints opportunities to serve and be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way, we can avoid the possibility of the full-time serving ones becoming a special class.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In every locality we should help the brothers and sisters see that serving the Lord is for everyone, regardless of whether they are serving full time or holding a job.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is an erroneous concept to think that only those who drop their jobs can minister the word in a ministry meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is true that some according to the Lord s leading, commission, and arrangement drop their jobs to serve full time in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, it would be even better if some who hold jobs would also minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we should not say that only those who drop their jobs can minister the word in a ministry meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, some elders are very capable and have continued to hold their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Others do not have the capacity to do both and have dropped their jobs in order to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There should not be the thought that only certain things can be done by full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In regard to serving in the church, no distinction should be made between those who serve full time and those who serve while holding a job.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The only difference is how they maintain their livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some maintain a livelihood by holding a job to support themselves, others do so by looking to God for provision, and still others draw on their savings or inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the difference is not in regard to how they function, or serve, but in regard to how they maintain their livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should never regard the full-time serving ones as clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not even say that they are the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the church everyone is a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We simply have different ways of providing for our livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The responsible brothers in all the churches need to make this matter clear to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the church there is no clergy; moreover, the full-time serving ones are not clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A capable co-worker may function much and yet continue to hold a job.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, another co-worker, who has less capacity, may drop his job because he has received the Lord s commission and his daily necessities have been taken care of through an arrangement in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This has nothing to do with either brother s competence in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only difference between them is how they take care of their livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On my part, I do not know if one day the Lord will want me to take a job.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, if I take a job, it does not mean that I will stop serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should never think that if a person has a job, he does not need to serve anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Having a job or not having a job is not related to service but only to providing for one s living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In regard to serving the Lord we should not make a distinction between those who serve full time and those who hold a job.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The full-time serving ones should not have the attitude that they need to do everything because they serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, the working saints should not have the attitude that they do not need to do anything because others are serving full time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Both concepts are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moreover, the full-timers should not be given special or favorable treatment in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It seems that in some of the churches the full-timers are given a special position; this is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They should not have any priority or special position in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the church we may have different ways of taking care of our livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Being a doctor, working as a clerk, and engaging in business are all for the purpose of providing a livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Likewise, trusting in God s provision is also a means of caring for one s livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although there is a difference in the way saints earn a living, there is no difference between the saints in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In terms of service, all the saints should have an equal opportunity to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this regard, we are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the brothers and sisters should be clear about this.</S>
