   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE DIED FOR ALL,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THEREFORE ALL DIED Issue No. 14 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christ was incarnated, He included all flesh in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just as the act of one man, Adam, represents the acts of all mankind, in the same way, the work of one man, Christ, represents the work of all mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only after we have seen that Christ includes all mankind will we understand the meaning of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the one man, Adam, sinned, all men past and present also sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because Adam was the head of the human race, and all men were born of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same way, when Christ was justified, all men past and present were justified, because Christ is the Head of the new human race.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All men in the new human race are born of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hebrews 7 quotes one incident which illustrates this point.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to prove that the priesthood of Melchisedec was greater than that of the Levites, the apostle mentioned how Abraham paid tithes to Melchisedec and how Abraham received the blessing from Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This proves that Melchisedec was greater than the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How did he prove this?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him" v. 10 . We know that Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Levi is the great-grandson of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Abraham tithed and received the blessing, Levi was not yet born.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even his father and grandfather were not born.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Bible considers Abraham's tithing and receiving of the blessing as Levi's tithing and receiving of the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since Abraham is inferior to Melchisedec, Levi also has to be inferior to Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This fact explains why, when Adam sinned, all sinned, and when Christ was judged, all were judged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reason for this is that when Adam sinned, all men were already in Adam, and when Christ was judged, the life of all the regenerated sinners was already in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, when Christ was judged for man's sin, all those who believe in Him were also judged.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a result, all those who believe in Him need not be judged anymore.</S>
