   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In II Peter we have the sure Word, but in Revelation we have the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 3:1 says, "These things saith He that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The hand of Jesus not only holds the seven stars, but also the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that the seven Spirits are one with the seven stars, and the seven stars are one with the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have the living Word as the daystar rising within us and we are one with the seven Spirits, eventually we will become the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We not only have the star shining within us, but by looking to the star and following in the Spirit we become the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>EVERYONE A SHINING STAR</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord said unto Abraham, "I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore" Gen 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We Christians, the genuine believers, are the real children of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are the stars of the heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Jewish people, the physical descendants, are as the sand upon the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all must be the stars not only the leaders in the local churches, but everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Read Revelation chapters 2 and 3 again and you will realize that eventually all in the local churches should be the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What the Lord wrote to the seven angels was what He wrote to the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not a matter of teaching, knowledge, title, or position; it is absolutely a matter of shining.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to be the shining stars that people may find Christ through us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Come and see!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Just follow the star!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And where is the star?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hallelujah, the star is in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers and sisters, are we really shining?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must shine in our homes, on our jobs, in our neighborhoods, in the schools, on the campus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Don't teach people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just shine!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Don't preach so much.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just shine!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Shine!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Shine!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Shine!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The local churches should be full of shining stars.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let me illustrate a little more and apply what we have been saying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many times when you go to a believer or great teacher, you sense that they are so lacking in clarity and transparency.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You sense that with them there is no window, there is no light, they are opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That person may have all the knowledge of the Bible, but the more he talks with you, the more you feel imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes, however, perhaps not frequently, you come to a little brother, and when he speaks with you he simply says, "Hallelujah, praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But by those few words, something gets into you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more he speaks with you, the more you sense that all the clouds have vanished and something is shining.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because this dear little brother is a shining star.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no tag attached to him saying, "I am a heavenly star."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But when you meet him, you simply have the sense of shining.</S>
