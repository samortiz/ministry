   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord s resurrection proves that His death satisfied God s righteous requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since His death satisfied God, God raised Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His death paid our debt to God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the debt was paid, the proof of His payment required a receipt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the Lord died to pay our debt, we would have no proof of His payment without His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, we would not know whether His death satisfied God s righteous requirement as well as God Himself.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His resurrection declares that His death satisfied God s righteous requirement; thus, God can justify us according to His righteousness.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If Christ had not been raised, we would still be in our sins, because without His resurrection, we could not have received the life that delivers us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since Christ s resurrection caused us to obtain the life of deliverance, it has delivered us from sin.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The death of Christ dealt with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The resurrection of Christ delivered us from death, because Christ s resurrection gave us a life that cannot be held by death Acts 2:24 , a life that overcomes death and breaks the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who believe in Christ and have His life shall by no means die forever John 11:26 ; even if we should die, we shall live v. 25 .</S>
