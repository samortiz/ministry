   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The constitution of the Body of Christ is also by the transfusion of Christ in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This relates to the transcending power of Christ mentioned in Ephesians 1:19, which speaks of the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This power toward us is a fourfold power: resurrection power v. 20a , ascending power v. 20b , subjecting power v. 22a , and heading-up power v. 22b . This power raised Christ from the dead, seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenlies, subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All things being subjected under His feet means that they are under our feet because we are His organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God gave Christ to be the Head over all things to the church, which is His Body 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thank the Lord for such a constitution of the Body of Christ through the dispensing of the Triune God and by the transfusion of Christ in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Its Formation Being through the Baptism</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>of the Spirit in the Economical Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen what the Body of Christ is and also how the Body of Christ is constituted with the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now we need to see how the Body of Christ was formed through the baptism of the Spirit in the economical Trinity.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was incarnated as a man and passed through crucifixion and resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In John 20 the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples in resurrection and breathed into them, saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" v. 22 . He breathed Himself as the Spirit into them to impart Himself as life into them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then He told them to stay in Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high Luke 24:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is concerning the outpouring of the Spirit as the power from on high and is different from the Spirit of life breathed into the disciples on the day of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Fifty days after Christ's resurrection, on the day of Pentecost, the economical Spirit of the ascension power was poured out upon the disciples.</S>
