Austin-Sparks. After the message, others would usually ask about the message just given. But on my way home with this brother, I did not ask him anything. In the end, he opened his mouth. He felt that Mr. Sparks was too strong in his will. I told him that my will was also quite strong. This leader, Mr. Baker, asked, "How then are you able to get along with him?" No doubt those who are outwardly strong in their will do not easily get along with others. But this brother did not realize that we are one because of our inner man; it is not because of our outer will. Today, in order for our inner man to match our outer man, our inner man must grow. When the inner man grows, it can control the outer man.</P><P>Some people are too strong in their minds. Their minds need to come under the control of the inner man. I have read the New Testament a few hundred times. Although I cannot say that I have read it more times than everyone else, I can at least say that I have read it more than many people. I could find over one hundred passages that contradict each other. However, I have not done this because my mind has been under the control of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>If we want our spiritual life to be well-tempered, we need to attune our condition to a proper balance. We must neither be too much nor be too short. This can be compared to shooting a pinball machine; there are pins to the left and to the right, and the balls must be directed at the optimum angle before they can score. There are many pitfalls in our spiritual journey; our mind, emotion, and will can all become our hindrances. If we are too much or too short, we fall into danger.</P><P>Everything depends on God's mercy. Before I was saved, I planned to go to America. Had I left two months earlier, I would not have met Sister Dora Yu, and I might never have been saved. Even if I were given the chance later, I might not have believed. It was God's mercy that I met Miss Dora Yu at that time. It was neither too early nor too late.</P><P>Only God can do things in just the right amount. We are prone to speak either too much or not enough. No one can preach a message that will meet everyone's need. Even the apostle Paul and the apostle Peter faced the same problem. When words come out of a person's mouth, it is difficult for the words to come out just right. This is why it is easy for people to misunderstand words.</P><P>Only God can bring man to a state of true humiliation. Sometimes a little cross and a little dealing make a person proud instead of humble. Only severe crosses and severe dealings will make a person humble.</P><P>Some people are too spiritual; they think that the Lord dwells only in our spirit. But Ephesians 3 says that by faith Christ dwells in our hearts. He dwells not only in our spirit, but in our hearts also. This is something that a person can feel. John 15 says that Christ abides in the believers, but it does not say that Christ abides in our hearts. Only Ephesians 3 mentions Christ dwelling in our hearts. Some people are too spiritual. They think that the heart does not mean much. However, many of the Psalms mention the heart. In order to be tempered in spiritual matters, we need to pay attention not only to the spirit, but to our hearts as well.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY OF THE CHURCH&#151;LOOKING TO GOD'S MERCY</H2><P>The way of the church during the past two thousand years is a way of looking to the mercy of God. Only God's mercy can temper us. I have often told the young people that they may have to wait for five years before they will realize that everything is of God's mercy. On the average, a person has one hundred forty thousand hairs. The Bible says that God has numbered every one of our hairs. He knows us more than we know ourselves. When God wants to save us, we are saved. If God does not show mercy on us, no one can be saved. Once D. L. Moody was preaching the gospel, and a lady was about to be saved. Just then an umbrella fell; it caused a distraction, and in the end the lady was not saved. Whether or not a man can be saved is not the responsibility of the preacher. The responsibility of the preacher is simply to present the way to others. Only God's mercy can put a person on the way. It is God's work that puts a person on the way. It is also God Himself who takes men on, on the way.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
