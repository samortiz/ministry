   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MUTUAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to realize that the life we received is perfect but not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has not given us a complete life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our life is one that depends on other lives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The life we received from Christ is a mutual life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not independent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have to rely on you, and you have to rely on me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot live without each other.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we need the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some institutions in the world have their attached departments, and some colleges have attached schools.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the same sense, we Christians are attached one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We live by attaching to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From the first day on we have to learn not to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to be part of the church and live with other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, to come into the church does not mean to be converted from being an unbeliever to a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It means that those who are already Christians should not be independent; rather, they should be related to others in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>NOT AN EASY MATTER</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of which church then should we be a part?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the old days, this was not a big problem because there was only one church in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But today the matter has become very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Presently, merely the organized and sizable denominations number at least fifteen hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In some cities you can easily name a hundred organizations that call themselves a church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a Christian it is not easy to choose one out of the fifteen hundred without being somewhat swayed by others' influence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE WORD OF GOD GIVES THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Due to the confusion, the problem of identifying oneself with a church is a very difficult one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet if you would go according to the Word of God and look at the matter from the biblical point of view, there is still a way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Word of God has a clear revelation concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It shows us clearly of which church we should be a part.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we have to know a little more about the divisions in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only then will we know what God is after.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we have the discernment, we will know which church is according to the Word of God.</S>
