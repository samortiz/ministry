 <p><strong>WEEK 9 &mdash; DAY 1</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Acts 10:36 ...Announcing the gospel of peace through Jesus Christ (this One is Lord of all).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt. 1:23 &ldquo;...They shall call His name Emmanuel&rdquo; (which is translated, God with us).</strong></p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ</h2>
<p>In order for us to enjoy God&rsquo;s dispensing, we need to consider all the aspects of who Christ is and what Christ is.<sup>39</sup> When speaking about Christ, whether it be in what He is, in what He has accomplished, in His person, in His work, or in any other aspect, the Bible always shows us that He is all-inclusive and infinite.<sup>40</sup> What He is, is so much and so limitless. That is why even though the Bible uses sixty-six books to depict Him, it still cannot describe Him fully.<sup>41</sup> [Therefore, for our purpose here we shall only be able to cover some of Christ&rsquo;s titles and some of the many aspects of His person.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">Lord</h2>
<p>Lord, in Greek <em>Kurios,</em> denotes Jesus Christ as the Lord of all, who possesses all (John 20:28; Acts 2:36; 10:36). It is often used as a substitute for the title Jehovah in the Old Testament, as in Mark 1:3. Mark 1:3 quotes the word of the Old Testament in Isaiah 40:3. In the word of the Old Testament, it was Jehovah. In the quotation in the New Testament, it becomes the Lord. This indicates that the Lord in the New Testament is a substitute for Jehovah. Another Greek word, <em>Despotes,</em> is used to denote either God or the Lord Jesus as the Master of the slaves (Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24; Rev. 6:10; Jude 4; 2 Pet. 2:1; cf. 1 Tim. 6:1-2). In the Old Testament the Master of the slaves is called <em>Adonai,</em> but in the New Testament, in the Greek, He is called <em>Despotes.</em><sup>42</sup> Furthermore, in the New Testament &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; is a divine title of the Triune God. Hence, the Lord is a title not only of the Lord Jesus Himself as the Son of God but also a title of the Triune God.<sup>43</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">Jesus</h2>
<p>The name Jesus was given by God. The angel Gabriel told Mary that the child she would conceive was to be called Jesus (Luke 1:31). Later, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph and also told him to call the child Jesus (Matt. 1:21). Hence, &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; was a God-given name.</p>
<p>Luke 1:31 says, &ldquo;Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus.&rdquo; Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua (Num. 13:16), which means <em>Jehovah the Savior,</em> or <em>the salvation of Jehovah.</em> Therefore, Jesus is not only a man but also Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation.<sup>44</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ</h2>
<p>Christ, in Greek <em>Christos</em> (Matt. 1:16b), equals <em>Messiah</em> in Hebrew (John 1:41; Dan. 9:26). Both of these terms mean the anointed One (Psa. 2:2). Christ is God&rsquo;s anointed One. <em>Christ</em> is a title of commission. To be anointed means to be appointed by God to be His Christ, to be His anointed One, for the accomplishing of His eternal economy (Luke 4:18-19). The anointed One of God accomplishes God&rsquo;s economy in His salvation. In the New Testament the two titles, Jesus and Christ, are often used as a compound title, either Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus (Matt. 1:1a, 18a; 1 Tim. 1:15-16).<sup>45</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">Emmanuel</h2>
<p>Jesus was the name given by God, while Emmanuel, meaning God with us, was the name called by man. Jesus the Savior is God with us. God is He, and He is God incarnated to dwell among us (John 1:14). He is not only God but God with us. Without Him we cannot meet God, for He is God. Without Him we cannot find God, for He is God incarnate.</p>
<p>According to Matthew 18:20, whenever we are gathered together into the name of Jesus, He is with us. This is Emmanuel, God with us. The presence of Jesus in our gatherings is actually God with us.<sup>46</sup></p>
