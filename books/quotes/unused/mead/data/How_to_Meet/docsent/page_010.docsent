   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MEETING TO WORSHIP HIM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Matthew 28 we read that when they saw the Lord Jesus on the mountain, immediately they worshipped Him Matt 28:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we meet with the Lord in His resurrection, we meet on one hand as His very brothers, but on the other hand we have to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not just to greet Him, not just to hail Him as did His disciples, but to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This does not mean that we need to kneel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may kneel or we may not kneel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To worship Him means to adore and exalt Him as the very Lord in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the situation permits us to kneel, that is good; but many times it is not so convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In any case, it is not a matter of outward forms, but absolutely of the inward spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to adore and exalt Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to praise Him, sometimes even with shouting Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus is the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would say that to shout in this way is much better than kneeling in deadly quietness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The worship I am speaking of is not the dead worship of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I tell you, if a young sister could shout in the meeting, Jesus is my Lord, Hallelujah! that would be marvelous worship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is real and living worship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not a religious performance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is in the Spirit exalting, adoring, and magnifying the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not bring that old, dead, religious way of worshipping into the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must keep ourselves so living in the matter of worshipping the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>MEETING TO BE BREATHED UPON BY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John chapter twenty we read that when the Lord Jesus met with His disciples, He breathed upon them v. 22 . Oh, how we need the Lord to breathe upon us when we meet together! I have heard the saints pray many times before they have come to the meeting: O Lord, give us a good speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lord, You know Your church today needs sound teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe that some of you in the past have prayed in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we must pray, Lord, we need Thy breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This day, in the day of Your resurrection, breathe upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers and sisters, we do not need so much teaching, but we do need the breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So many teachings kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is the Lord breathing upon us that makes us alive; it is the breathing that gives life and imparts Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all have to pray, Lord, in our meetings we need Thy breathing much more than any kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Give us a gracious visitation, Lord, and breathe upon us; breathe upon every one who comes to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to pray in this way before every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Forget about the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Take the way the Lord set before us by meeting with His disciples after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps in your entire Christian life you have never heard anyone speak about coming to a meeting to be breathed upon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But it is so clearly mentioned in John chapter twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the first evening after His resurrection, the Lord came to His disciples, and the main thing He did was to breathe upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was their basic need, and this also is our basic need.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, this is a basic principle for our meeting together with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are we willing to receive His breathing?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This matter of breathing is of two aspects: He breathes out and we breathe in; He exhales and we inhale.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we shut ourselves, though He breathes upon us, we get nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must learn to open ourselves to Him and say, Lord, we are not just opening our listening ears or our understanding minds, we are opening our receiving spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our ears are open to Thee, our mind is open to Thee, and even the more, our spirit is open to Thy breathing, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>O Lord, breathe Thyself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Regardless of whether we understand or not, O Lord, breathe upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We would like to receive something of Thyself deeply within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to prepare ourselves for the meetings in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A radical change is needed to rid ourselves of the old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even while we are in the meeting we need to say, O Lord, I am here open to Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I only want to breathe in Thyself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This really refreshes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We really enjoy pray-reading the Word together in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is much better than preaching or teaching, because it includes breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we pray-read the Word, we just breathe the Lord Jesus into us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have received some letters recently from some in a distant land who recently became acquainted with pray-reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They practiced it and were much impressed, but they wrote expressing the fear that they were not practicing it correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, I believe they need not be concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All they need is simply to open themselves to the Word and breathe it in. It is the exercising of our spirit to inhale what the Lord exhales.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the breathing upon us of the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When He came to His disciples after His resurrection, He came as the life-giving Spirit and breathed upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is doing the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we are open to Him, He is breathing out and we are breathing in. This is one of the main principles of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all need to help the new ones when we come together to give the Lord an opening to breathe something of Himself into them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We come together not to receive some teaching, but to be breathed upon by the Lord Jesus to take in the Lord Jesus by breathing.</S>
