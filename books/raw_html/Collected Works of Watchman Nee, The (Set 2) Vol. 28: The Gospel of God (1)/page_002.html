<h1 class="msg">PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION</h1><p>As has become manifest to Christian readers throughout the earth, Brother Watchman Nee was especially entrusted by the Lord with the burden to help the believers in the truth of God's full salvation. In the spring of 1937 Brother Nee delivered a series of twenty-six messages on the basic truths of the gospel of God to the church in Shanghai, China. These messages compose the contents of Volumes 28 and 29 in The Collected Works. The matters covered are comprehensive, ranging from man's sinful condition before salvation to his destiny in the coming age. In Volume 28, Brother Nee presents the particulars of God's salvation, that is, man's sins; God's love, grace, and mercy; the nature of grace; the function of the law and God's righteousness; the work of Christ and of the Holy Spirit in God's salvation; and faith as the way of salvation. In Volume 29, Brother Nee covers in detail the issues of eternal security of salvation and God's way of dealing with the believers' sins both in this age and in the age to come. For both issues Brother Nee presents persuasive responses from the Scriptures to various understandings current among Christians.</p><p>The messages in this series were spoken by Brother Nee in Chinese and were transcribed by hand as they were being given. The handwritten notes have been translated into English and edited as necessary. As much as possible, the spoken nature of the messages has been preserved. Many of the illustrations Brother Nee used were drawn from his life in China at the time.</p><p>These messages demonstrate the Lord's commission to our brother and His equipping of him with the revelation in His Word. May the Lord richly bless all who read and see these truths released by the Lord through our brother.</p>
