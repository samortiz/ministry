THE NEW WAY OF GOSPEL PREACHING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Dropping the Old Way</h2>
<p>I may be taking the lead to speak in a visiting team, but I could never forget my past or my old way of preaching. I may not even want to drop the old way. I realize that our new contact is very stubborn, so my way is to give him a personal testimony of something miraculous that happened to me many years ago. This may be very good, but it is old. In Christianity people always like to hear messages related to two things&mdash;blessing and happiness. Many sermons in today&rsquo;s Christianity are centered on these two things. Some may say that you need to believe in Jesus because if you believe in Him you will have many blessings: your business will make more money, you will be promoted, and your health will always be strong. These are earthly blessings. Eventually you will always be happy. Of course, they would also tell people that they are sinners and that Jesus died on the cross, resurrected, and can save them because He is powerful. Then He can give you blessings and happiness. We cannot say that this kind of preaching is absolutely not scriptural. But strictly speaking, it is against the biblical New Testament way and is too natural.</p>
<p>In the Scripture reading, two portions from John are quoted that show the biblical way. While Jesus was living on the earth, He performed many miracles, but John uses the word signs instead of miracles. John 2 tells us that the Lord Jesus would not entrust Himself to the persons who believed in His name because of the signs which He did (vv. 23-24). The Lord has no confidence, no trust, in those who believe because of miracles. The following chapter, chapter three, begins with the word &ldquo;but.&rdquo; &ldquo;But&rdquo; shows us a contrast. Many believed in the Lord because they saw the miracles, yet the Lord would not commit Himself to them. Then the following chapter says, &ldquo;But there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus&rdquo; (3:1). The case of Nicodemus differs from the cases in the foregoing verses, 2:23-25. Nicodemus came to Jesus not because he saw the miracles, so the Lord went further, went deeper, to touch the inner life, to touch regeneration.</p>
<p>Many of us think that if we talk about deeper things, people will not understand us. But in the Lord&rsquo;s talk with Nicodemus, He talked about regeneration. Throughout the entire Old Testament, there was not such a thing as regeneration. Nicodemus had never heard this. He even thought that to be born again was to go back to his mother&rsquo;s womb (3:4). But the Lord told him, &ldquo;You must be born anew&rdquo; (v. 7), born of water and the Spirit (v. 5). He told Nicodemus that he had to be born in his spirit by the Spirit (v. 6). All these were new points to this seeker. Do you believe that Nicodemus fully understood the Lord? Then the Lord referred Nicodemus to the brass serpent in Numbers 21&mdash;&ldquo;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up&rdquo; (John 3:14). All these are new points. But whether Nicodemus understood them or not, eventually he received what the Lord preached. He did not receive any miracle, any sign, but he received regeneration; he was born of water and the Spirit. He received the Lord Jesus as the brass serpent, and he received the eternal life (3:15). The eternal life was a great mystery at that time. Although this also was an altogether new item, the Lord Jesus preached the gospel in this way. This is a wonderful example of the new way, the new preaching. After having been in this line of preaching the gospel for so many years, I found out that the old way and the old preaching really will not work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Using the Booklets</h2>
<p>We have recently published a little booklet entitled <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> The points in this booklet with the thought of four keys to unlock the mystery of human life is altogether new. The way the gospel is presented in this booklet is new, the preaching is new, and the thought is new. When this booklet was put out, it was very much used by the Holy Spirit, especially in Taipei. Quite close to ten thousand in Taipei were saved and baptized through this booklet. It has been proven that the Lord&rsquo;s blessing is on the use of this booklet. It is so easy to get people saved by using it. To use <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> is the new way of preaching the gospel. We should not preach the gospel according to our natural thought. You may contact a man whom you feel is quite stubborn, so you will give him a testimony to convince him. This is to preach in the old, natural way. You may come across someone whom you feel needs more understanding, so you preach more to him. To some extent he may argue with you and you would do your best to debate with him. According to my knowledge and observation, this way never works.</p>
<p>The more you talk, the more people would not believe or be convinced. Salesmen are taught not to speak their own word and not to talk too long. If a person is not so promising, leave him in a polite way, hoping that at another time he will be promising. Come back another day. Do not stay there for forty minutes or an hour to explain or to convince him. The more you explain, the more you speak, the more you try to convince him, the more he would not be convinced. I have heard of one salesman who makes an outstanding commission by selling things through the telephone. His secret is this&mdash;every call should not exceed three minutes. He has the ability to discern within three minutes whether the one to whom he is talking is promising or not. If not, he politely and quickly closes the conversation, hoping for a sale the next time. Even in the preaching of the gospel it works in this way&mdash;the more you talk, the more you drive people away from you. If your talk with someone does not work so well within fifteen minutes, close the conversation politely and say, &ldquo;Let us come together another time.&rdquo; Quite often a man would not be open in this time, but the next time he will be open. In this time he would not believe, but in another time he would believe.</p>
<p>You do not need to give long testimonies. You do not need to argue, debate, or give long explanations and definitions; all this will not work. The new way we have found is to use the booklets we have published because the booklets were written with a certain goal, with a certain purpose. Our booklets are short and are always on life, not on blessings or happiness. You have to learn to use the booklets to go directly to a person&rsquo;s spirit.</p>
<p>You may contact a man who tells you that he is not clear about the Bible and that he wants to study the Bible more before he will believe. What should you do? Or he may even say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Christianity and I don&rsquo;t believe that Jesus is the Son of God.&rdquo; What would you say? Do not argue with him. Just open the booklets, especially <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> Maybe you would ask him to read the page on the parts of man with the three circles (page 5). This way has been tested. Many have expressed their different opinions concerning Christianity and have said they would not believe in the Lord. Our brothers and sisters would not care for what they would say. Regardless of what they would say, they would still ask this person to read a page of <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em></p>
<p>Many times these dissenters at a certain point would say, &ldquo;This is very good.&rdquo; Once &ldquo;very good&rdquo; came out of their mouth, immediately the brothers would stop talking and say, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pray.&rdquo; When a man prays, his prayer will lead him into his spirit. In prayer, his spirit is touched and exercised and in his spirit he meets God the Spirit. You do not need to argue with the person. You do not need to convince him that what you believe is right and what he believes is wrong. This is very awkward and not wise. You need to go directly to his spirit. Very rarely would a dissenter, an unbelieving one, believe after your argument. We must take the straight way to directly touch the new contact&rsquo;s spirit. This is the way from the very beginning to bring them to the Lord through the spirit and to know the way of life.</p>
<p>In John 6 the Lord Jesus fed five thousand. The next day many came back seeking after Him. Then the Lord told them, &ldquo;Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides to eternal life, which the Son of Man shall give you&rdquo; (v. 27). The Lord Jesus turned them from the miracles, from the signs, to the inner life. We may think that the Lord&rsquo;s talk was too high, too deep, too profound. He spoke about the eternal life, the bread out of heaven (6:32), the living bread (v. 51), the bread of life (v. 48), and the bread of God (v. 33). To some His word in John 6 was too hard (v. 60), but a good number of those who heard it received His word. We have to learn to preach our gospel, not along the line of happiness or blessings, but always along the line of life by touching a person&rsquo;s spirit. You do not need to deal so much with their understanding, but turn them from their mind to their spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The New Way to Carry Out the Increase and Spread of the Church &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
