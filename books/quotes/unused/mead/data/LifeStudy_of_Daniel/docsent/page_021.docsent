   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NEBUCHADNEZZAR BLESSING THE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABED-NEGO</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nebuchadnezzar responded and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent His angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him and changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own God" v. 28 . The three young overcomers did not simply frustrate the king's word they changed it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead of caring for Nebuchadnezzar's word, they changed it in nature and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god other than their own God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nebuchadnezzar went on to make a decree that any people, nation, or language that spoke something offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego should be cut into pieces and their houses should be made a dunghill, because there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way v. 29 . Then the king caused the three young overcomers to prosper in the province of Babylon v. 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The three young overcomers gained the victory over the seduction of idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The whole universe saw their rejection of that devilish worship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, God could boast to Satan that even in his territory, He had a people worshipping Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They did not care for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, in this dark age, everything seems to be discouraging.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But there is still a group of overcomers to stand against the tide and to carry out God's worship, testimony, and interest on earth.</S>
