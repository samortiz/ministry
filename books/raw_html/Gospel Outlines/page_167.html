<h1 class="title">THE SACRIFICE OF LOVE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gal. 2:20</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The love of Christ
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ loved us, so He left heaven and the throne to be born in this world as a lowly person.</li>
	<li>Christ loved us, so He passed through thirty-three years of human sufferings.</li>
	<li>Christ loved us, so He gave Himself up at the cross; that is, He gave up His life through death.</li>
	<li>Very few lay down their lives for others, although some might die for a good man, or friends. Yet Christ laid down His life for us, even though we were His enemies. This love is a surpassing love (Rom. 5:7-8, 10).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The intention of Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Not only to suffer and die for us, but to take away our sins and redeem us.</li>
	<li>Not only to satisfy our need, but to fulfill God&rsquo;s requirement.</li>
	<li>Not only to make us complete, but to accomplish God&rsquo;s means of salvation.</li>
	<li>His sacrifice was that we might partake of God and all He has.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to receive the love of Christ<br />
