         <h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL VISION OF<br />
THE TWO BEGINNING AND TWO ENDING<br />
CHAPTERS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God Wanting to Gain a Builded Corporate Man</h2>
<p>Genesis 1&mdash;2 and Revelation 21&mdash;22, the beginning and ending of the Bible, present a picture of God&rsquo;s intention. God&rsquo;s intention was beginning to be carried out in Genesis 1 and 2 when the serpent, God&rsquo;s adversary, came in chapter 3. After the serpent came in, there were many efforts to undermine God&rsquo;s intention, but God never gave up on His intention and goal. Everything that God&rsquo;s adversary, Satan, does is aimed at undermining God&rsquo;s intention and goal. The serpent&rsquo;s injecting sin into man, which resulted in death in man, was aimed at destroying God&rsquo;s goal, God&rsquo;s desire for a vessel to contain Him. However, God did not stop working and even became flesh in order to deal with the serpent, to deal with man&rsquo;s sin brought in by the serpent, and to deal with the death brought in by sin. God intends to accomplish His desire. Ultimately, the problems related to Satan, sin, and death will be resolved, and the Son of God and the righteousness and life that He brings will gain the full victory. Now God has entered into men of clay with His nature of gold so that they can be transformed into pearls and precious stones. Their earthy element will be completely transformed, and they will be gold, pearls, and precious stones. God is within us to be our life, to live in us, and to be expressed through us. We can shine forth God, express Him in His image, and represent Him with His dominion.</p>
<p>This picture gives a clear impression that there is no room for individuals. The ultimate issue of God&rsquo;s desire is that there would be one body, one corporate entity, not many individuals. He does not want many transformed individuals but instead wants one transformed and built-up corporate entity. At the end of Genesis 2, God built one woman. At the end of the whole Bible, the issue of God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages is one city, and this city is also one woman. Hence, the ultimate issue of God&rsquo;s work is one building. Therefore, in this work there is no room for individuals. Rather, the many are part of one corporate entity. In order to have the building, we, as men of clay, need to receive God as life. After the divine life enters into us, through its flowing and through transformation, pearls and precious stones are produced. However, it is not sufficient for these precious materials to be scattered. Eventually, these materials need to be built up. This is the central vision of the Bible. This central vision includes the work of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in us.</p>
<p>It is very good that we preach the gospel to people so that they can receive God&rsquo;s life. It is also good that we help new believers learn to let the Holy Spirit do a transforming work within them so that they may advance and grow before God. However, this is not God&rsquo;s final goal. God&rsquo;s final goal is for the gold, pearls, and precious stones, the transformed people, to be built up as one entity. These transformed people include God&rsquo;s elect, represented by the twelve tribes of Israel in the Old Testament, and the believers, represented by the twelve apostles in the New Testament. This is the ultimate vision of the Bible. God will not arrive at His goal merely by our earthy nature being changed to gold, pearls, and precious stones. There is still a need for these materials to be built up. Similarly, in terms of our work, our leading people to be saved, to love the Lord, and to be transformed into gold, pearls, and precious stones do not achieve God&rsquo;s goal. That is merely the work of the first half of Genesis 2; it is not the work of building the woman in the second half of chapter 2. The gold, pearls, and precious stones need to be built up into a woman.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Work of the Apostles Being<br />
for the Building of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians was written by the apostle Paul according to the will of God. In chapter 1 Paul says that the church is the Body of Christ (vv. 22-23) and in chapter 4 that God &ldquo;gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ&rdquo; (vv. 11-12). According to Paul, apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are for the building up of the Body of Christ. In 2:22, concerning the church being the dwelling place of God, Paul says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; In verses 24 and 25 of chapter 5 Paul speaks of the church being the counterpart and wife of Christ. Bible expositors recognize that the book of Ephesians is concerning the church and that the church is the Body of Christ, the dwelling place of God, and the counterpart of Christ. However, it is difficult to find books or messages in Christianity concerning the building up of the church. At most, we can find some literature that refers to the church as an aggregate of all the saved ones, but there is no explanation as to how this aggregate comes into being.</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
