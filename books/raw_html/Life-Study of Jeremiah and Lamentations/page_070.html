<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. JEHOVAH'S MESSAGE<br>THROUGH JEREMIAH THE PROPHET<br>TO THE PUNISHED ISRAEL (ACTUALLY JUDAH)<br>CONCERNING THEIR DROUGHT</H2><P>In 14:1-6 we have Jehovah's message through Jeremiah the prophet to the punished Israel (actually Judah) concerning their drought. God asked Jeremiah to tell His people that He would be sending a drought upon them, and in these verses we have Jeremiah's description of the suffering of Israel during this time of drought.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Judah Mourning and Her Gates Languishing</H2><P>According to verse 2, Judah mourns, and her gates languish. In black garments they mourn on the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem goes up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Servants Finding No Water in the Cisterns<br>and Returning with Their Vessels Empty</H2><P>The nobles, those of the upper class, send their servants for water. The servants come to the cisterns and find no water. They return with their vessels empty; they are ashamed and confounded and cover their heads (v. 3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Farmers Being Ashamed<br>and Covering Their Heads</H2><P>There has been no rain on the earth. Because the ground is cracked from the lack of rain, the farmers are ashamed and cover their heads (v. 4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Hind in the Field<br>Giving Birth and Abandoning Its Young</H2><P>Even the hind in the field gives birth and abandons its young because there is no grass (v. 5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. There Being No Herbage</H2><P>The wild asses stand on the bare heights. They pant after the wind like jackals, and their eyes fail, for there is no herbage (v. 6).</P>
