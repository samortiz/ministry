   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN GOD'S AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH Date: June 23, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kuling Mountain</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past few days we touched on the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we will "hit home" on this subject: God's authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Two falls occurred in this universe, and both have great repercussions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, there was the fall of the angels; second, there was the fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In both cases God's authority was overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although both the angels and man fell, God did not withdraw His authority in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God can withdraw His presence, but He will never withdraw His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He does not compromise His authority with anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where His authority is, there His presence is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When He withdraws His authority, He withdraws His presence as well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fall of the angels did not cause Him to turn away; He did not give up His creation as a result of the angels' fall.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nor did man's fall turn Him away.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not give up the man whom He created.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is still in control of this world, and He is still upholding the system of authority through government, family, and other human relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of course, none of the authorities within these relationships can be compared with the authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God asserts Himself through asserting His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where authority is, God's presence can be found.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In fact, the best way to prove God's existence or presence is through the demonstration of His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE CHURCH BEING THE PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>WHERE GOD'S AUTHORITY IS MAINTAINED</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I would like the brothers and sisters to know one thing: Even though God has not withdrawn His authority, and even though His authority is still felt throughout the world and the universe, man daily trespasses against this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every day we find lawlessness operating on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every day man is under rebellion, plotting against God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition, fallen angels, evil spirits, and Satan himself offend God's authority daily.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such a situation cannot go on forever; God's authority cannot be challenged forever.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to His desire, plan, and work, God will establish a kingdom on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within the realm of this kingdom, His authority will rule.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every person within this realm will submit to His authority; no one will trespass it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This realm defines the kingdom of the heavens, that is, the kingdom of God, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God intends to bring order into the chaotic world and chaotic universe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Within the realm of the church, there should be submission everywhere; everything should be under God's almighty rule and should be joined to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the kingdom of the heavens, and it is here that God establishes His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How great the responsibility of the church is!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the midst of chaos and rebellion, God is upholding His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the church joins in this rebellion, God will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the past few days we have seen Israel's rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have seen how the children of Israel rebelled against Moses and Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By the time of Judges, the people of Israel were in a state of total collapse and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then God established the kingdom of Israel, asserting His authority through David.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even before David died, however, rebellion had already broken out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After Solomon passed away, the rebellion grew worse.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the time of Rehoboam's idolatry to the dividing of the northern and southern kingdoms, the people were in constant rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This rebellion continued until the time of their captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His attempt to establish authority among the Israelites failed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Four hundred years later, starting with John the Baptist, the kingdom of the heavens was preached, and those who were violent took it by force.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The prophecies of the prophets and the law ended with John Matt 11:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First God sent Elijah, and then He sent His own Son to be a model of obedience to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After this God began to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church should continue the line of obedience; it should be a vessel of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet the church failed; it did not fully obey God's authority nor fully submit to His direct will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God has yet to recover His authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In spite of this, God's will must go on; it must go on until it reaches perfection as recorded in Ephesians 4 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord has to do great things in the church in the end times.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Otherwise, a glorious church will not be ready for God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A man has to touch God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He must not fight against any authority, and he must not have a spirit of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the way to serve God according to the divine principle.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Unless one serves this way, his work, preaching, and service will be worthless because he will be operating according to Satan's principle.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This matter is too crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Perhaps some among us will not be able to take this word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today I am only touching the subject briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is the kingdom, and what is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The church as the kingdom is a group of people who uphold God's authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God's authority is established in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church is the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If the church rebels against God's authority, His authority will never be established.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Let me give an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When General Chiang Kai-shek had the thought of unifying China, he first established the Whampoa Military Academy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Through it he trained an army and unified the country.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What would have happened if the academy had turned against him before he was able to complete the unification?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The unification plan would have collapsed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God's will begins with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Through the church He establishes His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>According to God's plan, His authority is established directly and indirectly through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>One day the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdom of our Lord and our Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If the church rebels and fails to be a testimony of obedience, God's plan will be totally frustrated.</S>
