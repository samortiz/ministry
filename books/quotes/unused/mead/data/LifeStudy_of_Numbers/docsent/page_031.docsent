   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Cleansed on the Seventh Day</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Defilement Caused by the Sudden Death</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>of One beside Him</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the head of a Nazarite's separation was defiled by the sudden death of one beside him, he was to be cleansed on the seventh day the last day of his separation Acts 21:27 by shaving his head Num 6:9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that if we are defiled by some unexpected deadness, we should be cleansed by reseparating ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Humanly speaking, it would not be the fault of a Nazarite if one beside him died suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, such a sudden death would defile the Nazarite, and the Nazarite was held responsible for this defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today we are living among others, and we cannot predict when, spiritually speaking, someone will die beside us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are defiled by unexpected deadness, we need to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to be cleansed by reseparating ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not realize how dirty and defiling death is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We consider sin to be very defiling, yet God hates death much more than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the church life, sin may come in to defile the church and damage the saints, but more often we are defiled by death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Death is something hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Often death is right beside us, yet we have no consciousness of it or feeling concerning it and become defiled by it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How can we know that we have been defiled by death?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know this by having a sense, or feeling, of deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sin brings in condemnation, which affects our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, death is not a matter of condemnation, not something that affects our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, death is a matter that deadens us and makes us dead.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Often when you come to a meeting, you receive a supply of life and are enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes, however, when you get home from a meeting, you feel deadened, but you do not know why.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You sense no condemnation in your conscience, but there is a killing going on within you that makes you dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Your spirit is weak and dull.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are "down" and cannot rise up, and you cannot pray for some days.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You did not know it, but in that particular meeting you received some killing; you were deadened by some kind of death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As those who are absolutely and utterly for God, we must avoid earthly pleasure and the influence of death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is easy to abstain from earthly pleasure, but it is not easy to sense that we are near someone who is spiritually dead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, if we are living in the Spirit in every way, when we come to a meeting, we may immediately have the sense that deadness is there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may realize not only that the meeting is low and slow but that in the meeting there is deadness hidden beneath the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At such a time we need to pray very much to counter that deadening situation: "Lord, cover me with Your blood against any deadening, against any spiritual deadness."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must fight against deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Early in the church life in my hometown we were on a church life honeymoon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everything was new and fresh, and it was difficult to sense any deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>About a year later, I left my job, became full-time, and moved to Shanghai to be with Brother Nee in the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church in Shanghai had a considerable history and had passed through many troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, the church was rather old.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although I was at the center of the work and could have come to know the situation there, I learned not to know anything, for the more we know, the more we are deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Most of the talk in the church life is not related to sinful things but is related to death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In some of the meetings I was enlivened, but sometimes I had the feeling of being dead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It seemed that the longer I sat in the meeting, the more I became deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I wanted to pray, but I was not able to utter anything in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I was under the killing of death, and my spirit could not rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later, I talked to some older, more experienced ones, and I learned a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you come to a meeting, you need to sense whether there is any deadness there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You should not do this purposely, as if you were attending the meeting as an inspector.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the contrary, you should be a person who is able to sense the presence of death in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If death is present, you should be the first to pray, "Lord, cover this meeting with Your prevailing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Under this blood we participate in the divine life."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Exercise your spirit strongly against the deadness in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then as you sit in the meeting you will be protected.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is part of the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The churches in the United States have an extensive background and history.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because of the background and the present situation, there are many elements that have brought in death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I believe that this is the reason for the gradual decline in attendance at the prayer meeting in many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hidden deadness can cause the prayer meeting to become dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to fight against death and its effects.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As Nazarites, we must learn to avoid deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can easily avoid the deadness caused by the death of a blood relative, for that kind of death is apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not easy, however, to avoid the unexpected death of someone near us, because that kind of death is often hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we must be those who are full of life, which is "anti-death."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This depends on how much we exercise our spirit to pray, not in a general way but with a prayer that fights against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sin is of Satan John 8:44 , who is also the source of death Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>With the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, there is evil; however, the result of partaking of this tree is not evil it is death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we eat of the tree of life, the result is life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the church life we must constantly fight against death.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For example, if in the prayer meeting death makes it difficult for us to pray, we need to fight against death and its influence.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As Nazarites we must abstain from earthly pleasure, remain under the headship of the Lord, and learn to fight against death.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Death is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Society is filled with the germs of death.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Because these germs are even in the church life, we need to pray daily, hourly, fighting against death, the last enemy of God 1 Cor 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not think that the Nazarites are not for fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Nazarites are numbered for the formation of God's army.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They are very vigilant, full of feeling for the war against death.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In every church there is the need of the sense, the consciousness, of death so that we may fight against it.</S>
