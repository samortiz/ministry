   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Brought Back to the Rule of the Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we are fallen under human government, still needing others to govern us at school, at home, and in our city, we are fallen to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's salvation comes to deliver us from human government to self government.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A genuine Christian should not need this kind of human government.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a student still needs the government of the school, he is either not saved or not saved properly and adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If one has been saved adequately, there is no need for this kind of human government, because he has been saved back to his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the West Coast to the East Coast everyone is afraid of getting a ticket from the police.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do we Christians need to be patrolled by the police?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not, because we have been delivered from human government back to the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There should be no need for human government to rule us, because we are under the government of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Conscience Being the Bridge to the Presence of God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that now you can see the importance of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, we must realize that the conscience is not the ultimate goal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The conscience is only a bridge to the ultimate goal, which is the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to get on the bridge and pass through to reach the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot believe that a brother who does not have a proper conscience can be governed by the Lord directly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are not pure in our conscience, if our conscience is not void of offense, it is very hard to live in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have an offense on our conscience, a certain kind of accusation, how can we be in the presence of God?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If this is our case, we must get back into the presence of God through our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be in the presence of God we must be right in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our conscience must be pure, good, and without offense.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If, for example, I habitually lie, there will be an offense, a certain accusation, in my conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With such an offense, can I be in the presence of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No, I have to pass through the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The conscience has to approve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I tell you again, the conscience is the bridge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must pass the bridge to reach the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's salvation is to bring us back from human government to the conscience and then through the conscience into His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why the apostle Paul told us that we must have a good conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we lose a good conscience, we lose the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is through the conscience that we are brought back into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE FUNCTION OF THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The function of the conscience is threefold: to know what is right and wrong, to justify or to accuse, and to govern for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as the police govern people for society, the conscience within us constantly governs us for God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the fall, God governs us through the conscience that man may know what is right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man has such an organ to justify him or to accuse and condemn him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE FEELING OF THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The conscience has a consciousness, a feeling, or a sense.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The function of the conscience depends on this consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ephesians 4:19 says, "Who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Darby's New Translation, this verse says, "Having cast off all feeling."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The unbelieving sinners cast off their feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Feeling here mostly refers to the feeling of the conscience.</S>
