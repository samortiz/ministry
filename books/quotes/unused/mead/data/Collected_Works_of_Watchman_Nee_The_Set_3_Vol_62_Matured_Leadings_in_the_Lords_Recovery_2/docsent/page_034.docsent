   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEMAND OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST WITHIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Witness Lee: Ephesians 4:11-16 is on the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 12 says that all the gifts should be unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 16 follows by saying that all the members, joined and knit together through every joint of the rich supply, cause the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, the building is carried out by the gifts given by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the building is carried out by the members functioning together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A Christian is a person with Christ in him, living in him and abiding in him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since Christ is in us, He has demands.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He has demands because He is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many people say that the church is the totality of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is much better than those who say that the church is a building with towers and crosses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>More accurately, the church is the Christ living within me plus the Christ living within you, plus the Christ living within all the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An individual Christian is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since God became flesh, we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This Christ entered into many people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we add up the Christ within you, me, and many others, we have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not saying that the sum total of these people is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are saying that the Christ within these people added together is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An individual Christ is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let me ask another question: What is the service of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Taipei a brother who has been fellowshipping with me for many years told me once that he was very unhappy about the fact that we are so opposed to the denominations in their election of elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to realize that such a denominational system is absolutely different from our kind of arrangement and coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our coordination spontaneously issues from the functioning of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is produced by the demand of Christ who lives within all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ in the church is its service.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every saved believer can serve according to the life he has received from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we give more ground to Him, we are delivered from many sinful and worldly things on the one hand, and we participate in more service on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The life which we have received is the life of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In my body the blood in any member is as good as the blood in the whole body, because all the members have inherited the same life of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same way, the life within us is the life of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From 1934, we began to see clearly that Christ is our life; that is, He is our life in service.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a young sister loves her dresses more than the Lord, her desire for serving the Lord will spontaneously be reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No Christian can say that he is free from the love of the world, sin, and the flesh, and yet have no burden for man's soul; he is only waiting to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once a man drops the world, surely he will serve.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more the life of Christ functions within us, the more we will serve.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ within us is life, and Christ within the church is service.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For the past few days I have been quite pressed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Hong Kong there are about two hundred brothers and sisters who have received our fellowship and who have handed themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I felt pressed because I asked myself why these ones were not serving yet.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have been listening to messages for over ten days, and we still want to go on listening.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But those who have handed themselves over always have an urgent need in life to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This feeling is right and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the reason we have elders and deacons to make arrangements in the services.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These ones, however, are not produced through election.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The urge within everyone for service creates these needs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>An elder does not take it upon himself to be an elder; he is appointed by the Holy Spirit Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As the book of Hebrews says, the high priest in the Old Testament did not take the honor upon himself to be the high priest; he was called by God 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The source, basis, and nature of our arrangements are different from the way of organization in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are not a human organization; we are members in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everyone coordinates together by spontaneous arrangement, not by human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I will summarize the above words in this way: The Christ within us is not just our life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This life has its demands.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once we answer the demand of this Christ within us, we will be led to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Moreover, we will not serve Him individually, but in coordination in the church as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must pay attention to more than just answering the demand of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must see that this demand leads the whole Body to serve in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more we answer Christ's demand within us and coordinate with the brothers and sisters, the more comfortable we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If a Christian forsakes his money, career, and future but does not serve in coordination in the church, he will not have peace and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we pay attention to Christ's demand within us, we will realize that this Christ is leading us to the service of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a man is not saved, he does not have the life of Christ within him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, an unsaved person does not have a heart to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But a Christian who has Christ's life within him always has a heart to serve God, even if he has fallen miserably into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The responsible brothers in the church must treasure this desire for service within the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church must discover and stir up this desire.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a church cannot help its brothers and sisters to rise up to serve, it is a sick church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church is the aggregate of the life of Christ within the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The life of Christ within everyone spontaneously demands that we serve.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If a church does not take the lead and render the help to the brothers and sisters to serve the Lord, it is a sick church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is like the life in a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Under normal circumstances, it has to work and exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Other than when it lays down to rest, the body has many activities.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If a church does not work or serve, it is sick.</S>
