   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHRIST IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When did Peter begin to know Christ in such a clear way?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not during the three years that he followed the Lord back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The One he knew then was only the Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only after resurrection and in the Spirit did he begin to know Christ in the way that we know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unless Christ is in the Holy Spirit and unless He comes into us, we can never know Him in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A few years ago I passed through the country of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There were a number of missionaries in our group who tried to persuade me to take a tour to Palestine and stay there for two months.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They said, "Go and visit Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and the Mount of Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>See all the places where Jesus trod His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It will strengthen your faith."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At that time I had both the time and the money to travel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But I told them, "I have no desire to go there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It will not strengthen my faith, nor will it help me to know Christ more.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Christ in whom I believe will never be affected by Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if Jerusalem, Galilee, and Nazareth all vanish away, my knowledge of Him will still remain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am one with Him, and my experience of Him can never be affected by any outward factors.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have absolutely no interest in the so-called manger, wood and nails of the cross, and other relics.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These things can at most help me to know the Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What I treasure more is the Christ in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is more real and my knowledge of Him is more solid than the physical presence of you and me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CHRIST WHO IS LIVING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A passage we read earlier says that we no longer know Christ according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If what we believe in is merely an outward religion, then we will need a holy land, a mecca, or a Rome to be a center for us to go for worship and service.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But what we believe in is a Christ inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know that He is both the God in heaven as well as the Lord in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only is He the very Creator, but He was also the Christ that put on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And now He is in us as the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Christ in the flesh is over!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Christ in the Spirit lives forever in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>IN THE FLESH OR IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Dear friends, let me ask you a question.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Christ that you know, is He in the flesh or is He in the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Putting it another way, is your Christ the One in the Gospels or the One in the Epistles?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am not saying that you should not believe in the Christ of the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is right to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, that is only the first half.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The second half is to know and experience the Christ in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have seen three aspects of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, He is the God in the heavens; second, He is the God who came to earth to become a man; and third, He is the God in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These three aspects constitute the three steps of our experience of God.</S>
