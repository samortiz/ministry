O. Box 84, Hankow, June 1938)</h2><h2 class="head1">BROTHER LIN KWANG-TSAO SEEKS NEWS</h2><p>To the co-workers in Chekiang:</p><p>Reading The Open Door has reminded me of your work in the Lord. May the Lord Himself lead you. What is the situation in my home county of Ching-Shih County, Tsen Hai? Is there an assembly there? Are there co-workers and brothers there? I hope I can receive your news. May the Lord be with you. Amen.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Lin Kwang-tsao<br />May 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Witness Lee,<br />Chefoo, Shantung Province</h2><p>At the end of last month, more than ten brothers and sisters were baptized here. There has been a Bible study every morning except on the Lord's Day since the fourth of the month. We are studying the important points of the gospel. It is for the young people. We have had more than ten meetings. We probably need to continue. Brother Lee Bih passed through Chefoo on his way back to Tientsin on the tenth of the month. I met with him. At that time I told him that, if the Lord allowed, I would go to Tientsin at the beginning of May. I do not know how the Lord will arrange the environment. Please pray for me! I received a letter at the beginning of the month from the Baptist Church in Huang County asking me to hold a conference there. I was not able to go because I had already scheduled the Bible study meetings.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Witness<br />April 21<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Travels of Brother Chang Tze-jieh, Tsingtao, Shantung Province</h2><p>I have been out working for more than a month. I have been in five places and have stayed for at least four days in each place. Thank the Lord! There was no frustration in all the places we went. The messages which I preached were mostly about knowing God's truth. People have been edified indirectly through the tense environment. The brothers and sisters in Gao-Mi, Ching-Jou, Lin-Ti, Guang-Rao, and Tsinan are all safe. They have not backslidden. On the contrary, they are working more zealously and looking for the Lord to come quickly. Of the brothers in Tsingtao, only Brother Hsu Xiao-feng has gone to Shanghai, and Brother Wang Hung-kai has gone to Wen-Deng. The number in the meetings has not decreased. There are also a few newly saved ones. One is very stable. Perhaps God will want him to bear responsibility in the future. I might go to Chefoo. I hope to receive some help there. God has revealed Christ on the cross to me twice, so I wept twice. If the Lord wants me to go to Sikang, I can only submit to Him. According to the flesh, I hate to leave Shantung, especially Tsingtao. May the Lord give me the grace to completely obey and walk in His will.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Tze-jieh<br />May 5<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_137.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_139.html">Next</a> </body></html>
