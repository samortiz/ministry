If a believer desires to run a straight course in his spiritual pursuit, he must learn the meaning of God's governmental forgiveness
We will first distinguish the differences between these kinds of forgiveness, and then we will speak about governmental forgiveness
John 20:22-23 says, 'And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit
After this He said, 'Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained'
They pray for forgiveness with weeping and tears of repentance, and they receive the Lord Jesus with a sincere heart
At such times, it is good for a representative of the church to stand up and say to them, 'God has forgiven you of your sins'!
Verse 23 continues, 'Whosever sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whosever sins you retain, they are retained'
Only when the church has received the Holy Spirit and is under the authority of the Holy Spirit can it act as an instrument to God
Only after the Lord has made a man an instrument can he proclaim to a sinner, 'You are forgiven of your sins'!
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
After we believe in the Lord, confess our Christian faith, and receive eternal forgiveness, we may still sin at times
All biologists know that life has two basic characteristics: First, it strives to live, to preserve itself, to continue its existence
After we have believed in the Lord and are saved, our fellowship with God and with other children of God can be interrupted if we offend Him
She may close the door of the kitchen properly, clean her face, and wipe the table, but a transgression has been committed!
We call it forgiveness in fellow ship because only when one turns back to God and confesses his sins can his fellowship with God be restored
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
We can understand this kind of forgiveness from the following verses: Matthew 6:14-15; 9:2, 5-6; 18:21-35; James 5:15
On that particular day, when she comes back to the house, she may discover that her daughter has stolen food from the cabinets
The father forgives them and lets them out again the next day, but they get into a fight with other children again
He may say, 'Starting from tomorrow, you will stay at home and not go out because you have been fighting outside'
God will remove His governmental hand only when He has full assurance that His children are doing the right things
When the father sees his children continuing to make trouble, he will tell them to stay at home and withhold their freedom
If the children do not engage in a fight, the father may allow them to go out again for half an hour the next day
Governmental forgiveness is absolutely different from eternal forgiveness, instrumental forgiveness, and forgiveness in fellowship
If we do not understand governmental forgiveness, it will be hard to understand what the Lord Jesus was saying
In order for the paralytic to be healed and to rise again, he first needed to receive governmental forgiveness
When others carried the paralytic to the Lord Jesus, His forgiveness clearly related to the sickness of paralysis
Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord
The prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him'
The elders of the church were invited to anoint him with oil and pray for him, and the prayer of faith would cause the sick to rise up
The sin here is not forgiven through the confession of the sick one; it is forgiven through the prayer of the elders of the church
Although he has confessed his sins and has been forgiven and restored to fellowship, God's disciplining hand has not been lifted
He has to wait for the elders of the church to come to him and make petition on his behalf, saying, 'The brothers have forgiven his sins
When God removes His governmental hand, we have the fulfillment of the word, 'If he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him'
To understand the significance of governmental forgiveness, we must consider the example of David in the Old Testament
No portion of the Bible speaks of God's governmental forgiveness as clearly as the story of David with Uriah's wife
God had already put away David's sins, but He would cause the son born to Uriah's wife to die and the sword not to depart from his house
As soon as He stretches forth His governmental hand, you can do nothing except humble yourself under His mighty hand
The more we humble ourselves under His mighty hand and give up all resistance, the easier it is for God to lift His governmental hand
Suppose a brother loved sugar too much as a youth, and his teeth have decayed from the overconsumption of sweets
If you confess your weakness, the fellowship will be restored, but it does not mean that good teeth will grow back after your confession
God wanted him to command water to flow out from the rock, but he smote the rock with his rod and lost his composure
When they saw that it would take two people to carry a cluster of grapes, they realized that the land was a land flowing with milk and honey
They became afraid and refused to enter into that land, because they saw that the people who dwelt in that land were of great stature
He wanted to be a good Christian, but he did not want to set aside his career or spend his life for the gospel
Please bear in mind that our greatest fear is God's disciplining hand; we do not know when His hand will come upon us!
The fact that a person can call God Father proves that the matter of eternal forgiveness with him has long been settled
When the slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, he seized him and took him by the throat
We should not only be generous in forgiving others but also avoid criticizing or speaking about others in a light way
Please bear in mind that our criticism and careless comments about others often becomes a judgment upon ourselves
Sometimes a person may make a remark about someone's troublesome children, saying, 'See how God's hand is always on this person'
We must not say that since God has ordained that they go through persecution and suffering, we will do our part by adding suffering to them
We cannot say that we will add more sufferings to them because God has ordained their persecution and affliction
There are many brothers who have fallen miserably today for one reason only they have criticized others too severely in the past
We must always ask God for mercy in dealing with our foolishness and weakness, both in our walk and in everything we do
Should we fall into God's governmental hand, for any reason great or small, the last thing we should do is rebel
There is only one principle we can act upon when we fall into God's hand; that is, to humble ourselves under God's mighty hand
