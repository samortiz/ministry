   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TEACHING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO SING THE HYMNS AND SONGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also should learn to teach people to sing a hymn or a song.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some would say that they are not good singers, but not many people are.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have published five hymnals, but I am not an accomplished singer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Good singing may only provide amusement for people s ears.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may sing poorly, but if you sing in life, you will stir up people s interest to consider the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Simply go to the home meetings to teach people to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You should not sing a long hymn, mostly just one or two stanzas with a chorus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most children and young people like to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, you must learn to use some hymns and songs and how to sing with people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To learn the Bible, to learn the truths in our publications, and to learn the hymns all need time and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TEACHING PEOPLE TO PRAY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Presenting people written pages and teaching them to sing will lead them to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You must learn to never let a person go without prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You yourself must be a very prayerful person, a praying person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You must learn to pray all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then you will lead people to the point of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The most effective way to close the deal in your speaking with people is prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is by prayer and through prayer that people spontaneously exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In their spirit they will meet the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That means they will touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When they touch the Lord, they will be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The worst thing that could happen is that in your visit you would have too much talk without the spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must lead people into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Often many persons will say that they do not know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then you must pray, and tell them to follow you in the way you are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must open and begin the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then you may say, Will you please follow me?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What I say, you say.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To bring people into the spirit of prayer always requires much practice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you would give me a hammer, I may use it in a wrong way because I have not practiced using it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You have to practice using all the points I am giving to you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I believe that many doors will open to you, and you will have good opportunities to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>STIRRING UP THE INTEREST</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>OF ALL THE MEMBERS IN THE HOME</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>TO SHARE IN THE ACTIVITIES IN THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You must also learn how to stir up people s interest in sharing, in participating, in the meeting activities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the past we always had meetings in the way of some gifted ones doing everything in them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They prayed, sang, read the Bible, and did mostly everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That was absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, you can stir up the members of the home to be very much interested in singing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let them sing spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not make a schedule for the home meeting when to sing a hymn, when to pray, when to talk, and when to read the books.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That is too dead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If in a home a young girl or boy would sing what they heard you sing, take the opportunity to follow their lead.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then the meeting will begin, and the child will be stirred up with an interest to participate in the activities of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sometimes you may even ask a little boy to read a paragraph.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You may ask the wife to read a note.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not do everything by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Always try your best to bring people into the activities.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After three or four weeks all of them will be knowledgeable about the activities in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not explain to them beforehand how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When they do something, confirm that it is right and tell them that all the meetings will be their responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This will be a very good training to them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They will learn how to carry on a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Maybe after two months, some of them will go to their relatives to set up meetings in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What you do will be very productive.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Learn to use the written word, learn to use singing, and learn to stir up people s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>THE WORD, THE SPIRIT, SINGING, AND PRAYING</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For going into the homes of the new contacts to set up meetings, you need four items: the Word, the Spirit, singing, and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A meeting could always be stirred up or carried on by the Word of God, by the Spirit, by your singing, and also by your praying.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Ephesians 5:18-19 and Colossians 3:16 show us that to have a Christian meeting, we need these four elements.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For this reason you must become familiar with the Recovery Version and with the booklets.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You must also be persons daily filled inwardly with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You must have these four elements the Word, the Spirit, singing, and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then you can stir up a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Without these four elements, what could you do?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You must give others the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When you give them the Word, the Spirit is working.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Likewise, you must exercise in singing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You should sing spontaneously, call on the Lord, and pray in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Such a meeting will be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As long as you are there, everything should be stirred up with these four elements.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Have a meeting of about thirty to forty minutes, and go back the next week to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You will see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We all have to treasure the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Regardless of how they respond, do not give them up.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Pray for them, nourish them, and care for them so that they always keep their home open to you.</S>
