For you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inwardly they are full of extortion and self-indulgence." The above passage speaks of the Pharisees' avoiding the important issues and dwelling on the unimportant ones. They seek only after the outward appearance. "Extortion" indicates utilizing one's own lustful desire to repress and control others. "Self-indulgence" refers to indulging in lustful desire with one's own body.</P><P>Verses 26-28:"Blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and the dish so that their outside also may become clean. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you resemble white-washed graves, which outwardly appear beautiful but inwardly are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. So you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness." "Graves" refers to the dwelling places of the dead. White-washing means to beautify. To whiten the outward appearance when the flesh is dead is to cover up its death.</P><P>Verses 29-30:"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build up the graves of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the righteous, and say, If we had been there in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets." They were very fond of building monuments for people, thinking that their forefathers were most wicked because they killed the prophets. It is the same with the Jews today. They think that if Christ had been born in this age, they would not have crucified Him.</P><P>Verses 31-32:"So then you testify against yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets. And you, fill up the measure of your fathers!" Their boasting only proved that they were the generation of vipers. "Fill up" refers to killing the Lord and His disciples.</P><P>Verse 33:"Serpents! Brood of vipers! How shall you escape the judgment of Gehenna?" The Lord here indeed did not "regard the person of men"; He rebuked them as serpents and as the brood of vipers (serpents refer to Satan). They called God their Father and they called themselves the descendants of Abraham (John 8:39, 41), and yet they were really "the children of the devil" (1 John 3:10; John 8:44). Here the Lord mentions more concerning hell. Preachers should mention hell because God is not "good" in an irresponsible way. But the heretical preachers would not teach this.</P><P>Verse 34:"Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city." In this verse the Lord prophesied how the saints would suffer persecution and martyrdom later on. The Lord said that the scribes and Pharisees not only white-washed the graves and adorned the tombs, but were setting traps.</P><P>Verses 35-36:"So that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. Truly I say to you, All these things shall come upon this generation." Abel was the first person who was killed. The Zachariah here is not the Zechariah in 2 Chronicles 24:20-21. That Zechariah was too early, and he was also the son of Jehoiada. This is Zechariah the prophet, because he was the son of Berechiah (Zech. 1:1). Berechiah and Barachiah have a similar pronunciation, the only difference being that one name is Hebrew and the other is Greek. This is similar to Messiah and Messias, and Elijah and Elias, being the same person. The prophet Zechariah certainly was the last prophet, the prophet after the captivity. He was killed in the temple. After the destruction of the nation, he was one who suffered public persecution and was unfortunately killed. "This generation" extends from that day until now. Its scope is very broad and includes not only the Jews.</P><P>Verse 38:"Behold, your house is left to you desolate." "Your house" means the temple. The Lord did not say "the Father's house" or "My house," because the Jews were already rejected. (See the following passage in 24:1, where it says that Jesus left the temple.) After this the Lord said, "You shall by no means see Me from now on until you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord" (v. 39). After the great tribulation and during the millennium, the Israelites will bless the Lord. But at the present time the wild olive tree of the Gentiles is being grafted in (Rom. 11:24).</P><P>The great tribulation means the end of the dispensation of grace. All the dispensations have similar endings. At the end of the dispensation of innocence there was the exile from Eden. At the end of the dispensation of the conscience there was the flood. At the end of the dispensation of human government there was the confounding of the languages. At the end of the dispensation of the promises there was the sojourning in Egypt. At the end of the dispensation of the law there was the captivity. At the end of the dispensation of grace there will be the great tribulation, and at the end of the dispensation of the kingdom there will be the destruction by heavenly fire.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_082.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_084.html">Next</a> </body></html>
