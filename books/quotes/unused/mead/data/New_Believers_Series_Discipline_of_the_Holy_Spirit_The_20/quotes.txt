[1]  THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:28; Matt 10:29-31; Jer 48:11; Gen 47:7-10
[2]  We have believed in the Lord and have received a new life.
[3]  God arranges the necessary environment for us, and unconsciously, we are broken and the Holy Spirit is constituted into us so that we acquire a character and disposition that resembles God.
[4]  Romans 8:28 says, "All things work together for good to those who love God."
[5]  In other words, when God works, it is possible for us to receive the good, and it is also possible for us not to receive the good.
[6]  If a man claims that he has no choice of his own, that he asks nothing for himself, and that he only wants everything that God gives to him, he should have only one desire in his heart to love God.
[7]  When something happens to us and we do not have the love of God within us, when we crave and seek things for ourselves, or when we pursue private interests apart from God, the good that God has reserved for us will not come.
[8]  Brothers and sisters, please bear in mind that although all things do work together for good, we will not receive the good immediately if our hearts do not love God.
[9]  The Lord causes many things to come our way, few of which are according to our preference.
[10]  God is not only breaking us on the negative side but also constituting us on the positive side.
[11]  From the life of Jacob in Genesis, we can see the meaning of constitution.
