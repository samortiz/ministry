   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE DIFFERENTIATING THE SPIRIT FROM THE SOUL Scripture Reading: Heb 4:12; 1 Thes 5:23; Matt 16:24-26; Luke 9:23-25; Rom 8:6; 2 Cor 3:17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen clearly what the condition and the function of the spirit are.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we must learn how to differentiate the spirit from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Joints are the bones, and marrow is within the bone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Just as we differentiate these two things, we have to differentiate the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is difficult to differentiate the spirit from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is because we are fallen people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we have seen, the spirit of fallen man was deadened, and it lost its function.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that the human spirit within fallen man did not function.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From our youth, even from the day of our birth, we did not exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not exercise any organ of our being for a certain time, it becomes useless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>An expert once told me that if we do not use our eyes for three months, they will lose the function of sight, and it will take a long time to recover our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As fallen people, our spirit was deadened, and for a long time we did not use it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we were very accustomed to using our body and our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, after the fall of man, the human mind became overdeveloped.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now the mind is always too active.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even after we are saved and our spirit is made alive and renewed, we still are not used to exercising the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today's psychology does not even recognize that there is a spirit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The science of psychology only recognizes the body and the psyche, that is, the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible, however, reveals to us that we have a third part, not only a body and a soul but also a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Thessalonians 5:23 says, "And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our soul comprises the mind as the leading part and the emotion and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our spirit, which was deadened, is made alive, regenerated, and renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we are still not used to the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>More than twenty years ago we lived in a small town in northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Like other homes in that town, ours had no electricity, so we used an oil lamp for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day electricity was installed in our home.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time I visited people almost every day beginning early in the morning, and I came back in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever I came back home, the first thing I did was to put away my bicycle and pick up a match to light the lamp, even after electric lights had been installed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I did this, our children would laugh at me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I saw them laughing, I said to myself, "Foolish man, throw the match away."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then I went to the switch to turn on the lights.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For many years I was used to picking up a match to light the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now electricity had been installed, but I was not used to it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today the heavenly "electricity" has been installed in our spirit, but we are not used to exercising this part.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are still used to "picking up the match" in our soul.</S>
