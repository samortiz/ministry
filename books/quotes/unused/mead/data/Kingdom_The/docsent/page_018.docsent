   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINGLING OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus was not born in such a simple way, but in a very meaningful way as the issue of all kinds of human generations, from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, through the kings, and then through the captured and returned ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, this is only one aspect of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Another aspect is the mingling with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was not only the issue of many generations of the human race, but He was also mingled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was the issue of forty-one generations of humanity mingled with the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the revelation of the Bible, the Father is in the Son John 14:11 , the Son is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 , and the Spirit is the application of the Triune God to the mingled humanity 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we have the Lord Jesus, we have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this One we have Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, David, Solomon, and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also have the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was the issue of forty-one human generations mingled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It will take eternity for us to fully apprehend this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only in eternity will we fully understand what the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus is not so low and so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is much more than a Savior who had pity on poor sinners and saved them from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to pray over chapter one of Matthew again in the light of all the history of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we will see what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>JESUS AND EMMANUEL</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jesus means "Jehovah-plus."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jesus is not only Jehovah; He is Jehovah-plus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Hebrew, the name of Jehovah is included in the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Jesus means Jehovah plus "the Savior," or plus "the salvation, the deliverance."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jesus is Jehovah plus the all-inclusive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Emmanuel means God "with us," another plus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus is not only God; He is God "with us."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We would tell our Jewish friends that we are richer than they.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have what they have, but they do not have what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They have Jehovah, and they have God; but we have Jehovah plus "salvation" and God plus "with us."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We would invite them to come and join us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They would have everything to gain and nothing to lose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We would never join them, because we have something richer, higher, better, and greater; this is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He, as the issue of all the human generations mingled with the Triune God, is Jehovah-plus and God-plus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From now on, surely you will have another taste when you call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His name is so rich, so sweet, and He is rich to all who call upon His name Rom 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hallelujah for Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hallelujah for Jehovah-plus!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah for Emmanuel!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hallelujah for God-plus!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jehovah-plus and God-plus is the seed which has been sown into us.</S>
