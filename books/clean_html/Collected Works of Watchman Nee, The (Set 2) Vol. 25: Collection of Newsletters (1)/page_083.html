<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Letter from Brother Yuan Chin Chou</H2><P>Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</P><P>We praise and thank the Lord because He has called some to meet in His name in Hsi Mao Wang Chuang which is to the northeast (ten miles) of the Kuang Jau county seat. They meet as obedient children and have become holy. God has truly manifested His own works of power. When a sinner repents, the angels in heaven rejoice. How much more should we rejoice when some believers repent and become obedient children!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Beginning of their Table Meeting<br>in the Lord's Name</H2><P>The table meeting in Hsi Mao Wang Chuang of Kuang Jau began on May 28, 1934 (the Lord's Day). A few days before that Lord's Day, a Mr. Nieh Jen Yi heard the word of the truth, the gospel of salvation, and believed that Jesus was the Son of God and the unique Savior. He also heard about baptism and obeyed the commandment of the Lord. On that Lord's Day, he was baptized in the Tzu River (seven miles from here) at 10:00 in the morning. In the evening we had a Lord's table meeting. There were two brothers, Nieh Tao Hung and Nieh Jen Yi, and four sisters and myself in attendance. Altogether there were seven people meeting together in harmony. We happily met, fellowshipped with each other, broke the bread, and prayed to remember the Lord and to praise God's greatness!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Origin of their Meeting<br>and Present Condition</H2><P>This area has been under the Presbyterian denomination for many years. The brothers and sisters usually meet in Brother Nieh Tao Hung's house. On the Lord's Day there are sometimes people from other villages in the meetings. There are usually about twenty people with more women than men. They have now rented two simple buildings specifically for meetings in the Lord's name. The chairs, tables, and other furnishings have all been borrowed (from the believers' homes). All the expenses come out of the newly established offering box. The two responsible brothers are the two Niehs.</P><P>More than half of them cannot read, so they have a problem reading the Bible. Now they hope and ask the Lord to enable them to read the thousand-character gospel lessons and Bible Studies for Beginners. But there is no one to take the responsibility. Please pray for them concerning this matter.</P><P>There is another matter that has come up recently. There are four people who have life and are willing to obey the Lord and be baptized, but their father will not allow it. He has hindered them by saying, "It is all right if you get baptized at home by sprinkling, but you cannot get baptized by immersion outside the home. The river is too far, and there are too many people watching. Even if you are not ashamed, I am ashamed for you! What is more, in this area no one has seen anyone go into the water like this. I am afraid you will be in danger of swallowing too much water!" Please give them some advice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Recent Opposition from Outsiders</H2><P>Their actions have attracted the attention and opposition of many people in the denominations! They look on them as ones who create confusion and who have been carried off by the winds of heresy and the deceptions of Satan. Therefore, they reject them. Even though they are meeting with this kind of opposition, the brothers and sisters are able to stand firm by the overcoming Lord. May the brothers and sisters who faithfully love the Lord pray before the Lord for the meeting in Kuang Jau's Hsi Mao Wang Chuang and ask the Lord to keep them until He comes. Amen. Peace to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord!</P><P>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br>Yuan Chin Chou<br>Mailing Address: 30 Nan Kuan, Ling Tzu, Shantung</P>
