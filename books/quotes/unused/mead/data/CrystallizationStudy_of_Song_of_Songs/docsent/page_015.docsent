   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF SONG OF SONGS MESSAGE FIVE DELIVERED FROM THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY THE CROSS OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: S.S. 2:14-15</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As an opening word to this message, I would like to share something concerning the way that we study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We study the Word of life by the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why we have called our Bible study a life-study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our life-study is different from Christianity theology.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Christianity there are many kinds of theology.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these kinds of theology in a certain sense help people, but in a greater sense retain them in that theology.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, reformed theology in a sense helps people, but in a stronger sense it holds people back and keeps them far away from the divine revelation that is unveiled in God s holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more we compare traditional theology with the teaching of the Bible, the more discrepancies we find.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to traditional theology, the Son of God was born to be a man, but the Bible in 1 Timothy 3:16 says that God was manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here is a discrepancy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Was the incarnation the incarnation of the Son only or of the entire God, the complete God?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Certainly it was the Son s incarnation, but we should never forget that the Son is a part of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Colossians 2:9 tells us that Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Son s incarnation was the incarnation of the Divine Trinity, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we have gone higher from the life-study of the Bible to what we call the crystallization-study.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The life-study is on the first level.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The crystallization-study is on the second level.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Crystallization in our usage is based upon the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We want to see the organic crystals in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us consider one of these crystals in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans comprises two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first is judicial.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 1:17 says, The righteous shall have life and live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The righteous shall have is judicial, unveiling the legal procedure of God s salvation in saving sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Shall have life and live by faith is organic, unveiling the purpose of God s salvation in carrying out God s economy according to His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ s redemption by His blood is the first part of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is judicial to fulfill the righteous requirements according to God s righteous law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But this is just the procedure not the purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The purpose is for man to have life and to live life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church as the Body of Christ cannot be seen in the judicial part of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Body of Christ is in the organic aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The judicial process and the organic purpose of God s salvation are a big crystal in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to be convinced that the genuine, pure revelation according to the holy Scripture is critically different from today s Christianity theology.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today s Christianity is deformed and degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am burdened to share this because by listening to our prayers, I can sense the oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our prayers have been formed, regulated, and kept mostly according to the old theology.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not pray according to the old theology.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, we should pray according to what we have seen recently.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>DELIVERED FROM THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Song of Songs 2:14-15 portrays the lover s deliverance from the self by the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Overcaring for Her Spiritual Condition</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The attainment of the lover of Christ in her pursuing after Christ for satisfaction and rest results in a condition in which she overcares for her spiritual condition before Christ concerning whether or not she remains in the perfection she has attained.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I was young, after giving a good message, I could not forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I would remain in it to enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, I would make it the standard for my upcoming messages.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the messages had to be as good as that one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This meant that I had attained to a certain condition and that I wanted to remain in it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When some of the sisters give a testimony in the meetings, they are looking for strong amens from the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One day a sister may give a wonderful word, and the saints may respond with strong amens and hallelujahs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That makes the sister feel that she has been exalted to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She would never forget this experience and would make it her standard because that became a condition to which she had attained.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This boasting produces the self.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The self is produced by self-boasting, self-exaltation, and self-glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more we boast of ourselves, the stronger our self becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Based upon our boasting, we exalt ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then we glorify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may not admit this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead we may say, I gave all the glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But still we received the exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Exaltation means glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To exalt God is to glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This shows that pride is the source of self.</S>
