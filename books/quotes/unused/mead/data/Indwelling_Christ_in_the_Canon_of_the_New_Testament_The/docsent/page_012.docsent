   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPECIAL SPIRIT IN JOHN SEVEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 7:37-39, the Lord speaks about drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Spirit was not yet; because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit in John seven is special, because it says that the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The King James Version inserts the word given, but it is not in the original.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The original says that at that time the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that before Jesus was resurrected, there was not such a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The life-giving Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not resurrected yet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is the same with a little seed when it is sown into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When it is grown up and blossoms, it is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When it is glorified, it becomes something else.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is no more a seed, but a flower.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Jesus was in John seven, He was still a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He had not yet become the life-giving Spirit for us to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all know that when Jesus was speaking in John seven, the Spirit of God was here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We could not say that the Spirit of God was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There was the Spirit of God, but the life-giving Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is because Jesus had not gone through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He was resurrected, He was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then He became the life-giving Spirit, so available for us to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BAPTISM AND DRINKING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The baptism is in Matthew, and the drinking is in John.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason 1 Corinthians 12:13 tells us that we have all been baptized in one Spirit, and we have been made to drink of one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then, following chapter twelve, 1 Corinthians 15:45 says, The last Adam was made the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So in 1 Corinthians we have these two verses telling us of two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Chapter twelve tells us to drink of one Spirit, and chapter fifteen tells us that the Lord became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These two spirits are certainly one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The life-giving Spirit in chapter fifteen is the one Spirit in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So to drink of one Spirit is to drink of Jesus as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is so important that we see these two aspects of baptism and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We start with baptism, and we continue with drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, baptism is once and for all, but drinking is continuous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should never stop drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By baptism we were put into Christ, and by drinking we get Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be put into Christ is once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But to get Christ into every part of our being takes a life time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is even a matter of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the New Jerusalem, we will still be drinking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we get into eternity, baptism will cease, but drinking will continue.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We will drink for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is so clear that the river of life in Revelation twenty-two is not for baptism, but for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come, and let him that heareth say, Come.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And let him that is athirst come.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE CONFUSION OF BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nothing in today s Christianity is so confusing as the matter of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are many who think that the baptism is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They want the baptism, but they don t want the drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They even speak about 1 Corinthians 12:13, but they never mention the last part of the verse concerning drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The real need is not the baptism, but the drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must realize that the baptism has been already accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even before we were born, we were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For in one Spirit were we all baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many times people have asked me, Have you been baptized in the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I tell them that I was baptized in the house of Cornelius before I was born.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all know that our sins were taken away on the cross before we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is the same with the baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is once and for all.</S>
