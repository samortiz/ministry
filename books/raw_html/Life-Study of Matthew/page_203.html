<h2 class="head2">B. To Inherit Eternal Life in the Coming Age</h2><p>In verse 29, the Lord also speaks of inheriting eternal life. To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded in the coming age (Luke 18:29-30) with the enjoyment of the divine life in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. In the manifestation of the kingdom, we shall participate in the enjoyment of eternal life in the millennial kingdom with the Lord Jesus. This will be greater than the first aspect of the kingdom reward, which we receive in this age.</p><h2 class="head2">C. In the Time of Restoration<br />to Be Co-kings with Christ</h2><p>In verse 28 the Lord said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&rdquo; The regeneration is the restoration of the coming kingdom age (Acts 3:21) after the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. In the coming kingdom, the overcomers will sit on thrones to reign over the earth (Rev. 20:4). The first twelve apostles, including Peter, will judge the twelve tribes of Israel, while the others will rule over the nations (Rev. 2:26).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Not Being a Legal Matter</h2><p>After hearing the Lord&rsquo;s answer, Peter had nothing more to say. His mouth was shut. But the Lord went on to say, &ldquo;But many that are first shall be last, and the last first&rdquo; (v. 30). Many Christians use this verse, but most use it incorrectly. I am concerned that many of us do not understand this verse properly. Some say that a person who has just been saved but who has considerable experience is an example of the last becoming first. This is a natural interpretation. Others say that the young ones, who are last, have become the first, and that we, the older ones, are out of date and have become the last. This also is a natural understanding. Knowing that we would take His word in a natural way, the Lord gave the parable in 20:1-16 to explain the meaning of this verse. The word &ldquo;For&rdquo; at the beginning of 20:1 indicates that this parable is an explanation of 19:30. Furthermore, in 20:16 the Lord again says that the last shall be first and the first last. This also proves that the parable is an interpretation of the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p><p>In order to understand 19:30 and the parable in 20:1-16, we need to see that Peter had a commercial mentality. His commercial mentality was exposed in 19:27, when he asked, &ldquo;What then is there for us?&rdquo; In other words, Peter was saying, &ldquo;Lord, we have paid the price. Now what will You give us?&rdquo; At the supermarket we pay a certain price and receive in exchange something with a certain value. We get what we pay for. This was Peter&rsquo;s concept. He said that they had left everything to follow the Lord, that is, they had paid the full price. Now he wanted to know what he would get in exchange for the price he had paid. The Lord Jesus was fair and answered Peter in a clear way in 19:28 and 29. The Lord seemed to say, &ldquo;When I sit on the throne of My glory, you will sit on twelve thrones. Peter, this is what you have paid the price for. Everyone who has left houses or relatives for My name&rsquo;s sake will receive a two-part reward, the first part in this age and the second part in the coming age. In this age you will receive a hundredfold to replace the material things you left. In the coming age you will have the full enjoyment of eternal life.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s answer was clear and fair, and I believe Peter was very satisfied with it.</p><p>The Lord, however, did not let Peter go, for he needed a further lesson. Therefore the Lord said that many (but not all) who are first shall be last, and the last first. This indicates that many, like Peter, who were the first would be the last to receive the reward. The Lord said this in order to revolutionize Peter&rsquo;s commercial mentality. The Lord seemed to be saying to Peter, &ldquo;Those who are the first will be last, and those who are the last will be first. I say this to show you that what I give you is not based upon your commercial sense. Although you must pay in order to receive the reward of the kingdom, receiving the reward is not a commercial matter. Actually, the price you have paid means nothing.&rdquo;</p> <p>The same, of course, is true of us today. What we have given up does not mean anything. Even if the President of the United States were to give up his presidency in order to have the kingdom reward, that would not mean anything. However, what the Lord gives means a great deal. If you pay a dollar for something at the department store, you receive something worth a dollar; and if you pay a hundred dollars, you receive something worth a hundred dollars. But, in the eyes of the Lord, the price we pay for the reward is just a few cents, but the reward He gives is worth millions. What could we pay to receive the full enjoyment of eternal life? The full enjoyment of eternal life in the manifestation of the kingdom is priceless. The price we pay cannot compare with the reward we shall receive. Receiving the reward is not a commercial transaction. It is not a matter of paying a certain amount and of receiving something equal to that in value.</p><p>Actually, what we pay is dung (Phil, 3:8). Everything apart from Christ is dung. The Lord seemed to be saying to Peter, &ldquo;Peter, in the kingdom you will be sitting on the throne ruling over the children of Israel. This is the kingship. Peter, all you have given up to obtain this is dung. Do you think you can buy the kingship with dung? If you attempt to pay Me with dung, I would not accept it. Rather, I would tell you to get rid of those things. Although the price you pay is dung, I shall reward you with the kingship.&rdquo; Peter, who had a commercial mentality, needed to be reeducated by the Lord Jesus. The Lord was wise and patient with him and gave a long parable to explain what He meant when He said that the first would be last and the last first.</p>
