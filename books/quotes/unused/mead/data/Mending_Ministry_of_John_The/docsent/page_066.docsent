   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Bride, the Wife of the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Strange as it may seem, this tabernacle is also called the bride, the wife of the Lamb Rev 21:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can the wife of the Lamb be also God's dwelling place?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is hard to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the Bible tells us that the New Jerusalem is, on the one hand, God's tabernacle and, on the other hand, Christ's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Father's home is the Son's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In eternity God the Father has a home, which is called the tabernacle, and God the Son has a wife, which is that very tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How can the theologians systematize this?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A City</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This tabernacle is also called the holy city 21:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A tabernacle is only a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How could a tent be a city?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Jerusalem is a city; the city is a tabernacle; and the tabernacle is a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is what the Bible tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I will leave the matter there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Temple</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At first the children of Israel had the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then they entered the good land, conquered the enemy, and secured the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Afterwards they built the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The tabernacle was then merged with the temple 1 Kings 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These two, the tabernacle and the temple, were God's greatest blessing to His people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is because both were God's home.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as they had the house of God, they could locate God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They could tell others where He was.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The tabernacle and the temple were the center and focus of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we come to the New Jerusalem, we are told that it is the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John must have been looking around for the temple, since he tells us, "And I saw no temple in it" Rev 21:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He then adds, "For its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These words are troublesome, but from carefully reading these last two chapters, we can see that the city is not only the tabernacle, but also the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the tabernacle, the city is the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the temple, the city is the enlargement of God Himself and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God Mingled with His Redeemed People</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we dig through all that is implied here, we must conclude that this city is the enlargement of God Himself, so it is the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The wife is God's redeemed, including us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The new city is the tabernacle, the wife, and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This city is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Theologians are left with no explanation for the strange city.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We say, however, that it is the mingling of the Triune God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>So far we have made reference to God the Father 21:22 and to Christ the Son, the Lamb v. 22 . Where can we find the Spirit mentioned? Revelation 22:17 tells us, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! Let him who hears also say, Come! Let him who is thirsty also come; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely." Thus in these two chapters we have the Triune God mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And there is also the tabernacle, the temple, the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 21:7 it says, "He who overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he shall be a son to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here is an indication that this city is composed of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the city is a wife, how could it be made up of sons?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is it male or female?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This bothers the human mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With our limited understanding, we can only say that the New Jerusalem is a composition of the Triune God and His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Old Testament presents first the tabernacle, then the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It also considers God's redeemed people as His wife Isa 54:5-6 and His redeemed and regenerated ones as His sons Exo 4:22; Isa 43:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this New Testament age we also have a double status.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are the sons of God, enjoying and inheriting all the Father's blessing Rom 8:14, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are also the wife of Christ, participating in His love Eph 5:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As sons, we enjoy the Father's life; as a wife, we enjoy the Son's love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The New Jerusalem, then, is composed of the Father's sons enjoying His life; it is also the wife of the Lamb, enjoying the Son's love.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Both life and love are here; one is for the sons, the other for the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This composition of the Triune God and His redeemed and regenerated people is a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This city, as the tabernacle and temple of God, is where He dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The New Testament tells us clearly that God does not dwell in a physical building Acts 17:24 , that we are the house of God 1 Tim 3:15 and God's temple 1 Cor 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The New Jerusalem, then, is the ultimate consummation of God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are that dwelling place; God is the Dweller.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Where do we dwell?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We dwell in God!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This fulfills what Moses said in Psalm 90:1: "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are God's dwelling place, and God becomes our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is also the concept in John 15:4: "Abide in Me and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We say this is the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some may say that God is too lofty to mingle with mean man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have been saved, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are human, but we are no longer mean.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are noble, even splendid.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our full splendor is yet to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When He comes, we shall be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then our splendor will appear in full.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are not only joined to the Lord; we have even been mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He dwells in us, and we dwell in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What a wonder this is!</S>
