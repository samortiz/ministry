   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE EIGHT ASPECTS OF THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS Scripture Reading: Rev 1:11-13, 20; 7:9-17; 12:1-2, 5-6, 9-11; 14:1-5, 14-16; 15:2-4; 19:7-10, 14-20; 17:14; 21:11, 18-19; 4:3a; 14:8; 17:1-5; 18:2a, 4; 19:1-6 THE SHINING GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Revelation reveals eight aspects of the church as the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first aspect, in chapters 1 through 3, is the seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The lampstands themselves have three main significances.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, the lampstands shine in the dark night.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, the lampstands are golden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In typology, gold signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything in the church as the testimony of Jesus must be in the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Third, the shining of the golden lampstands is so that people may see Christ as the Son of Man walking in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If anyone says, You talk so much about Jesus, but where is He?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>, we can boldly point them to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can answer, Come and see Jesus in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today Jesus is walking, acting, moving, living, working, and saving people in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The present age is the nighttime, and in every corner and avenue of human society there is nothing but darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, every local church is a shining lampstand, illuminating people that they may see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When people see Christ in the churches, they can realize that the churches are not low, mean, earthly, sinful, or mixed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, everything in them is golden and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the first aspect that Revelation reveals to us concerning the churches as the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the golden lampstands are identical to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians, having taken in a mistaken concept, desire to be different from other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I came to this country fourteen years ago, I met some dear Christians who were troubled because the local churches were all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They told me that they preferred to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may compare the identical nature of the lampstands to the similarities of our physical bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since everyone is created with the same organs, it would be foolish for anyone to say that he wants a different number of organs in order to not be the same as others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who claim that every local church should be unique base their concept upon the differences among the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I was young, I was influenced by this concept and I taught the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, one day the light dawned upon me, and I saw that all the differences in the local churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are negative, not positive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ephesus lost her first love 2:4 , Pergamos is worldly v. 13 , Thyatira is demonic vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>20, 24 , and Laodicea is lukewarm 3:15 ; all these are negative matters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the positive side, however, all the local churches are identical, because they all are golden.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we were to place the seven lampstands before us, we would not be able to tell them apart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the seven lampstands are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, some people in this country have boldly declared that they will never be like the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, many of these voices have now faded away, and the peculiar concepts they advocated have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not that we must all follow one certain church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, it is that we all must have the same number of organs, that is, the same nature and appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the positive side, all the local churches must be identical, but on the negative side, they are different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If one church begins to worship idols, we must refuse to follow that church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In matters such as this, we must be different.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, it is wrong to say that the local churches should not be the same in the positive matters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not try to make ourselves peculiar or different; this is to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The four sides of the New Jerusalem are all built with the same material jasper 21:12-14, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not that one side is built with jasper, and another side with a different material.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because we are all one church universally, the local churches throughout the earth should be identical, not in every practical matter but in nature and appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Locally, we are the churches; universally, we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A GREAT MULTITUDE OF THE REDEEMED SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 7:9-17 we see the testimony of Jesus as a great multitude, those who have been redeemed out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues throughout all the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 14 says, These are those who come out of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This refers to the tribulations, sufferings, persecutions, and afflictions experienced by God s redeemed people throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because the world always afflicts the church John 16:33 , wherever the church is, there will always be a certain amount of persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This great multitude has come out of tribulation in a victorious way, for they all hold palm branches, which signify their victory over tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Revelation 7:15 says, He who sits upon the throne will tabernacle over them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eventually, in eternity, God will overshadow them with Himself as their tabernacle 21:3; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the destiny of God s redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, the Lamb will also shepherd them and guide them to springs of waters of life for eternity Rev 7:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verses 9 through 17 do not portray any particular group of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, they present a general record of the whole of God s redeemed ones and their state in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In eternity, their state will be that of enjoying God s overshadowing and Christ s shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This portion of the Word reveals that while Christ is executing God s judgment upon mankind, He will take care of God s redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All God s redeemed ones eventually will be raptured to the throne of God and will stand there enjoying God s overshadowing and the Lamb s shepherding.</S>
