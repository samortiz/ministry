AND CONSIDERING<br />
WHO WE CAN PERFECT</h2>
<p>The co-workers must see that the age has turned. If we do not turn, we will have a fundamental problem. In our practice, however, we also need to consider how much we can perfect and whether those whom we are serving need our perfecting. We have entered into the age of perfecting. We can no longer do a replacing work; we must do a perfecting work. Our problem is that we do not know how to perfect others. It is not sufficient for a co-worker to be faithful in the Lord&rsquo;s work and diligent in his conduct. We do not know how to work if a saint can pass through our hand without being perfected. If we do not perfect others, our work will not be effective no matter how much time and effort we spend.</p>
<p>In this age those who can perfect others know how to work. Hence, our usefulness in a locality depends on whether those whom we are serving need our perfecting. If they do not need our perfecting, we should go somewhere else. If a brother can teach only junior high school and the local people are all in high school, there is no use for him to stay there. He should go somewhere else. If he is an expert in teaching junior-high students and he goes to a place where the children are all in elementary school, he will be successful. This example shows how to work. Suppose a brother does not know his ability or the level of the saints he is serving in a locality. Suppose he can teach only &ldquo;junior high school,&rdquo; but he is assigned to work with &ldquo;high-school students.&rdquo; He may spend much time serving, but he is wasting himself and delaying others. This shows that he does not know how to work. Knowing how to work involves knowing ourselves, knowing our circumstances, and recognizing the times. Hence, the co-workers must evaluate what they can do and consider the saints whom they can help. This is the way to perfect others.</p>
<p>The co-workers are still holding on to old things. We should overturn this situation so that we can perfect more saints. Perfecting the saints does not mean that we will no longer need to do anything. On the contrary, we should do more, and we can do more. We should distribute responsibilities to others and at the same time teach, perfect, and equip them. Consequently, the number of functioning saints will grow.</p>
<p>In the United States there is a pastor who is educated, eloquent, and capable. He has been taking the lead and overseeing a group for more than twenty years. Because the number of people in that group grew from forty to around four thousand, he is considered to be a successful pastor. However, the Lord is not leading us to take the way of attracting people by personal gifts but to take the way of perfecting the saints. The Lord led me to go to the United States more than ten years ago. More than thirty local churches have been raised up, and there are over six thousand saints. No matter how capable I am, I cannot take care of all the local churches by myself. Our way is to perfect many saints to function in each local church. The six thousand saints do not have the same function, because everyone has different natural abilities. When we perfect them, their function will be manifested. If we let a seed grow, its form will be manifested. When it grows, we will know whether it is a peach, a plum, or an almond tree.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO PERFECT OTHERS<br />
AND TO PROPAGATE</h2>
<p>As the co-workers are considering before the Lord how to go on in the future, they should evaluate their ability and consider the level of the saints whom they are serving. If no place needs us, we can open up virgin land. On the active side of the Lord&rsquo;s work, there is a need for propagation, but there is no need to &ldquo;put icing on a cake.&rdquo; We should not serve a dish of steamed fish after everyone at a feast has been satisfied. The steamed fish may be good, but it is unnecessary due to the timing. It would be better to take the &ldquo;fish&rdquo; to a place where it is needed. Likewise, if a local church does not have a need, it is unnecessary for a co-worker to stay there. He should go to a place that has a need. If no place has a need, then he should open up virgin land. There are still many places that are waiting to be opened up. All the co-workers should learn how to perfect and how to propagate. Appointing elders and perfecting them is for the Lord&rsquo;s propagation, because the younger saints will carry out the work when they rise up. Propagation comes out of perfecting.</p>
<p>The work of the co-workers should be based on the following points. First, we must see that the age of replacing is over. This is the age of perfecting. Second, we need to consider how many people we can perfect and whether the saints we are serving need our perfecting. If a place does not have a need, we should not stay there. We should go to a place that needs our perfecting. Third, the Lord&rsquo;s work and propagation are needed even if all the existing localities are blessed and not in need of our perfecting. There is still a need to open up virgin land. This is propagation. Therefore, the co-workers must bury the concept and practice of replacing others. This fundamental issue must be resolved so that we may consider how many people we can perfect and whether the saints we are serving need our perfecting. If we are unable to perfect others or the saints have advanced beyond our ability, we should go somewhere else. If no locality has a need, we should go to open up virgin land and start from scratch.</p>
<p>This is the age of the new man. We can no longer do a work that is limited to one place. Such a work no longer matches the age. Those in the Lord&rsquo;s work must produce a living impact that is not limited to a locality or a group of saints. Under God&rsquo;s sovereignty the emphasis in the world is on blending. Hence, we should not do an independent work. We are not working for ourselves but for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. May we all contribute to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The co-workers need to soberly consider these points before the Lord.</p>
<p>When the co-workers go to different places, we must pay attention to the new saints. Gradually, the saints will manifest their gift, and we should learn how to cultivate and perfect these saints. We should lead these ones and give them responsibilities according to the level of their growth in life. After working in such a way for a few years, these saints may rise up and do what we do. When they are all perfected, we can do other things. Otherwise, we will be doing the same thing for twenty years. Everything will still be under our control, and the saints will need to report everything to us. We should not be like that capable pastor in the United States, who worked for more than ten years only to establish one large, strong group. It would be better if those few thousand people could produce thirty or more local churches. Then everyone could function. The fundamental principle is that we must let the younger saints rise up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTION AND ANSWER</h2>
<p><em>Question: When this generation of co-workers was raised up, there were already forty local churches in Taiwan. These co-workers were cultivated in the churches or taught under the leading of the senior co-workers; hence, they do not have the experience of opening up virgin land. This is their aspiration, but they do not know how to open up virgin land.</em></p>
<p>Answer: We may not know how to do something, but we can learn while doing. We learn by doing. Riding a bicycle is an example. Even if we are not taught how to ride a bicycle, if we have a bicycle and ride it, we will know how to ride a bicycle after a few days. Of course, if no one teaches us, we will fall many times. Nevertheless, even if we fall, we will know how to ride a bicycle. There is no set way to open up virgin land. The way that I say to do it may work if I do it, but it might not work if you do it. Furthermore, when I do it, I may do something different because of the situation. The key is to receive a burden. If the localities do not need our perfecting, we need to be ambitious before the Lord to open up virgin land. We should be willing to spend a number of years to bring forth a few people.</p>
<p>Someone may go to a small locality with churches nearby. As long as he remains in fellowship, he will spontaneously receive a supply from the nearby churches. He will be connected to the nearby churches, and all the churches in Taiwan will pray for him and may even send a supply to his locality. He does not need to wait for the co-workers to hold a conference and assign someone to join him. Such a practice involves too much of the human will. The co-workers should live a life of prayer before the Lord to receive a burden from Him.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the co-workers should stop caring for the saints and venture out on their own. This is individualistic. When some co-workers open up virgin land, the nearby churches should immediately join in by praying for them and supplying them practically; this is a proper situation. The other co-workers in Taiwan should also join in by remembering them in prayer. It is not improper for the work to arrange things by determining who goes where and by requesting material offerings from the local churches for the work, but this is rigid and inorganic.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Age of the One New Man &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
