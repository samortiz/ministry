<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Full of Grace and Reality</H2><P>He was also full of grace (God gained by us) and reality (God realized by us). Christ Himself is the grace to be gained and enjoyed by us and the reality to be realized and experienced by us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Becoming the Last Adam</H2><P>As the Word who is God, Christ became the last Adam, the last man (1 Cor. 15:45).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Becoming the Seed of David</H2><P>In this flesh, Christ became the seed of David (Rom. 1:3; Matt. 1:1a), the seed of Abraham and the seed of woman (Matt. 1:1b; Gal. 4:4). The seed of David implies Christ's human nature. By incarnation, the first step of Christ's process, God was brought into humanity. In the Bible flesh is not a positive word. Nevertheless, the Bible declares that the Word became flesh. The gospel of God concerns God who became flesh; according to the flesh He became the seed of man. Galatians 4:4 says that Christ was born of a woman. The Son of God was born of the virgin Mary (Luke 1:27-35) to be the seed of woman, as promised in Genesis 3:15.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Suffering</H2><P>Christ became flesh to suffer, to be crucified (1 Pet. 4:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. In the Days of His Flesh<br>Christ Praying with Strong Crying and Tears</H2><P>In the days of His flesh in Gethsemane, Christ offered up both petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears to God to save (resurrect) Him out of death, and He was heard because of His piety (Heb. 5:7). God answered His prayer by raising Him from the dead.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. The Spirit of God Confessing<br>That Christ Came in the Flesh</H2><P>The Spirit of God confesses that Christ came in the flesh in the teaching of the apostles, but at the end of the first century, when the apostle John was still in his ministry, Docetism intermixed with Gnosticism denied that Christ came in the flesh (see 1 John 4:2-3 with note 1 of verse 3, and 2 John 7).</P>
