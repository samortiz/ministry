   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c Simeon Being Omitted in Moses' Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Simeon was omitted from Moses' blessing recorded in Deuteronomy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the righteous law of God, Simeon had no ground to be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not an insignificant matter to be omitted from the record of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Simeon was altogether too natural, never exercising any restriction over his natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe he was the one who initiated the plot to kill Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, when Joseph's brothers came down to Egypt the first time, Joseph arranged for Simeon to be kept in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While he was in prison, Simeon might have said to himself, "I shouldn't have done that to Joseph."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Simeon must have had a very cruel disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No matter what our disposition may be, we should not indulge in it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Simeon lost all the enjoyment of Christ through indulging in his disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He needed to share another's rich portion of Christ, the rich portion of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because "the part of the children of Judah was too much for them," Simeon was scattered among the people of Judah Josh 19:1, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>d Levi Receiving the Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>because of His Faithfulness to the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although Simeon and Levi were companions, Levi eventually took the opportunity to have his natural disposition changed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Both Simeon and Levi had a disposition to kill others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But at the time the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf, Levi's killing disposition was used by God Exo 32:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Moses came down from the mountain with the tablets and saw the people worshipping the golden calf, he said, "Who is on the Lord's side?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let him come unto me" Exo 32:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Out of all the tribes, only one tribe, the tribe of Levi, gathered together unto Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why did Simeon not join Levi?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were of the same natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, when God's call came, one answered it, and the other refused to respond.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that, although we may have a very ugly disposition, our disposition may still be useful in God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, there are certain conditions that must be met.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Firstly, we must consecrate ourselves; secondly, we must exercise our disposition against our natural likes and dislikes; and thirdly, we must use our disposition in a renewed, transformed way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the inhabitants of the city of Shechem were Levi's enemies, it was easy for him to kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But it was quite another matter to kill parents, brothers, sons, and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to do this, you must exercise your disposition against your desire and use it in a new way, a way that is both for God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both Simeon and Levi, having a killing disposition, were able to slay others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the slaying of the men in Shechem did not require them to exercise their disposition against their own desire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Simeon did not join Levi in carrying out Moses' command because he was not willing to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Simeon might have said, "It was all right to kill the people of Shechem, but it is crazy to kill our brothers, our children, and our relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yes, they all worshipped the idol.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But God is merciful, and He will forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why must we kill them?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time, these two companions were separated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The one used his natural disposition for God, with God, and in a new way, and the other did not.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Levi used his disposition in the way of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, Levi's natural disposition, his slaying disposition, was transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not think it is impossible for your disposition to be used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It may be used by Him if you use it against your natural desire and in a transformed way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have known some brothers whose will was very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Perhaps you would say that their will was stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But because their stubborn will was used for God, with God, and in a new way, they were used by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God cannot use one whose will is like jelly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such a will must be transformed into steel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The principle here is that our natural disposition can be changed and used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Levi not only slaughtered the men of Shechem, but also hamstrung their oxen.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through transformation work a disposition was not only used by God to kill the idol worshippers, but also to slay the sacrifices for offerings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our natural disposition will be useful if three conditions are met: consecration, using it against our natural desire, and using it in a renewed and transformed way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because Levi's disposition was changed, he became a great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's Thummim and Urim were with him Deut 33:8 , and he had the privilege of coming into the presence of God to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although the double portion of the land is rich, the privilege of entering God's presence is intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The priesthood can be considered as the sweet portion of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Levi received this portion.</S>
