<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. The Closing of the Way to the Tree of Life</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) The Reason</H2><P>Although we have seen the ordination of sufferings to restrict, rescue, and guard us and although we have seen the anticipated redemption, there is still a practical problem: What about the tree of life? Can the way to the tree of life be left open to fallen and sinful people?</P><P>Although Adam and Eve had the anticipated redemption, they did not then have the actual redemption. They were still sinful in nature. If they, being corrupted in nature, had eaten of the tree of life while in that condition, they would have lived forever with their sinful nature. God did not allow that. The tree of life signifying God must not be touched by sinful man. Thus, before the actual redemption was accomplished, God had to close the way to the tree of life. Once the actual redemption had been completed, access to the tree of life would again be possible. Thus, Genesis tells us that after God had prepared the anticipated redemption for man, He closed the way to the tree of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Means</H2><P>It is very meaningful to consider the manner in which God barred the way to the tree of life. In figure, God closed the way by means of cherubim and a flaming sword. Here we see three items: the cherubim, the flame, and the sword. As we have said previously regarding other items in these chapters of Genesis, we must allegorize all of the figures in Genesis 3. It is absolutely correct to allegorize the Old Testament, for both the Lord Jesus and the Apostle Paul did this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>a) The Cherubim&#151;the Glory of God</H2><P>If we read Ezekiel 9 and 10 and Hebrews 9, we will see that the cherubim are symbols of God's glory. Ezekiel 9:3 reveals that glory of God was with the cherub, and Hebrews 9:5 even speaks of "the cherubim of glory," because they were used by God to signify, express, and indicate His glory. Therefore, the way to the tree of life was closed by the cherubim, meaning that it was closed by God's glory. God's glory did not allow sinful man to touch Him before the actual redemption had been accomplished. In Romans 3:23 Paul says that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. So it was God's glory which closed the way to the tree of life. God's glory would not allow any sinful person who was short of His glory to contact Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>b) The Flame&#151;the Holiness of God</H2><P>The flame means fire, and fire in typology signifies the holiness of God. God is a consuming fire (Deut. 4:24; 9:3; Heb. 12:29). Anything common, unclean, or sinful is consumed by Him. This consuming fire signifies God's holiness, and without holiness no man shall see Him (Heb. 12:14). Thus, the second item which closed the way to the tree of life was God's holiness.</P>
