   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Perfecting Others in the Group Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a big difference between a group meeting that is mechanical and one that is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A group meeting that is mechanical is one in which everyone comes to the meeting place one after another at the assigned date and time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The early ones are waiting there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The late ones also sit there watching the ceiling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everyone is there waiting for someone to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ten minutes ago, the time to start the meeting may have passed, but the meeting still has not begun.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Reluctantly, a hymn is called, and a little reluctant prayer is offered up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After this, the leading one would ask everyone to read the Truth Lessons, paragraph by paragraph, one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of group meeting is equivalent to a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is mechanical, and it is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>An organic group meeting should start from the morning revival.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we wake up, we should call, "O Lord Jesus.''</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During the day, we should live in an overcoming way and should walk according to the spirit and live in fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the evening after dinner, we should go to the group meeting nearby with singing and praising.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, the group meeting should have started with us already by that time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may be the first one to arrive at the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we sing and pray just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When other brothers and sisters come, they will join in. After a while, a brother may come in and say, "Sorry, excuse me for the interruption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A brother just had a car accident.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is now in the hospital.''</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may then say, "Let us all pray.''</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While we pray, another, a young sister, may come in and say, "Fortunately, the brother who had the accident was not seriously injured.''</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When she brings us this news, we have more fellowship, and we turn to more prayer and thanksgiving for this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is fellowship, prayer, and the mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Following this, a new one may ask a question, saying, "I was saved last week.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not understand what the meaning of the anointing is.''</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After this question is raised, there should be more than one who answer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every attendant in the meeting can answer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A sister may first say, "I was saved recently also.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To me, the anointing is the prompting of the Holy Spirit within us.''</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although this is only one sentence, there is teaching contained in this word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Another, a brother, may say, "The prompting of the Holy Spirit is an operation within us, and this operation is the anointing.''</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After the first sister gives some teaching, a second brother adds on with something, and then another sister adds in something more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way, everyone speaks, and everyone teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the attendants put in their little bit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After six or seven minutes, everyone has taught something, and the subject is clearly covered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There may be some experienced brothers in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They may add a word lasting for a minute or more.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will give a clearer explanation to the matter of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such a one may say, "This anointing oil is typified by the holy ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It contains different kinds of ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They typify the fact that in the Holy Spirit today there is the element of the Lord Jesus: the element of humanity, the element of death, and the element of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today, through the operation of the Holy Spirit, all these rich elements are brought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as we would go along with the anointing, we can enjoy God, and we can enjoy the humanity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord's death will work in us, and the Lord's resurrection will strengthen us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this way, we will receive all these rich elements into us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All these are the results of our obedience to the anointing.''</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After this, another sister may ask, "Is this prompting of the Holy Spirit once for all, or does it happen again and again?''</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Based on the principle we have discussed, everyone can answer and fellowship some more.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the two questions mentioned, one has to do with the truth, and the other has to do with the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we bring the new ones to this kind of group meeting, they will see how the saints fellowship, pray, and care for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the same time, they will hear the truth and will be led further on to pursue life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If they do this week after week for fifty-two weeks in a year, they will spontaneously learn many things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the same time, the care among the brothers and sisters will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After half a year, a new one can begin to attend the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When he sees the others prophesy in the meetings, he will also gradually learn to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In another half a year, he will be able to speak even more.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way, he will be fully perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the group meeting had fifteen people half a year ago, and now it has increased in number to twenty-nine, it can be divided into two group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They should seek the Lord's guidance for the way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If all fifteen people within this group know each other well, and there are no new ones, they should go out to preach the gospel by knocking on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When they gain some new ones, they should all care for them together.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some new ones may eventually pass away, or move abroad, or relocate to another city, in which case the brothers and sisters should go out again to preach the gospel by visiting more people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In brief, every one of us should be caring for, helping, and perfecting three or four newly saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A CHRISTIAN CARING FOR BOTH LIFE AND THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What I have fellowshipped with you is the way that the Lord has shown us during the past four years.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We see from John 15 that we are all branches of the vine v. 5 . The destiny of the branches is to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No matter how much you say that you enjoy the Lord, if you do not bear fruit, there is something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Moreover, if a branch does not bear fruit, it will be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This does not refer to perdition, but to the loss of the rich enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We know that the Christian life is two-sided.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>On the one hand, as a branch in the vine, a Christian should absorb the riches of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the other hand, as a branch he must bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord Jesus said, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain'' v. 16 . Hence, a Christian must match his gospel preaching with life, and he must also realize that life supplies us for the purpose of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In this way, we will become balanced Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many times, when we pursue after life, we forget about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At other times, when we are zealous for the gospel, we neglect life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Both are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We can never neglect the pursuit after life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But the pursuit after life should supply us to the extent that we will go forth to preach the gospel, to bear fruit, and to have the fruit remain.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This means that not only do we need to preach the gospel, but we should have the nourishment and care in the home meetings, and we should bring the new ones to the group meetings for help and perfecting and also to the church meetings, so that this life can receive all the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>By this, the church as the organic Body of Christ will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Quezon City, Philippines, on March 25, 1989</S>
