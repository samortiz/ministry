<h1 class="title">THE REQUIREMENTS ON THE BELIEVERS<br />
FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:26; Eph. 5:18-21; Acts 10:46; 1 Cor. 14:22, 5, 13; Acts 13:52; Rom. 8:4; Col. 3:16; Acts 8:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TO MEET AS ORDAINED BY THE APOSTLE</h2>
<p>In this message we will consider the requirements on the believers for the church meetings. In order to have the church meetings, we attendants must meet the requirements. The way to meet is ordained by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:26. This verse should be considered as Paul&rsquo;s ordination of the way for us to meet.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not with a Definite Speaker</h2>
<p>According to this verse, our meetings should not have a definite speaker. To set up a definite speaker annuls the functions of all the attendants in the meeting. In the past, especially on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, our meetings were arranged with a definite speaker. Knowing that a particular brother was going to speak, all the saints would come to the meeting to listen and relax. For the speaker, however, every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning was a time of suffering. Whoever was selected and assigned to speak on the Lord&rsquo;s Day might have worried for three days. Saturday was a &ldquo;sad day&rdquo; for him. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day this speaker came to the meeting under a heavy burden, while all the other believers rested and relaxed.</p>
<p>To meet by assigning a particular speaker kept all the other saints out of a job. If this type of meeting had taken place only three months a year, there would have been nine months left for the saints to practice speaking. But this kind of meeting with a definite speaker continued all year long. After a year&rsquo;s time, the saints who attended these meetings hardly learned anything. Although the saints undoubtedly receive some help from the speaker for their nourishment, meeting in this way throughout the entire year, year after year, paralyzes the members of Christ.</p>
<p>When we began to practice the biblical way to meet, the way ordained by the apostle, certain ones became concerned. They said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you have to be merciful with us. You are the expert in speaking, but we are not. We really don&rsquo;t know what to speak. We like the feeding. Be merciful to us and keep the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting. Otherwise, we will not have any place to get some spiritual food.&rdquo; I reassured such ones that this meeting would be preserved for their sakes, and asked them to continue to come. However, I told them that at the same time they had to learn to speak in the meetings and that trainings would be set up to train them how to speak. We should try our best to learn to speak. Many nursing mothers teach their little babies to say &ldquo;ma&rdquo; and &ldquo;pa.&rdquo; After a certain time, without a dictionary, the baby knows that &ldquo;ma&rdquo; is the mother and &ldquo;pa&rdquo; is the father. He understands by listening. Word by word the baby will grow to be a good speaker. On the one hand, a church has to be a teaching church, and on the other hand, it must be a speaking church. A proper church is always teaching, and it is always speaking. A good mother will teach and speak to her baby all day long. Whenever she feeds it, she will also teach it. When the baby says &ldquo;ma&rdquo; one day, the mother is very happy.</p>
<p>We may teach the young believers to firstly say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Then we may teach them to say, &ldquo;Lord, I love You&rdquo;; &ldquo;O Lord, how good You are&rdquo;; and &ldquo;O Lord, I just worship You and want to speak You.&rdquo; Then charge them to speak these things and to learn to practice speaking in their homes. Later, you may teach them something further, as a teacher teaches a child, lesson by lesson. Do not take the old way, speaking messages to them for fifty-two weeks out of the year. Then the function of the listeners will become annulled, and spiritually speaking, they will lose the ability of their speaking organ.</p>
<p>If a baby never heard any speaking and never practiced speaking, he would grow up to be dumb. A little babe needs to hear his parents speaking for a period of time before he can make the appropriate sounds. The mother may say &ldquo;ma&rdquo; for one month without this response from the child. But one day the child says &ldquo;ma&rdquo; to his mother, and the mother is so happy. Following this she may teach the baby to say &ldquo;pa,&rdquo; and after a period of time the baby will begin to call his father &ldquo;pa.&rdquo; A child has its organic function to speak by birth, and this organic function needs development. If this development is by English, the child will always speak English. If this development is by Chinese, the child will always speak Chinese. If we develop all the new ones with the heavenly language, after two or three months, they will speak the heavenly things and know the heavenly language. It is not a small thing to drop the old way of meeting. On the one hand, this way helps to a certain extent. But on the other hand, it annuls and kills. We must build up another category of help that not only helps but also develops. Even when I minister the word in a ministry meeting, I believe that my speaking feeds the saints and also develops them.</p>
<p>I went back to Taipei in 1984 to bring the church there fully into the scriptural way of meeting and serving. In 1985 I encouraged the church to use the <em>Truth Lessons.</em> The church in Taipei has twenty-three halls, and I was staying in Hall One. When I first went to visit their Lord&rsquo;s Day morning truth lesson meeting, I was fully disappointed. One brother was directing the saints by assigning them certain portions to read. The meeting was full of deadness and routine. According to my feeling they were in the meeting as robots, not as living members. Close to two years later, I heard people highly appraising the way Hall One was practicing their truth lesson. They said it was so wonderful, living, refreshing, new, and high. I went back to visit this meeting, and I was surprised at the saints&rsquo; livingness. They read by repeating and by emphasizing. Their reading was so living. Sometimes one saint would read only half of a sentence, and another saint would spontaneously continue this sentence. There was a good flow and continuation in their reading. They pray-read in a living way. This confirmed to me that our organic functions need to be developed.</p>
<p>In the church we must learn to develop the saints&rsquo; organic function, and we need to charge the saints to be patient in learning how to exercise their function. We need to be like the mothers who teach their little ones to exercise their function which they received at their birth. They have the function to see, to hear, to speak, to crawl, and eventually to stand, walk, and run. The mothers need to help develop these functions in their children. Eventually the little ones learn how to develop their own functions.</p>
<p>The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are presently in a transitory period. We should not think that we can immediately close the door of the meeting hall on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, send all the saints to their homes, and expect them to have good home meetings. I observed that when the brothers did this, the home meetings were dumb meetings. The meeting hall was closed and everybody was sent to their homes to sit there. Eventually, refreshments were brought out of the kitchen and the saints began to talk about things other than Christ. Everyone became disappointed with this so-called meeting. We should not close the meeting hall abruptly and tell the saints to meet in their homes instead. We still need to keep the meeting in the hall. Use the entire meeting hall to teach the saints so that they can practice and learn to develop their organic function. We need to do everything we can by the Lord&rsquo;s grace to change our way of meeting to the scriptural way.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee said that this old way to meet with a definite speaker and the others listening had become a strong habit. Because this old way was too heavy for one person to remove, Brother Nee said that we needed many brothers to push. A certain object may be very heavy and difficult to remove from the way, but if many of us push against it, we will be able to push it out of the way. However, just to push away our old habit is not sufficient. We need something to replace it. If we push away our old habit and we have nothing to replace it, we are left with nothing, vanity. Vanity cannot help people. Thus, we need to build up something to replace our old way, our old habit. What is this something? Speaking! We all must learn to speak Christ. Even the young sisters need to learn to speak.</p>
