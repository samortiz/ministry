[1]  CONTENTS God's Eternal Purpose Christ Being All The Church as the New Man The Seven Spirits of God and Our Spirit In the Spirit The Economy of the Triune God The Power of Resurrection The Perfecting of the Gifts Washing, Nourishing, and Cherishing Standing and Slaying
[2]  This book is composed of messages given in Chinese by Brother Witness Lee in a young people's training in the church in Taipei on September 1-5, 1975.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE Scripture Reading: Eph 1:5, 8-11; 3:3-6; 5:17; Col 1:9b; 2:2b; 1 Cor 2:7; Rev 4:11b; Rom 12:2; Matt 6:10 THE MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE AND HUMAN LIFE
[4]  The verses listed above show us God's eternal purpose, God's eternal plan.
[5]  If as a young person you are somewhat thoughtful, you do not need to be a great philosopher to eventually ask questions such as, "What is the meaning of my life in the world?" and, "For what purpose was I born?"
[6]  CHRIST AS THE EXPLANATION OF GOD AND THE UPHOLDER OF ALL THINGS
[7]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST BEING ALL Scripture Reading: Isa 9:6; Matt 11:27; 16:15-16; John 3:31, 35; 17:5; Acts 10:36b; Col 1:15-19; 2:2b, 9; 3:10-11; Eph 1:20-23
[8]  Everyone who believes in the Lord, serves Him, and follows Him needs to see God's eternal purpose.
[9]  If we do not have a part in this universal man, our human life is meaningless, and all that we have is vanity.
[10]  To see Christ is not merely to listen to a message or to read a book about Christ but to see Christ in spirit.
[11]  Our inner eyes need to be opened to see what Christ is, who Christ is, and what Christ is all about.
[12]  Because Christ is all, the revelation in the Bible concerning Him is unlimited.
[13]  Ephesians chapter three reveals that even the dimensions of the universe the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth are Christ v. 18 . No one can tell how wide the universe is.
[14]  In his old age Paul wrote in Philippians 3 that he wanted to "know" Christ v. 10a . Paul knew Christ much more than we do, yet at that time he still wanted to know more of Christ.
[15]  Finally, since Christ is all, Christ must be the real me.
[16]  You must say, "Yes, Christ is me because Christ is all, and I am included in all!"
[17]  CHAPTER THREE THE CHURCH AS THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18-19; Eph 1:22-23; 2:15-16, 21-22; 3:4-6; 4:4-6, 22-24; 5:25-27, 32; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Rev 1:11 CHRIST BEING THE SPIRIT
[18]  In the previous messages we stated that we must see God's eternal purpose and that we must also see Christ.
[19]  The term Christ has become too common among people today.
[20]  Although we may know the Bible very well, we may not have a thorough and real knowledge of Christ.
[21]  If you know Christ, then you must also know the church.
[22]  Matthew chapter sixteen shows us that if you know Christ, you need to also know the church.
[23]  Peter said to the Lord, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . Then the Lord answered him, "I also say to you upon this rock I will build My church" v. 18 . Then, after mentioning the church, He went on to speak concerning the kingdom of the heavens.
[24]  NOT NEEDING HELP FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT NEEDING TO TURN TO OUR SPIRIT
[25]  We do not need the brothers and sisters to help us put off the old man.
[26]  Ephesians only says that we should put off the old man and put on the new man.
[27]  CHAPTER FOUR THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD AND OUR SPIRIT THE CHURCH AS THE NEW MAN BEING ALTOGETHER A MATTER IN SPIRIT
[28]  We must see that the church is the new man.
[29]  In the past we clearly pointed out that the church is the Body.
[30]  It was not until recently that the Lord clearly showed us that the church is not only the Body but also the new man.
[31]  In this verse we may also see a link, although this verse is not directly about the church but about Christ, because verse 12 explicitly says that the Body is Christ.
[32]  Verse 9, which is a wonderful Bible verse, says, "For here is the stone that I have set before Joshua upon one stone are seven eyes."
[33]  Now we must find out what the seven eyes are.
[34]  Zechariah 4:2 says, "And he said to me, What do you see?
[35]  These verses show us that the lampstand in Zechariah 4 signifies the Spirit.
[36]  When we contact the seven Spirits, we contact the stone, that is, we contact Christ, and we contact God, because the seven Spirits infuse God and Christ into us.
[37]  Now let us come back to the wonderful book of Zechariah.
[38]  Zechariah 12:1 says, "Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him."
[39]  This is the only verse in the entire Bible that specifically indicates that God formed the spirit of man within him.
[40]  CHAPTER FIVE IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Eph 3:5; 1:17, 19; 2:22; 3:16-19; 4:22-24; 5:18-19; 6:18-19 THE CHURCH AS THE REPRINT OF THE SPIRIT
[41]  We have seen that the reality and substance of the church is the Spirit.
[42]  If you do not have the dispensing of the Spirit, and if you do not allow the seven Spirits to shine in you thoroughly, transfusing God into you richly that you may become His reproduction, then you are not in the reality of the church.
[43]  RECEIVING THE REPRINTING OF THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT
[44]  To print a book or a newspaper, one needs not only a printing plate but also good paper.
[45]  Ephesians 4:23 says, "And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind."
[46]  It is good to turn to our spirit, but unless our mind is one with our spirit and is under the control of our spirit, our spirit is merely our spirit and not yet the spirit of our mind.
[47]  CHAPTER SIX THE ECONOMY OF THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: Eph 3:4-6, 8-11, 16-21
[48]  In the preceding messages we have seen God's eternal plan, Christ, the Spirit, and our spirit.
[49]  In order to meet the need of the Lord's recovery in this age, we as Christians must see these four matters God's eternal plan, Christ, the Spirit, and our spirit.
[50]  In this message we will see how God is working Himself into us to make us one with Him so that He may be our life and we may be His expression.
[51]  Then, it mentions the Spirit: "To be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man" v. 16b . Finally, it mentions Christ: "That Christ may make His home in your hearts" v. 17a . The result is that "you may be filled unto all the fullness of God" v. 19b . This prayer is truly concerning the Triune God first concerning the Spirit, then concerning Christ, and lastly concerning God: "To be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God." The Trinity is not merely a doctrine.
[52]  We must see that it is necessary for God to be in Christ, for Christ to be the Spirit, and for the Spirit to enter into our spirit, to operate in us and to strengthen us into our spirit.
[53]  This is not a doctrine; this is God's economy.
[54]  Therefore, verse 21 says, "To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus."
[55]  If we faithfully let the Spirit strengthen us into our inner man, let Christ make His home in our hearts, and let God fill us, then day by day our old man will be gradually put off.
[56]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE POWER OF RESURRECTION THE HISTORY OF THE RECOVERY OF SPIRITUAL LIFE
[57]  In this message we will fellowship concerning the history of the Lord's recovery of spiritual life.
[58]  At that time God raised up people in the Roman Catholic Church such as Madame Guyon who also reacted in life.
[59]  What I would like to share with you now is a personal testimony of turning to the spirit.
[60]  I hope that you will take it in and be impressed with it.
[61]  The Lord has shown me that in our relationship with Him, in our spiritual life, and in our church life, everything hinges on Him as the Spirit entering into our spirit and upon our living by this Spirit to enjoy all His riches.
[62]  Let us consider the positive matters that are revealed in Ephesians.
[63]  Chapter one says that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all v. 23 . The Brethren saw the matter of the church as the Body of Christ as early as the nineteenth century.
[64]  Therefore, chapter three speaks concerning the riches of Christ v. 8 . If you read all the books in Christianity, you would not find one book on the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[65]  Ephesians 1:17-20 says, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, the eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies."
[66]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE PERFECTING OF THE GIFTS OUR NATURAL CONCEPT HINDERING US FROM RECEIVING REVELATION
[67]  Ephesians is a book that requires revelation because the matters it speaks about are high and profound and are not according to our natural concepts or religious thoughts.
[68]  For this reason we may read Ephesians once, twice, or even a hundred times without anything echoing within our being.
[69]  HUMAN PERFECTING BEING UNABLE TO MANIFEST THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MEMBERS
[70]  The church is both the Body and the new man, and it grows by the riches and the power that are in the church.
[71]  After we receive the riches and the power, our feet can walk, our hands can do things, our eyes can look at people, and our mouth can speak.
[72]  Each Member Growing and Being Perfected through the Supply
[73]  It is this supply that causes each member to become a useful and functioning member.
[74]  CHAPTER NINE WASHING, NOURISHING, AND CHERISHING Scripture Reading: Eph 5:25-27, 29 NATURAL CONCEPTS HINDERING US FROM RECEIVING REVELATION
[75]  In the previous message we said, by way of indication, by way of inference, that the matter of eating is referred to in Ephesians chapter four.
[76]  If we want to grow, we must eat, for our body grows by our eating.
[77]  Ephesians 4 reveals that the perfecting of the gifts is to cause us to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things.
[78]  They said, "How can this man give us His flesh to eat?" v. 52 . Even many of His disciples said, "This word is hard; who can hear it?" v. 60 . In response to these words, the Lord said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing" v. 63a . Moreover, sympathizing with their weakness, He went on to say, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" v. 63b . Although the Lord spoke these words, Christianity has made the Lord's words into doctrine.
[79]  LETTING CHRIST, WHO IS ALREADY IN US, GROW AND SPREAD OUT OF US
[80]  Today in His recovery the Lord truly desires to bring His church into revelation.
[81]  Our eyes must be opened by God to see that Christ has come into us to be our all.
[82]  What we have been touching in these messages is a matter of revelation.
[83]  In addition to these four visions, we also need to see clearly that God does not want anything from us.
[84]  Recently I fellowshipped with some brothers, saying, "To eat Christ we need to pray-read; to eat Christ we need to call on the Lord's name; to eat Christ we need to turn to our spirit; and to eat Christ we need to pray a great deal.
[85]  If you have the revelation if you have seen clearly that Christ has been sown into you, that all the riches of Christ are in you, and that the great power is already in you then the more you were prohibited from outward activities, the more you would appreciate this revelation.
[86]  Now let us consider a few verses from chapter five of Ephesians vv.
[87]  These verses show us again that the church is the Body of Christ, and we all are members of the Body.
[88]  In addition to being cleansed, we also need to be nourished and cherished.
[89]  In this final message we want to look at the last chapter of Ephesians.
[90]  If others in the church still like to hear good sermons or messages, you need to stand and not be dragged down by them.
[91]  Two days ago I heard someone share that the church is a restaurant.
[92]  Now let us go further to see a supplementary point, a point concerning spiritual warfare.
[93]  In spiritual warfare we need to put on the whole armor of God, and the last two items in the armor of God are the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit.
