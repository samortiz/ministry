   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAMPSTAND AND THE SEVEN LAMPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The lampstand was a very crucial item in the tabernacle because it directed people to the ark in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Consider the arrangement of the furnishings in the tabernacle and the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Firstly, in the outer court there were the altar and the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then, in the Holy Place, there were the showbread table and the lampstand with seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The lampstand directed people into the Holy of Holies; it pointed the way to the law of life in the ark of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we had only the book of Exodus, we would not be able to understand the significance of the lampstand and its seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in Zechariah 3 and 4 the lampstand with its lamps appears again as a development of the lampstand in Exodus 25.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Zechariah 3:9 we have the seven eyes on the stone, and in 4:10 we see that these seven eyes are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we put Zechariah 4:10 with Zechariah 4:2, we see that the seven lamps of the lampstand are also the seven eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, in Zechariah the seven lamps in Exodus are developed into the seven eyes of Jehovah, the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, these seven lamps are the seven eyes of the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in Zechariah the seven lamps are developed into seven eyes, and the lampstand is developed into the stone and into Jehovah, the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the seven lamps are the seven eyes, and the lampstand is the stone, Jehovah, the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we have not only the seven lamps, but also the seven eyes; not only the lampstand, but also the stone, Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This implies that the seven lamps are the seven eyes and that the lampstand is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE STONE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we have pointed out a number of times, the matter of the stone is developed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here the Lord refers to Himself as the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Matthew 21:42 He said, Have you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the cornerstone; this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The stone referred to here is the very stone with the seven eyes in Zechariah 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter spoke of the Lord as this stone in Acts 4:11, where he said, This is the stone which was despised by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter was telling the religionists that they rejected not only their Redeemer, but also the cornerstone of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>OF THE SEVEN LAMPS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Revelation 4 and 5 we have a further development of the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to 4:5, the seven lamps of the lampstand are seven lamps of fire burning before the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The seven lamps on the lampstand were for enlightening, but the seven lamps before the throne of God are both for enlightening and for the carrying out of God s administrative government.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 5:6 indicates that the seven lamps burning before the throne are also the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, the seven eyes are the seven eyes of the stone, the seven eyes of the Lord, and the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These seven eyes combine the stone, the Lord, and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that the Lamb is the stone and that the stone is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moreover, 5:6 reveals that the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, there is a line containing six items: the lampstand, the stone, Jehovah, the Lamb, the throne of God, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the other hand, there is another line with three items: the seven lamps, the seven eyes, and the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The lampstand signifies shining, and the stone refers to God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jesus, our Savior, is Jehovah, and the Redeemer is the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The throne of God indicates God s government, God s administration.</S>
