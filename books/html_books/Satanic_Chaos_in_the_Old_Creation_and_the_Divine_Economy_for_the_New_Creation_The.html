Such a subject may seem quite peculiar, strange, and extraordinary. The burden of the messages in this book can be expressed in two sets of four statements. The first set concerns the divine economy and the satanic chaos:</P><p>1) Christ is the centrality and universality of the divine economy.<br>2) Satan, the devil, is the source and element of the evil chaos.<br>3) The believers must condemn the earthly chaos and exalt the heavenly economy.<br>4) The overcomers conquer all the destructive chaos and triumph in the unique constructive economy.</p><P>The second set of statements concerns the overcomer:</P><P>1) To the overcomer, Christ will give to eat of the tree of life in the Paradise of God (Rev. 2:7).<br>2) To the overcomer, Christ will give of the hidden manna with a white stone for God's building (Rev. 2:17).<br>3) The overcomer, Christ will make a pillar in God's temple, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 3:12).<br>4) The overcomer will dine with Christ, and to him Christ will give to sit with Him on His throne (Rev. 3:20-21).</P><P>In this message I would like first to give an introductory word and then consider the divine economy and the satanic chaos in the Old Testament. I hope that this opening word will give us a governing and controlling vision, a vision that will help us to understand all the matters that we will cover in these messages.</P><P>Before we were saved, we all, old and young, male and female, were in a condition of chaos. Every year, every day, and even every moment we were in a chaotic situation. But one day something else came into us, and this thing is the divine economy. We repented to God, confessed our sins, failures, mistakes, and wrongdoings, and received the Lord Jesus. Upon our receiving of the Lord Jesus, something wonderful, heavenly, and divine came into us. We may say that Christ came into us. We may also say that the Holy Spirit or the Divine Trinity came into us. Yes, the One who came into us is Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Divine Trinity. Now we need to see that this One is the divine economy. This means that God is our economy. You have heard that Jesus Christ is our Savior, Lord, and Master and that He is our life, nature, and person, but probably you have never heard that Jesus Christ is also the divine economy. Thus, we need to realize that when we were saved, the divine economy came into us.</P><P>In the New Testament the word economy, an anglicized form of the Greek word oikonomia, is strongly used. For instance, this word is used in Ephesians 3, a chapter which reveals that the riches of Christ are preached to the nations so that the church can come into being. Verse 9 speaks of "the economy of the mystery."</P><P>Oikonomia is composed of two Greek words: oikos, meaning house, and nomos, meaning law. Hence, an oikonomia is a house law, a family administration. Some versions translate oikonomia as "administration," and others as "arrangement" or "plan." God's economy is His plan, His administration, His arrangement.</P><P>The situation into which we were born was altogether messy and chaotic. There was no administration or arrangement or plan. We did not know what to do, where to go, or what kind of person we should be. This was my situation before I was saved. But one day, while I was in such a chaotic condition, the gospel, the glad tidings, came to me. I attended a gospel meeting where I heard about God, the Lord Jesus, and Satan typified by Pharaoh. I was caught by the Lord and I prayed to Him. Immediately after I prayed, something bright and shining, something of splendor, came into me. As I was walking home after the meeting, I stopped on the street and said, "God, from today I would like to be Your preacher. I do not want to be anything else. I just want to preach Christ." The Triune God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the divine life had come into me. Also, the divine economy had come into me as a kind of administration, arrangement, and plan that put everything in order. I was joyful, and I was in an orderly situation.</P><P>However, my initial feeling of joy did not last long. A few days later I became angry with my mother. My anger troubled me, and I had no peace. Instead of economy, I had chaos once again. Eventually I prayed to the Lord about this and was forgiven. The peace returned, and I had the sense of something bright, pleasant, and lovely within. At that time, I did not know about the divine economy, but I was experiencing it.</P><P>Do you know what the Christian life is? The Christian life is a life of economy mixed with chaos. The economy is divine, and the chaos is satanic. Hence, the Christian life involves both the divine economy and the satanic chaos. The Christian life is a history of economy and chaos, of chaos and economy. During our time with the Lord in the morning, we experience economy, but later in the day we may experience chaos.</P><P>This has been my experience during the nearly seventy years I have been a Christian. However, I am learning the secret, the strategy, of defeating chaos and of coming back to economy and order. I am learning how to be filled not with chaos but with economy. I have not only God's economy within me&#151;I have God as my economy within me. The very God who dwells in me is my economy.</P><P>As a mixture of economy and chaos, the Christian life is a miniature of the entire universe. The history of the universe is a history of God's economy and Satan's chaos. Furthermore, the entire Bible, from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation, is a record of the divine economy and the satanic chaos. In our married life we also have the economy of God and the chaos of Satan. The reason for this situation is that in the universe there are two sources&#151;God and Satan.</P><P>Sometimes when we preach the gospel to thoughtful people, they ask us why there are these two sources. Such people may say, "Why is there Satan as well as God? God is good, but Satan is evil. If there were no Satan, everything would be fine." Others may ask why there were two trees in the garden of Eden&#151;the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, a tree that involves knowledge, good, evil, and death. To the ones who ask these questions I would say, "You should go to God and ask Him. I do not know the answer to your questions. However, I do know that the history of the universe is a history of God's economy and Satan's chaos."</P><P>In order to understand the divine economy and the satanic chaos, we need to see the difference between the old creation and the new creation. God created the heavens and the earth, and this became His first creation. God's first creation eventually became old and involved with death, for to become old is to become dead. In a sense, the words first, old, and dead are synonyms.</P><P>The first creation did not accomplish God's purpose directly. Rather, it was God's intention to gain the new creation through the first creation. This means that through the old creation God will have a new creation. Concerning this, in 2 Corinthians 5:17 Paul says, "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation." Galatians 6:15 says, "Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters." We were the old man, but we have been regenerated to become the new man, and the new man is the new creation.</P><P>Although God created the heavens and the earth, He was not in the old creation. This means that the old creation does not have God as its life, nature, and person. But in the new creation we have God within us as our life, our nature, our person, and our everything. Do we need love? Our God within us is love. Do we need light? Our God within us is light. Do we need the divine attributes? Our God within us is the divine attributes, which will be expressed in our human virtues. Therefore, in the new creation God is everything.</P><P>God's intention is to produce the new creation out of the old creation. The universe exists for this purpose, this goal. God created the first creation, which has become the old creation. Now out of the old creation He is producing the new creation. This new creation is something that is mingled with Him.</P><P>In order to produce the new creation out of the old creation, God first came into the old creation as a man. Then He lived in the old creation as a man for thirty-three and a half years. He died in the old creation and then was resurrected. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) to enter into all His believers, who were the old creation, to make them something new. This means that all His believers have received Him as the divine economy for the new creation.</P><P>Our becoming a new creation in Christ began with our regeneration, and it continues with our being sanctified, renewed, and transformed. Eventually, we will be conformed to the image of Christ and glorified. That will be the consummation of the new creation.</P><P>According to the Bible, the old creation must pass through four ages: the age before the law, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom. As believers in Christ, we are now in the third age, the age of grace, expecting to enter into the age of the kingdom. God uses these four ages to gain the new creation out of the old creation.</P><P>Today the earth is filled with chaos. Chaos is everywhere. Every part of society is chaotic. However, we should not be discouraged. In addition to the satanic chaos, there is the divine economy. Whereas the satanic chaos will come to an end, the divine economy will reach a consummation. The end of the satanic chaos will be the lake of fire, and the consummation of the divine economy will be the New Jerusalem.</P><P>We need to realize that, both in the Bible and in our experience, the satanic chaos always goes along with the divine economy. It seems that we alternate between economy and chaos, between chaos and economy. Where there is the divine economy, there is the satanic chaos. Where God is, Satan is also. Satan is not behind God, following Him; rather, Satan is at God's side. We may say that God is in the "central lane" and Satan is in the "side lane."</P><P>Let us now go on to consider the record of the divine economy and the satanic chaos from Genesis to Malachi.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. IN THE PREADAMIC AGE</H2><P>There was an age before Adam. In that age, the preadamic age, there were the divine economy and the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Economy</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God's Creation of the Heavens and the Earth</H2><P>In the preadamic age, the creation of the heavens and the earth was a matter of the divine economy (Gen. 1:1; Job 38:4-6). Out of nothing God created the heavens and the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God's Orderly Creation Stirring Up<br>the Angels to Sing and Shout for Joy</H2><P>God's orderly creation stirred up the angels to sing and shout for joy. Job 38:7 indicates that the angels sang and rejoiced when they saw the beautiful universe which God had created.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Satanic Chaos</H2><P>In the preadamic age, the divine economy in the creation of the universe was followed by the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Satan Rebelling against God<br>and One Third of the Angels<br>Joining Him in His Rebellion</H2><P>Satan, the archangel, rebelled against God, and one third of the angels joined him in his rebellion (Isa. 14:12-15; Ezek. 28:13-18; Rev. 12:4). Since the number of angels is countless, for one third of the angels to join Satan in his rebellion means that a very large number of them followed him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Universe Becoming a Chaos<br>under God's Judgment</H2><P>After Satan's rebellion God came in to judge. The universe became a chaos under God's judgment: the heavens became dark, and the earth became waste and void (Job 9:5-7; Gen. 1:2a). Because Satan's rebellion polluted not only the earth but also the heavens, both the earth and the heavens were judged by God. The heavens became dark, and the earth became waste and void. That was chaos.</P><P>Genesis 1:1 says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." Here we see God's economy in His creation of the universe. According to the proper translation, verse 2a goes on to say, "But the earth became waste and void." This indicates that the earth had become formless, chaotic.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. IN THE RESTORED UNIVERSE</H2><P>After the satanic chaos in the preadamic age, God came in to restore the universe. In the restored universe we also see the divine economy and the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Economy</H2><P>Genesis 1:2b speaks not of God's creation but of His restoration of the chaotic universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Restoring the Heavens and the Earth</H2><P>First, God restored the heavens, particularly in its lights, and the earth, specifically in its land (Gen. 1:2b-19). The light was for the producing of life and for the preservation and growth of life. The land was also for the producing of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Creating Man<br>to Express Him and to Represent Him</H2><P>In the restored universe, God then created man to express Him in His image and to represent Him in His dominion (Gen. 1:26-28). God created man in His image so that man could express Him, and He gave man dominion so that man could represent Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. God Putting Man<br>in Front of the Tree of Life</H2><P>God put man in front of the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-17). The tree of life is a figure of Christ as the embodiment of the divine life. Thus, when God put man in front of the tree of life, He was indicating that man should take God in Christ as life for the carrying out of the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Satanic Chaos</H2><P>After the divine economy in the restored universe, we again have the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Satan as the Serpent<br>Tempting Man to Take of the Tree<br>of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</H2><P>The satanic chaos in the old creation began with Satan as the serpent tempting man to take of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 3:1-5). Both good and evil belong to the same tree, and now with the same person we can see good and also evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Man Being Deceived<br>and Becoming Fallen</H2><P>Genesis 3:6 and 7 show us that man was deceived and became fallen. This was the chaos in the restored universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. IN THE FALL OF MAN</H2><P>In the fall of man we see first the divine economy and then the issue of the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Economy</H2><P>It is a marvelous fact that even in the fall of man there was the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Promising Adam That Christ Would Come<br>as the Seed of Woman to Destroy the Serpent</H2><P>In Genesis 3, after Adam and Eve became poisoned and fallen, they were afraid of God and hid from Him. But God came to seek the fallen and lost man, calling to him and saying, "Where art thou?" (v. 9). After finding the lost and fallen man, God promised that Christ would come as the seed of woman to destroy the serpent, that is, to destroy Satan. Before God made this promise, Adam and Eve must have been trembling in fear. God had told them that if they ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they would die, and they surely must have been expecting to die. But then they heard the good news, the glad tidings, that the seed of the woman&#151;a type or prefigure of Christ&#151;would come to destroy the evil serpent. That certainly was good news. Concerning this good news, Hebrews 2:14 says, "Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Promising to Let Man Have Life<br>and Providing Man with Covering</H2><P>In the divine economy in the fall of man, God also promised to let man have life and provided man with covering (Gen. 3:20-21). The life here signifies God's eternal life, and the covering typifies God's coming redemption in Christ.</P><P>Realizing that they were sinful, Adam and Eve tried to cover their nakedness with aprons made of fig leaves. But God made them coats of skin and clothed them. God killed an animal, probably a lamb, and used the skin to make a covering for them. That was a type of His coming redemption in Christ.</P><P>In the divine economy in Genesis 3, there were two promises and a provision. God promised that one would come to destroy the serpent, and He promised to give the divine life to fallen man. Then He provided a covering to indicate that Christ would come to accomplish redemption to cover the fallen people so that they might be justified before God. This is a complete gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Issue of the Satanic Chaos</H2><P>In Genesis 3:22-24 we see that there was an issue of the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Fallen Man Being Driven Out<br>from the Garden of Eden</H2><P>In His restoration of creation, God purposely created a garden of pleasure, which was called the garden of Eden. Due to the fall, man was driven out of that garden. This was the first aspect of the issue of the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Entrance to the Tree of Life<br>Being Closed to the Fallen Man</H2><P>The second aspect of this issue was that the entrance to the tree of life was closed to the fallen man. The entrance would remain closed until Christ came to accomplish redemption and thus open again the way to the tree of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. IN THE FURTHER STEPS<br>AND CONSUMMATION OF MAN'S FALL</H2><P>In the further steps and consummation of man's fall, we see more aspects of the divine economy and the satanic chaos. The fall of man had at least four steps, and then it reached its consummation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Economy</H2><P>In the divine economy God was very kind and merciful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Abel Accepting God's Promise<br>in Offering the Firstlings of His Flock<br>to Receive God's Respect</H2><P>Abel accepted God's promise in offering the firstlings of his flock to receive God's respect (Gen. 4:4). These firstlings typified Christ. Because God regarded Abel's offering, Abel was justified and accepted by God. According to the divine economy, Abel was recovered and justified.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Enosh Calling on the Name of Jehovah<br>for His Rich Supply</H2><P>The name Enosh means fragile. Enosh, a fragile man, called on the name of Jehovah for His rich supply (Gen. 4:26). Enosh was weak, frail, and fragile. By calling on Jehovah's rich name, this fragile man received His rich supply. This certainly is something of the divine economy. Today we also practice calling on the name of the Lord. This practice began with the third generation of mankind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Enoch Walking with God<br>and Being Taken Away by God</H2><P>Enoch walked with God and was taken away by God (Gen. 5:21-24). Although man became fallen and was driven out of the garden of Eden, a fallen man could still walk with God and eventually could be taken away to God. This also is something of the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Noah Walking with God<br>and Preparing the Ark<br>for the Carrying Out of the Divine Economy</H2><P>Noah not only walked with God but also prepared an ark for the carrying out of the divine economy (Gen. 6:8-22). The ark typified Christ and was for the salvation of humankind. The human race was saved through the ark prepared by Noah according to God's revelation and instruction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Noah Building an Altar<br>and Offering Burnt Offerings to God<br>to Please Him</H2><P>According to Genesis 8:20-22, Noah built an altar and offered burnt offerings (typifying Christ) to God to please Him so that the earth could be kept in its systems. Today we also should build an altar and pray; that is, we should come to the cross and offer Christ to God. As we offer Christ to God, we should pray, "O God, forgive our country. The immorality and chaos are offenses to You, the righteous God. We ask You to remember the cross on which Your Son, our Lord Jesus, died." To come to the cross and offer Christ to God is the divine economy. If we do this, we may help to save the country in which we live.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Satanic Chaos</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Cain Rejecting God's Promise<br>and Killing His Brother Abel</H2><P>It is likely that Adam had many sons, but only two, Abel and Cain, are used in the Bible as models. Abel is a model of the divine economy, and Cain is a model of the satanic chaos.</P><P>Cain rejected God's promise and killed his brother Abel, bringing in God's judgment and curse (Gen. 4:3-16). Instead of offering something of the flock, typifying Christ, he offered the result of his own labor, and that offended God. Nothing of a sinner's own labor that is offered to the righteous God will be accepted by Him.</P><P>By offering the result of his labor to God, Cain was seemingly doing a good thing. But shortly after his offering was rejected by God, Cain did something evil&#151;he killed his brother. With him there were both good and evil, indicating that he surely belonged to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The situation is the same in human society today. On the one hand, a gentleman does many good things; on the other hand, the same person does evil things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Man Becoming Flesh<br>and Man's Sin Becoming Great</H2><P>In the further steps of the fall, man became flesh and man's sin became great, so man was judged by God with the flood (Gen. 6:3, 5-7, 13; 7:10-11, 17-23a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Man Rebelling against God,<br>Exalting Himself, and<br>Worshipping the Idols at Babel</H2><P>In the consummation of man's fall, man rebelled against God, exalted himself, and worshipped the idols at Babel in union with Satan to frustrate the divine economy (Gen. 11:1-9). Before this time, a strong man rose up by the name of Nimrod (Gen. 10:8-11). Nimrod, a type of Antichrist, built Babel and also Nineveh. Babel was a place of idols, and the names of idols were written on the bricks of the city. At Babel man rebelled against God, exalted himself, and worshipped idols.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. IN THE RAISING UP OF A NEW RACE OF MANKIND</H2><P>Let us now go on to see the divine economy and the satanic chaos in the raising up of a new race of mankind. The old race had become chaotic, so out of chaotic mankind God raised up a new race with Abraham as the head.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Economy with<br>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Calling Abraham<br>Out of the Land of Idolatry<br>and Bringing Him into the Land of His Promise</H2><P>Genesis 11:31 and 12:4 tell us that God called Abraham out of the land of idolatry and brought him into the land of His promise. The land of God's promise is the good land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Promising Abraham<br>His Blessing of the Gospel<br>to the Nations in the Seed of Abraham</H2><P>God also promised Abraham His blessing of the gospel to the nations in the seed of Abraham&#151;Christ as the centrality and universality of the divine economy (Gen. 12:2-3; 18:18; 22:18). Just as the seed of woman is Christ, so the seed of Abraham also is Christ.</P><P>Christ is the threefold seed: the seed of woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David (2 Sam. 7:12). As the seed of woman, the seed of Mary, Christ has accomplished redemption to defeat and destroy Satan and to deal with our sin and sins. As the seed of Abraham, Christ has brought God to us and has brought us to God. This is the blessing. As the seed of David, Christ has brought in the kingdom.</P><P>In this revelation concerning Christ as the threefold seed we have a full gospel. What is the gospel? The gospel is the good news that Christ has destroyed Satan, that He has redeemed us from our sins, that He has brought God to us and us to God for our enjoyment of God's blessing, and that He has brought us into the kingdom, where God reigns through His redeemed as His organism. This is the gospel regarding Christ as the threefold seed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob<br>Building an Altar for the Offerings to Jehovah<br>and Living in a Tent as Pilgrims</H2><P>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob built an altar for the offerings (typifying Christ) to Jehovah and lived in a tent as pilgrims, looking forward to the consummation of the divine economy (Gen. 12:7-8; 26:25; 33:18-20; Heb. 11:9). They built an altar to offer what God wanted&#151;the offerings as types of Christ. Their erecting a tent indicates that they never became settled on earth but instead were a traveling people, strangers to the earth. They looked forward to the New Jerusalem, a city with foundations, the consummation of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Satanic Chaos with Abraham and Jacob</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Abraham Marrying Hagar</H2><P>Abraham married Hagar (Gen. 16:1-5). This issued in the negative story of Hagar and her son Ishmael (Gen. 21:8-10). Ishmael was cast out by God, and Hagar was set aside, for she was a concubine and not a proper wife.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Jacob with His Entire Family<br>Going Down to Egypt</H2><P>Jacob with his entire family went down to Egypt. This resulted in the enslavement and tyranny of Egypt over the race of Israel (Exo. 1:8-14). The blessing is not with going down to Egypt (the world) but with going out of Egypt and going on and on until we reach the consummation of God's economy&#151;the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Divine Economy<br>with the People of Israel</H2><P>With the people of Israel&#151;a new race of mankind raised up by God&#151;we once again see the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The People of Israel<br>Passing through God's Judgment<br>and Making an Exodus from Egypt</H2><P>In the divine economy the people of Israel passed through God's judgment and made an exodus from Egypt (Exo. 12:1-14; 13:7&#151;14:31). First, God rendered them His redemption. By means of the Passover with the killing of the lamb and the striking of the blood, they passed through God's judgment. That was God's redemption. However, because they were still in Egypt, God exercised His salvation to deliver them out of the tyranny of Egypt. Thus, the children of Israel enjoyed two things&#151;God's redemption and God's salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Providing the People of Israel<br>in the Wilderness with Manna from Heaven<br>and Water out of the Moving Rock</H2><P>After the people of Israel passed through God's judgment and made their exodus from Egypt, they became a people traveling in the wilderness. As Exodus 16:1&#151;17:7 and 1 Corinthians 10:3 and 4 reveal, there in the wilderness God provided the people of Israel with manna from heaven (typifying Christ) and water (typifying the Spirit) out of the moving rock (typifying Christ). Only when they were outside of Egypt could they enjoy such provisions. This indicates that if we today are those who migrate, those who travel with the Lord, we will enjoy the blessing of His provision.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Satanic Chaos with the People of Israel</H2><P>With the people of Israel in the wilderness, we see not only the divine economy but also the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The People of Israel<br>Being Overconfident in Themselves<br>for the Keeping of God's Commandments</H2><P>The people of Israel had become blessed travelers with God, but they were overconfident in themselves for the keeping of God's commandments (Exo. 19:7-8). God brought them to Mount Sinai, where He came in to meet with them and to speak to them. Being overconfident in themselves and not knowing themselves, they said, "All that the Lord hath spoken we will do" (v. 8a). God was offended by this, for it indicated that they did not know themselves. They should have said, "O Lord, You know that we are a fallen people. We cannot keep Your word. We need Your mercy, grace, redemption, and salvation." God is pleased to hear such a word. However, what the people of Israel spoke was entirely different and was offensive to God, who then proceeded to decree the law. The people, who were so confident in themselves, broke the law even before it was given to them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The People of Israel Sidetracking Themselves<br>from the Central Line of the Divine Economy<br>to the Sideline of the Law</H2><P>In the wilderness the people of Israel sidetracked themselves from the central line of the divine economy to the sideline of the law (Exo. 20:1-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><P>Finally, let us consider the remaining aspects of the divine economy and the satanic chaos in the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Economy<br>concerning the Tabernacle,<br>the Offerings, and the Priests</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Charging the People of Israel<br>to Build the Tabernacle for His Dwelling and<br>to Serve Him by the Priests through the Offerings</H2><P>In Exodus 25&#151;Leviticus 27 God charged the people of Israel to build the tabernacle for His dwelling and to serve Him by the priests through the offerings. The tabernacle, the priests, and the offerings all typify Christ. Even in the Old Testament, God's people did not live only by the law but also through the tabernacle, the priests, and the offerings. If they had lived only by the law, all of them would have been condemned.</P><P>Consider the example of David. Although David was victorious and was a good king, he was not perfect according to the law. He committed fornication, conspired to kill one of his soldiers, and robbed that soldier of his wife. The genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 says, "David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah" (v. 6). The expression her who had been the wife of Uriah is not pleasant, for it emphasizes David's great sin and shows that there is this black spot in the genealogy of Christ. David surely was not perfect according to the law, but he was perfect according to the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the offerings. After he confessed his sins of murder and fornication, he applied the offering (Psa. 51:19), and through the offering he was forgiven. Actually, David was forgiven through Christ as the tabernacle, the priest, and the offerings.</P><P>The tabernacle signifies Christ as the embodiment of the merciful and gracious God. John 1:14 says, "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality." This verse does not say that the Word, which is Christ, became flesh, full of righteousness and justice. If Christ had been full only of righteousness and justice, we all would be condemned by God. But Christ as the tabernacle was full of grace, and as such a tabernacle He brought God to us. Then He died for our sins. In His death on the cross, He was the Priest and also the offerings. Therefore, through Christ as the tabernacle, the Priest, and the offerings, we sinners have been redeemed, saved, and regenerated. Furthermore, according to God's economy, we will also be renewed, sanctified, transformed, conformed to Christ's image, and glorified with Him in His glory.</P><P>The genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 is an extract of the entire Old Testament. This genealogy is an extract of the Old Testament not on the side of the law but on the side of the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the offerings. According to God's economy, it is thus the genealogy of the One who is the threefold seed, the One who is the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David. Christ was born of Mary, a descendant of David through his son Nathan. Mary's husband Joseph was a descendant of David through his son Solomon. Hence, they were both descendants of David, and through them Christ came.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Israel Entering into the Good Land</H2><P>In Joshua 3 and 4 Israel entered into the good land. That was something of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Israel Setting Up the Tabernacle<br>of the Ark in Shiloh</H2><P>Another aspect of the divine economy was Israel's setting up the tabernacle of the ark in Shiloh (Josh. 18:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Satanic Chaos with the Priests</H2><P>Again the satanic chaos followed the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Priests among Israel Being Degraded</H2><P>The priests among Israel became degraded and corrupt (1 Sam. 2:12-17, 22-34).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Ark Being Captured by Israel's Enemy</H2><P>In this chaotic situation, the ark, which was used in a superstitious way, was captured by Israel's enemy (1 Sam. 4:1&#151;5:2). The priests were killed, and the ark was captured.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Divine Economy<br>with David, Solomon, and the Positive Prophets</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Raising Up David<br>as a Man after His Own Heart to Do His Will</H2><P>In the divine economy, God raised up David as a man after His own heart to do His will (1 Sam. 13:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. David Bringing Back the Ark of God</H2><P>David brought back the ark of God (2 Sam. 6:1-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. David Desiring to Build the Temple for God<br>and Preparing the Material<br>and the Site for the Building of God's Temple</H2><P>David desired to build the temple for God and he prepared the material and the site for the building of God's temple (2 Sam. 7:2; 1 Chron. 22:1-19; 29:1-19; 2 Chron. 3:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Solomon Building the Temple for God<br>and Bringing the Ark into the Temple</H2><P>Solomon built the temple for God and brought the ark into the temple (1 Kings 5:4-5; 6:2; 7:51&#151;8:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Positive Prophets Ministering Faithfully</H2><P>The positive prophets ministered faithfully, especially concerning Christ in the divine economy. They prophesied a great deal concerning Christ in the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Satanic Chaos with the Kings,<br>the Priests, the Prophets, and the People</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. David Falling into Sin,<br>and His Family Becoming a Mess</H2><P>David fell into sin, and his family became a mess (2 Sam. 11&#151;18). This was an issue of David's sins of murder and fornication. As a result of David's sins, his family did not have peace. Absalom, one of his sons, killed another of the sons and then rebelled against David and even sought to kill him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Solomon Falling into Sin<br>and His Kingdom Being Divided into Two</H2><P>Solomon fell into sin, and his kingdom was divided into two (1 Kings 11:1-40).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Decline of the Kings, the Corruption<br>of the Priests, the Falsehood of the Prophets,<br>and the Evils of the People of Israel<br>Being Intolerable</H2><P>The decline of the kings, the corruption of the priests, the falsehood of the prophets, and the evils of the people of Israel were intolerable. This chaotic situation is recorded in 1 and 2 Kings and in the books of the prophets.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Jerusalem Being Destroyed,<br>the Temple Being Burned,<br>and the People of Israel Being Captured<br>by the Babylonians</H2><P>Eventually, Jerusalem was destroyed, the temple was burned, and the people of Israel were captured by the Babylonians (2 Chron. 36:17-20). What chaos! This chaotic situation still continues with Israel today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Divine Economy<br>with the Returned Captives</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Captives Returning to Their Fathers' Land</H2><P>After seventy years of captivity, the captives were released and returned to their fathers' land (Ezra 1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Temple of God with the Altar<br>for the Offerings Being Rebuilt</H2><P>The temple of God with the altar for the offerings (typifying Christ) was rebuilt (Ezra 3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Returned Remnant of David<br>Bringing Forth Christ as Their Messiah<br>in His First Coming</H2><P>The returned remnant of David brought forth Christ as their Messiah in His first coming (Matt. 1:1, 6b-16; Luke 3:22-31). Through Joseph and Mary, descendants of the returned captives, Christ was born.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Satanic Chaos with the Returned Captives</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Returned Captives Being Idle<br>in Building the Temple of God</H2><P>The returned captives were idle in building the temple of God (Hag. 1). They should have been excited and diligent to build the temple, but instead they became idle, forgetting the rebuilding of the temple.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Returned Captives Being<br>in a Messy Situation</H2><P>The returned captives were in a messy situation. This situation was dealt with in the books of Nehemiah, Haggai, and Malachi.</P><P>The Old Testament ends with chaos but not with disappointment. On the contrary, there was much expectation. The godly Jews were expecting to see the Messiah and looked forward to Messiah's coming. Thus, the Old Testament ends not only with chaos but with expectation&#151;the expectation of Christ's coming.</P><P>The coming of Christ is of two parts: the first coming and the second coming. Christ's first coming was the initiation of the New Testament economy, and Christ's second coming will be the consummation of the New Testament economy. The first coming is in the beginning of Matthew, and the second coming is in the end of Revelation. The church age, the time between these two comings, is actually the coming of Christ. The church is the process of Christ's coming. Christ is in the process of coming through all the church members, through the proper church life.</P><P>The entire New Testament is a matter of the coming of Christ, the wonderful One. In between the initiation of the New Testament economy and its consummation, there is the process of the church, and the church life is the process of Christ's coming. Christ is on the way of His coming, and the church life is the way on which Christ is coming. Christ has come to initiate the New Testament economy, and He is coming to consummate the New Testament economy. Now He is on the way of His coming, and this way is the church. Therefore, if we are in the church, we are in His coming.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DIVINE ECONOMY<br>AND THE SATANIC CHAOS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14;

the fourth one had the teaching of Jezebel involved with fornication, idolatry, and the deep things of Satan (2:20, 24a); the fifth one was living in name, yet she was dead, with nothing perfect before God (3:1-2); and the last one, in Laodicea, was lukewarm, boasting in her "riches," but not realizing her wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked condition, with the Lord Christ standing outside and knocking at her door (3:14-17, 20).</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>The ending of the satanic chaos and the consummation of the divine economy:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The satanic chaos will end with the termination of the evil Satan, the old creation, and all the negative things in the lake of fire&#151;Rev. 20:9&#151;21:1, 8;

These are the Adamic race, the race created by God, and the Abrahamic race, the race chosen by God. The first ten and a half chapters of Genesis are concerned with the Adamic race, the created race. This race failed God to the uttermost at Babel, where, in union with Satan to frustrate the divine economy, they rebelled against God, exalted themselves, and worshipped idols. Then God came in to select a person by the name of Abraham and decided to make his descendants a new race, the chosen race. The entire Bible from the second half of Genesis 11 to the end of the New Testament is occupied with this elect race.</P><P>With both the created race and the chosen race, God suffered a loss. The Adamic race failed Him, and the Abrahamic race also failed Him. As we read through the Old Testament to the end, we see that the children of Israel, the race of Abraham, utterly failed God. Nevertheless, the Old Testament ends not with disappointment but with expectation, for the godly ones among the chosen race were eagerly expecting the Messiah and were looking forward to receiving him. Thus, the Old Testament ends with the expectation that the Messiah, the unique one, would come.</P><P>Whereas the Old Testament ends with an expectation, the New Testament begins with a genealogy. Matthew 1:1 says, "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham." Verse 2 goes on to say that Abraham begot Isaac, that Isaac begot Jacob, and that Jacob begot Judah and his brothers. This genealogy continues until it arrives at a unique person: the One who in the Old Testament is called Messiah and in the New Testament is called Christ. Verse 17 concludes, "Thus all the generations...until the Christ." All the generations of the Abrahamic race were directed to Christ and brought in Christ. Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations; as such, He fulfills their prophecies, solves their problems, and meets their needs. When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him. From this point on, the whole New Testament is a full expounding of this wonderful Christ, who is everything to us. Hallelujah, Christ has come!</P><P>At the beginning of the New Testament, we have a new race with a new center, and this center is Christ. With Him we have the divine economy, the divine dispensing, and the unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8). When Christ comes, all manner of positive things come with Him. The list of these things is endless.</P><P>The list of what came with Christ even includes us who believe in Christ, for as believers we are descendants of Abraham. When God selected Abraham, He decided to give him two kinds of descendants&#151;the physical descendants and the spiritual descendants. Abraham's physical descendants are the physical Israel, and his spiritual descendants are the spiritual Israel. The New Testament deals mainly not with the physical Israel but with the spiritual Israel. In order that we may have full confidence concerning this, let us now consider some verses from the book of Galatians.</P><P>Galatians 3:8 says, "The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles out of faith, announced the gospel beforehand to Abraham: `In you shall all the nations be blessed.'" Here Paul does not say that God would justify the Jews; he says that God would justify the Gentiles. But then he tells us that the gospel was announced not to the Gentiles but to Abraham. God announced to Abraham the gospel concerning the Gentiles. This indicates that the Gentiles would be included among the spiritual descendants of Abraham.</P><P>Verse 9 continues, "So then they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham." Today we are of faith, and we are blessed with believing Abraham because we are his spiritual descendants.</P><P>In verses 13 and 14 Paul goes on to say, "Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, `Cursed is every one hanging on a tree'; in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith." What is the blessing that God promised to Abraham? It is the Spirit, the consummated Triune God. The consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit is the blessing of the gospel preached to us.</P><P>Now let us consider verses 27 through 29. These verses say, "As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are of Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise." Abraham has only one seed, Christ (v. 16). Hence, to be Abraham's seed we must be of Christ, be a part of Christ. Because we are one with Christ, we too are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God's promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. Thus, through faith we, the believers, are Abraham's seed. This means that our race has been changed from the Adamic race to the Abrahamic race. Now we, all the believers in Christ&#151;white, black, yellow, brown, and red&#151;are of the same race, the Abrahamic race.</P><P>We have a further confirmation of this in Galatians 6. Verse 10 says, "So then, as we have the opportunity, let us do what is good toward all, but especially toward those of the household of the faith." Who are those of the household of the faith? They are the spiritual descendants of Abraham, including all the believing Jews and believing Gentiles. No matter what our color may be, we all have faith, and we all are members of the household of the faith, members of the same family. All the believers in Christ together constitute a universal household, the great family of God.</P><P>Whereas in verse 10 we have the household of the faith, in verses 15 and 16 we have the new creation and the Israel of God. "Neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters. And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God." The household of the faith is the new creation, and the new creation is the Israel of God. This means that these three terms&#151;household of the faith, new creation, and Israel of God&#151;are synonyms. As real Jews, as Abraham's spiritual descendants, we are first the household of the faith. Second, we are a new creation. "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation" (2 Cor. 5:17a). Finally, we are the Israel of God. Everyone who believes in Christ is a member of the household of the faith, a new creation, and a part of the Israel of God. What a wonderful people we are in Christ!</P><P>On the one hand, we are a new creation; on the other hand, we are still troubled by chaos. Sometimes we may wonder why God does not simply eliminate the satanic chaos. The infinite, eternal God accomplished the miracle of becoming incarnated; He remained in Mary's womb for nine months, and then He was born to be the God-man. Since He could do such a miracle, why did He not destroy those who opposed Him when He was on earth? Not long after the Lord Jesus was born, Herod tried to kill Him. Why did God not immediately do away with Herod? Eventually, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Herodians conspired to kill Him. Why did God not remove all of them? In other words, why did God not rid the earth of chaos? In our opinion, God should come in to clear away all the satanic chaos. We may say to Him, "Lord, why is the chaos still here? Why do You not take it away? If You would eliminate the chaos, a lot of time would be saved, and there would be no more problems." Probably we all have had this kind of thought.</P><P>Today we still experience chaos in our family life. In the morning we may have a pleasant time with the Lord enjoying the divine economy. However, not long afterward we may be troubled by our spouse or by one of our children. Suddenly instead of economy there is chaos.</P><P>We have chaos not only in our family life but even in the church life. Some might say that the church life is a paradise. Yes, in a sense the church life may be a kind of paradise, but this does not mean that there will never be turmoil in the church. In the thirty years that the Lord's recovery has been in the United States, we have seen turmoil after turmoil, chaos after chaos. When there is turmoil in the church life, we may be bothered and ask, "Is this the church life? Is this the recovery? What is the difference between this and the denominations?" In order that we all may be comforted, I am burdened to point out the record in the Bible of the satanic chaos in the old creation and the divine economy for the new creation.</P><P>I also have been bothered by the turmoil, but one day the Lord showed me from the New Testament how much the Lord Jesus Himself was troubled by chaos. When He was a baby, Herod tried to kill Him. But the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, telling him to take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt (Matt. 2:13). Later Joseph was instructed in a dream to return to the land of Israel and to settle in the city of Nazareth (vv. 19-23). God did not clear away all the chaos.</P><P>Although God sent His recovery to this country, He has not removed the chaos. On the contrary, we have been troubled by chaos both from the outside and from the inside. Certain opposers on the outside wrote evil books to slander and defame us. Certain of those who were once on the inside have caused turmoil, saying falsely that, since 1984, the recovery has changed in nature. One person even went so far as to say that the training in Taipei should be dismantled. Others have accused me of no longer caring for life but only for numbers. These accusations were made by those who were formerly on the inside, including some who had been intimately related to me and who had been under my training for twenty-five years. Such accusations and the turmoil caused by them are surely something chaotic.</P><P>During the years I was with Brother Nee, there was chaos again and again. I observed that the chaos came in cycles. Every eight or ten years was a cycle. Since I was Brother Nee's helper, the chaos was directed not at me but at him. He was the "umbrella" upon which the "rain" would fall, and I was under him. After I was sent out of mainland China, to some extent I became the umbrella, and throughout the years the rain has been falling on me. However, I can testify that actually the chaos does not hurt us or damage us. On the contrary, the chaos helps the recovery. For this reason, even in the midst of the chaos, I am comforted, I praise the Lord, and I rejoice in Him.</P><P>The New Testament is full not only of the divine economy but also of the satanic chaos. Let us now consider the record in the New Testament concerning the divine economy and the satanic chaos. After this, we will see the ending of the satanic chaos and the consummation of the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Concerning Christ and His Ministry</H2><P>Concerning Christ and His ministry, the New Testament reveals that there were both the divine economy and the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Divine Economy<br>with Christ as the God-man</H2><P>The divine economy, the ministry of Christ, and the New Testament go together. If there were no divine economy, there would have been no ministry of Christ and no New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Christ as the Embodiment of the Triune God<br>Becoming Incarnated to Be a God-man</H2><P>In the divine economy Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God became incarnated to be a God-man (John 1:1, 14; Luke 1:26-38; Matt. 1:18-23). We all need to see this marvelous fact and praise the Lord for it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. John the Baptist Coming Out<br>to Testify concerning Christ</H2><P>John the Baptist came out to testify concerning Christ (Matt. 3:1-12; John 1:6-8, 15, 19-36). In relation to Christ, John was a helper.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Seekers of Messiah<br>Coming to Christ and Following Him</H2><P>We have pointed out that many of the godly people were expecting the coming of the Messiah. According to the New Testament, the seekers of Messiah came to Christ and followed Him (John 1:37-49; Matt. 4:17-24; John 3:1-15). This also was a matter pertaining to the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Christ Teaching the Kingdom,<br>Proclaiming the Gospel,<br>and Healing All Kinds of Diseases</H2><P>In His ministry Christ taught the kingdom, proclaimed the gospel, and healed all kinds of diseases, attracting a great crowd to follow Him (Matt. 4:23-25). This teaching, proclaiming, and healing were all aspects of the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Christ Revealing to His Followers<br>the Kingdom of the Heavens,<br>the Mysteries of the Kingdom of the Heavens,<br>Christ and the Church,<br>the Consummation of This Age<br>and the Second Coming of Christ,<br>and the Mystery of the Divine Trinity<br>in Union with the Believers of Christ</H2><P>To His followers Christ revealed many wonderful things. In Matthew 5&#151;7 He revealed the kingdom of the heavens; in Matthew 13, the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens; in Matthew 16:13-19, Christ and the church; in Matthew 24&#151;25, the consummation of this age and the second coming of Christ; and in John 14&#151;17, the mystery of the Divine Trinity in union with the believers of Christ. Thus, Christ enabled His followers to see many heavenly mysteries, even to see the mystery of the organic union of the believers with the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Satanic Chaos with the Romans,<br>the Jews, and the Followers of Christ</H2><P>All these wonderful things in the divine economy were accompanied by something evil, the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Herod Seeking to Kill Christ in His Babyhood</H2><P>According to Matthew 2:1-22 Herod sought to kill Christ in His babyhood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Pharisees Criticizing and Blaspheming Christ</H2><P>As Christ was carrying out His ministry in the divine economy, the Pharisees criticized and blasphemed Him (Matt. 9:10-13, 33-34; 12:22-35).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The People of Israel Rejecting Christ<br>and His Teaching</H2><P>The people of Israel rejected Christ and His teaching (Matt. 11:20-24; 13:53-58).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Pharisees and Sadducees Tempting Christ<br>and Instructing People with Teachings of Leaven</H2><P>The Pharisees and Sadducees tempted Christ and instructed people with teachings of leaven (Matt. 16:1-12). For this reason, He said to His disciples, "Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees" (v. 6), and eventually they understood that by leaven He meant the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees (v. 12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Satan Moving in Peter to Frustrate Christ<br>from Carrying Out His Crucifixion</H2><P>Satan moved in Peter to frustrate Christ from carrying out His crucifixion (Matt. 16:21-26). When the Lord Jesus revealed to His disciples that He would be crucified, Peter, showing his love for the Lord, "took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!" (v. 22). When Peter said this, the Lord Jesus turned and said to him, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men" (v. 23). Apparently Peter was being very loving toward the Lord; actually he was motivated by Satan. This means that even Peter's love for the Lord Jesus was instigated by Satan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. The Followers of Christ<br>Contending with One Another to Be Great</H2><P>The followers of Christ contended with one another to be great (Luke 22:24; Matt. 20:21-27). While the Lord Jesus was expecting soon to be crucified, His followers were fighting with one another about who would be first among them. They had heard many things about the heavenly kingdom, but instead of caring about those things, they cared about being great. Their contending with one another to be great must have been instigated by Satan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. One of Christ's Followers Betraying Christ,<br>Another Denying Him Three Times,<br>and the Rest, as Sheep, Being Scattered</H2><P>One of Christ's followers, Judas, betrayed Christ (Luke 22:21-23, 47-48). Another of His followers, Peter, denied Him three times under Satan's sifting (Luke 22:31-34, 54-62). Eventually, the rest, as sheep, were scattered (Matt. 26:31), and the Lord Jesus was left alone.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. The Jews Collaborating with the Roman Government<br>to Sentence Christ to Death and Crucify Him</H2><P>The Jews collaborated with the Roman government to sentence Christ to death and crucify Him (Luke 23:1-43). That certainly was something of the satanic chaos, but eventually the outcome of that chaos was something very good.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Divine Economy<br>in Christ's Crucifixion, Resurrection,<br>and Ascension</H2><P>Now we need to see the divine economy in Christ's crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. God Judging Christ on the Cross<br>for the Sin of the World<br>and for the Sin of the Believers,<br>and Christ Dying an All-inclusive Vicarious Death</H2><P>A great part of God's economy was Christ's death on the cross. God judged Christ on the cross for the sin of the world and for the sin of the believers (John 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:3). Christ died an all-inclusive vicarious death (John 19:34; 12:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Women Followers of Christ<br>Watching His Crucifixion</H2><P>The women followers of Christ watched His crucifixion (Matt. 27:55-56). This indicates that in loving the Lord Jesus the sisters are stronger than the brothers and are ahead of the brothers. Whereas Peter and the other disciples forsook the Lord, the women followed Him from Gethsemane and eventually watched His crucifixion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Joseph, One Expecting the Kingdom of God,<br>and the Women Followers of Christ<br>Burying Christ in an Excellent Way</H2><P>Joseph, one expecting the kingdom of God, had a high position in society and was a hidden disciple. He and the women followers of Christ buried Christ in an excellent way (Luke 23:50-56; Matt. 27:57-61). Christ was not born in an excellent way, and He did not die in an excellent way. However, His burial was excellent and according to the highest standard.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Followers of Christ Discovering His Resurrection<br>and Receiving the Revelation That Christ<br>in His Humanity Was Born in His Resurrection<br>to Be the Firstborn Son of God<br>with His Many Brothers Constituting the Body</H2><P>The followers of Christ discovered His resurrection and received the revelation that Christ in His humanity was born in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God with His many brothers constituting the Body (Matt. 28:1-10; John 20:1-18; Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:11-12). This discovery was made not by the brothers but by the sisters, and the revelation was given to them. Then the sisters brought the news to the brothers. The revelation was that the very Christ who was in the flesh was born in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God and that all His believers were born at that same time to be the many sons of God and the many brothers of Christ who constitute His Body, the church.</P><P>The resurrected Christ said to Mary, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" (John 20:17). Concerning the believers being Christ's brothers, Hebrews 2:11 says, "Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers." The next verse, a quotation of Psalm 22:22, goes on to say, "I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You." By declaring the Father's name to His brothers, the Lord Jesus made them the church. This is a great matter in the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Christ in His Resurrection<br>Teaching His Eleven Apostles<br>concerning the Kingdom of God<br>for Forty Days</H2><P>Acts 1:3 tells us that, as part of the divine economy, Christ in His resurrection taught His eleven apostles concerning the kingdom of God for forty days.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. The Disciples of Christ Seeing His Ascension</H2><P>According to Acts 1:9-11 the disciples of Christ saw His ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Satanic Chaos with the Chief Priests,<br>the Pharisees, and the Elders</H2><P>The resurrection of Christ was accompanied by the chaos with the chief priests, the Pharisees, and the elders. In this situation also, God did not remove the chaos but allowed it to remain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Chief Priests and Pharisees<br>Sending Soldiers to Guard<br>the Grave of Christ</H2><P>On the day after Christ's crucifixion, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate and asked him to give orders for the grave to be secured until the third day (Matt. 27:62-64). Pilate told them to take a guard and to make the tomb secure. Then they went and secured the grave, sealing the stone (vv. 65-66). Nevertheless, on the third day Christ came forth from the grave in resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Chief Priests and the Elders<br>Bribing the Guarding Soldiers to Say<br>That the Disciples of Jesus Stole His Body Away</H2><P>After the Lord Jesus was resurrected, the chief priests and the elders bribed the guarding soldiers to say that while they were sleeping in the night, the disciples of Jesus stole His body away (Matt. 28:11-15). This lie caused confusion. On the one hand, the disciples said that Christ was resurrected. On the other hand, the bribed soldiers said that Jesus' body had been stolen by His disciples. This caused the Jewish society to be confused. Whose word would the people believe&#151;the word of the disciples or the word of the soldiers? They, of course, believed the soldiers' word, and that annulled the news of Christ's resurrection. This surely was another aspect of the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In the Ministry of the Apostles</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Divine Economy</H2><P>The divine economy can also be seen in the ministry of the apostles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Peter and About One Hundred Twenty Disciples<br>Gathering Together and Praying<br>in One Accord for Ten Days</H2><P>Peter and about one hundred twenty disciples gathered together and prayed in one accord for ten days (Acts 1:12-15). That one accord was a wonderful thing. It is difficult for believers to pray in one accord even for an hour, much less for ten days. In Acts 1 the disciples were burdened to continue steadfastly with one accord in prayer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Spirit Being Poured Out<br>upon the One Hundred Twenty Disciples of Christ<br>on the Day of Pentecost</H2><P>The Spirit was poured out upon the one hundred twenty disciples of Christ on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4, 17-18). That was a great matter. The outpoured Spirit was actually the pneumatic Christ. The pneumatic Christ poured out Himself as the all-inclusive, compound, consummated Spirit upon His disciples so that they could be constituted and built up to be His Body, the organism of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Peter Preaching at Pentecost<br>and Three Thousand Repenting, Believing,<br>and Being Baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ</H2><P>Peter preached at Pentecost, and three thousand repented, believed, and were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:14-41). Then the church was established. Later the number of men came to about five thousand (4:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Believers Continuing Steadfastly<br>in the Teaching and the Fellowship of the Apostles,<br>in the Breaking of Bread and the Prayers,<br>Having All Possessions Common,<br>and Increasing with New Believers Day by Day</H2><P>The believers continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers (Acts 2:42). They had all possessions common and increased with new believers day by day (vv. 43-47; 4:32-37).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. The Word of God Growing<br>and the Number of the Disciples Multiplying Greatly</H2><P>According to the record in the book of Acts, the word of God grew, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly (6:7; 12:24; 19:20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. The Disciples Being Scattered<br>from Jerusalem to Preach the Gospel<br>throughout the Regions of Judea and Samaria</H2><P>The disciples were scattered from Jerusalem throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria. Those who were scattered went throughout the land preaching the gospel (Acts 8:1, 4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. The Gospel Spreading under Peter's Ministry</H2><P>In Acts 9:32-43 we see that the gospel spread under Peter's ministry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. The Gospel, through Paul's Ministry,<br>Spreading to the Gentile World,<br>and Many Churches Being Raised Up</H2><P>Through Paul's ministry the gospel spread to the Gentile world, and many churches were raised up (Acts 13&#151;28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>i. The Churches Raised Up through Paul's Ministry<br>Being Strengthened and Corrected<br>under John's Ministry</H2><P>The Epistles of 1, 2, and 3 John and the book of Revelation show us that the churches raised up through Paul's ministry were strengthened and corrected under John's ministry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Satanic Chaos</H2><P>Again the satanic chaos was unavoidable and went along with the divine economy in the ministry of the apostles. This chaos includes twenty-six items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Jewish Religion and the Roman Government<br>Persecuting the Apostles and the Church</H2><P>The Jewish religion and the Roman government persecuted the apostles and the church (Acts 4:1-3, 5-6; 7:57&#151;8:3; 12:1-4; 16:22-24). Religion and politics often collaborate to persecute and damage the Lord's interest on earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Ananias and Sapphira Deceiving the Spirit<br>and Being Punished to Death</H2><P>In Acts 5:1-11 Ananias, a brother, and his wife Sapphira deceived the Spirit and were punished to death in the presence of the church. That surely was something of chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Jews Rejecting the Apostles' Preaching<br>and Persecuting the Apostles</H2><P>The Jews rejected the apostles' preaching and persecuted the apostles (Acts 13:45-46, 50; 14:2, 5, 19; 17:13; 18:12-13; 19:9; 20:3; 21:27-36). The Jews pursued the apostles in order to persecute them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Judaizers Stressing<br>Circumcision among the Believers</H2><P>The Judaizers stressed circumcision among the believers (Acts 11:1-3; 15:1-2). That was something quite negative.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Peter and Barnabas Becoming Weak<br>in Keeping the Truth of the Gospel</H2><P>Peter and Barnabas became weak in keeping the truth of the gospel (Gal. 2:11-14). They became hypocritical and were rebuked by Paul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. Barnabas Separating Himself<br>and His Work from Paul</H2><P>In Acts 15:36-39 Barnabas separated himself and his work from Paul. That terminated Barnabas' glorious ministry. For this reason, in the remaining chapters of Acts, although there is a long record of the glorious activity of Paul, there is not a word of glory concerning the activity of Barnabas. He was out of the flow of the Spirit. Barnabas is mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament, but he is not mentioned with any record of glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. The Church in Corinth<br>Having Divisions, Fornication, and Lawsuits,<br>Questioning the Apostleship of Paul,<br>and Condemning Paul of Being Crafty,<br>Saying That He Took Advantage of Them by Guile</H2><P>The church in Corinth had divisions, fornication, and lawsuits (1 Cor. 1:10-13; 11:18-19; 5:1; 6:1, 6-8). They also questioned the apostleship of Paul (9:1-3) and even accused Paul of being crafty, saying that through Titus he took advantage of them by guile (2 Cor. 12:16-18). In principle, the situation is the same today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. The Jewish Preachers of the Gospel<br>Preaching the Gospel in Rivalry with Paul</H2><P>The Jewish preachers, the Judaizers, preached the gospel in rivalry with Paul (Phil. 1:15-17). From this we see that there can be rivalry even in the preaching of the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>i. The Judaizers, as Dogs, Evil Workers, the Concision,<br>and False Brothers, Stealing into the Churches</H2><P>Philippians 3:2 and Galatians 2:4 reveal that the Judaizers, as dogs, evil workers, the concision, and false brothers, stole into the churches to cause trouble.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>j. Gnostics Coming In<br>to Carry the Believers Off through Their Philosophy<br>according to the Tradition of Men<br>and the Elements of the World<br>and Not according to Christ</H2><P>Gnostics, people of Greek philosophy, came in to carry the believers off through their philosophy according to the tradition of men and the elements of the world and not according to Christ (Col. 2:8). The activity of the Gnostics caused much dissension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>k. The Teaching of Different Things<br>Other Than God's Economy in Faith Being Carried On</H2><P>The teaching of different things other than God's economy in faith was carried on (1 Tim. 1:3-4). Both at Paul's time and today, there were different teachings, teachings other than the divine economy taught by Paul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>l. The Winds of Teaching in the Sleight of Men,<br>in Craftiness, Invading the Churches</H2><P>The winds of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness, invaded the churches (Eph. 4:14). We know what the winds of teaching are, for we have seen them and experienced them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>m. Division-makers Rising Up</H2><P>In Romans 16:17 Paul says, "I exhort you, brothers, to mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them." This indicates that division-makers had risen up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>n. Factious (Sectarian) Men Existing in the Churches</H2><P>In Titus 3:10 Paul says, "A factious man, after a first and second admonition, refuse." This tells us that factious (sectarian) men existed in the churches. Such sectarian men cause divisions by forming parties in the church according to their own opinions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>o. The Two Sister Co-workers,<br>Euodias and Syntyche, Being in Discord</H2><P>The two sister co-workers, Euodias and Syntyche, were in discord (Phil. 4:2-3a). It is easy for sisters to be in discord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>p. James and the Elders in Jerusalem Exhorting Paul<br>to Keep the Ordinances of the Jewish Law</H2><P>James and the elders in Jerusalem exhorted Paul to keep the ordinances of the Jewish law (Acts 21:18-26). It is hard to believe that the leading elders in Jerusalem exhorted Paul to go back to the temple and, under the priests in Judaism, to keep the ordinance of their law. But this is what they did, and Paul followed their exhortation. However, the Lord did not allow Paul to complete the ceremony. On the last day of the ceremony, there was a turmoil, and Paul was put into prison. Eventually, Paul was transferred to a prison in Rome. He was released, but within a year he was arrested again and martyred.</P><P>What would you say about Paul's situation? Some might say that Paul made a mistake and was not faithful in his ministry, and that was the reason he was put into prison and was eventually brought to Rome to be judged directly by Caesar. No doubt, in Acts 21 there was great chaos. However, without this chaos we would not have the books of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus. Deep truths concerning the church life, the Christian life, and God's economy with the divine dispensing are in these books. If these books were not in the New Testament, there would be a great lack. While Paul was in prison, he wrote epistles that are filled with wonderful, high revelation. This indicates that the chaos eventually enabled something most excellent to be produced. Furthermore, Paul's martyrdom has been an encouragement to saints throughout the centuries. Thus, what the enemy did in that chaotic situation became a profit to God's interests.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>q. Some, as Hymenaeus and Alexander,<br>Thrusting Away Faith and a Good Conscience<br>and Becoming Shipwrecked regarding the faith</H2><P>Some, as Hymenaeus and Alexander, thrust away faith and a good conscience and became shipwrecked regarding the faith (1 Tim. 1:19-20; cf. 4:1-2). Hymenaeus and Alexander must have been leading ones, prominent ones in the churches, yet they had a very serious change.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>r. All the Believers in Asia<br>Turning Away from Paul's Ministry</H2><P>All the believers in Asia turned away from Paul's ministry. The word all in 2 Timothy 1:15 indicates what the situation was in a general way. It does not mean that everyone in Asia forsook Paul's ministry. Generally speaking, the saints and the churches in Asia forsook Paul's ministry. The New Testament indicates that this was the reason the churches in Asia became degraded.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>s. Some, as Hymenaeus and Philetus,<br>Misaiming concerning the Truth,<br>Saying That the Resurrection Had Already Taken Place</H2><P>Some, as Hymenaeus and Philetus, misaimed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection had already taken place (2 Tim. 2:17-18). To misaim here is to miss the mark, to swerve, to deviate. Saying that the resurrection had already taken place was a serious heresy that denied the divine power in life (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:16; Rev. 20:4, 6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>t. Demas Loving the Present Age<br>and Abandoning the Apostle Paul</H2><P>Demas, a co-worker of Paul, loved the present age and abandoned the apostle Paul (2 Tim. 4:10a). Today certain co-workers have left us. Even at Paul's time such a thing happened when Demas abandoned Paul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>u. Alexander the Coppersmith Doing<br>Many Evil Things to the Apostle Paul</H2><P>Alexander the coppersmith, an opposer and an attacker of the apostle Paul, did many evil things to him (2 Tim. 4:14-15). Alexander once might have been very close to Paul but later hated him and became his enemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>v. In Paul's First Defense<br>No One Being with Him to Support Him,<br>but All Abandoning Him</H2><P>In Paul's first defense no one was with him to support him, but all abandoned him, leaving him alone (2 Tim. 4:16-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>w. Some Going Beyond<br>and Not Abiding in the Teaching of Christ</H2><P>Some went beyond and did not abide in the teaching of Christ (2 John 9-11). This means that certain ones did not abide in the teaching concerning Christ's person and redemptive work. Such ones were heretics, and John told us to quarantine them and not to invite them into our homes or to greet them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>x. Diotrephes Loving to Be First in the Church<br>and Not Receiving the Apostles</H2><P>Diotrephes, who was very ambitious, loved to be first in the church and did not receive the apostles (3 John 9-10). This shows how serious the chaos had become.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>y. Some Going in the Way of Cain,<br>Rushing Out in the Error of Balaam for Reward,<br>and Perishing in the Rebellion of Korah</H2><P>Some went in the way of Cain, rushed out in the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the rebellion of Korah (Jude 11-13). The stories concerning Cain, Balaam, and Korah were repeated in the church life, and this repetition brought chaos into the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>z. The Situation of the First, Third, Fourth,<br>Fifth, and Seventh of the Seven Churches in Asia</H2><P>Among the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the first one lost her first love toward the Lord (2:4); the third one fell into the world where Satan's throne is, held the teaching of Balaam involved with idolatry and fornication, and held also the teaching of the Nicolaitans related to hierarchy (2:13-15); the fourth one had the teaching of Jezebel involved with fornication, idolatry, and the deep things of Satan (2:20, 24a); the fifth one was living in name, yet she was dead, with nothing perfect before God (3:1-2); and the last one, in Laodicea, was lukewarm, boasting in her "riches," but not realizing her wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked condition, with the Lord Christ standing outside and knocking at her door (3:14-17, 20).</P><P>Thus far in this message we have covered almost the entire New Testament regarding the divine economy and the satanic chaos. We have seen that the ministry both of the Lord Jesus and of the apostles was accompanied by chaos. No other apostle suffered as much as Paul did. He suffered persecution from the Jewish religion and also from the Roman government. Wherever he went chaos was waiting for him. The last time he went to Jerusalem was for the interest of the church there; he was deeply concerned about the Judaic situation in the church in Jerusalem. After he arrived, he followed the advice of James and the elders to offer sacrifices in the temple. We have pointed out that the Lord did not allow him to complete the ceremony. There was turmoil, and that caused Paul to be put into prison. Although that ended his traveling ministry, it did not end his writing ministry. On the contrary, his writing ministry became higher, deeper, and richer, and the epistles written from prison have been a great benefit to the believers throughout the centuries. Eventually the chaos that went along with Paul's ministry benefited the church.</P><P>The principle is the same with the recent turmoil among us in the Lord's recovery. This chaos has helped the recovery and has stabilized the recovery in this country. Through this turmoil many have been tested, stabilized, and established.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE ENDING OF THE SATANIC CHAOS<br>AND THE CONSUMMATION OF THE DIVINE ECONOMY</H2><P>Now I would like to give a concluding word regarding the ending of the satanic chaos and the consummation of the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Satanic Chaos Ending<br>with the Termination of the Evil Satan,<br>the Old Creation, and All the Negative Things<br>in the Lake of Fire</H2><P>The satanic chaos will end with the termination of the evil Satan, the old creation, and all the negative things in the lake of fire (Rev. 20:9&#151;21:1, 8; 22:15). The lake of fire will be the universal "trash can," and all the negative things, which have caused the chaos in both the Old Testament and in the New Testament, will be gathered there. The lake of fire, therefore, will be the ending of all the chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Divine Economy Being Consummated<br>with the Processed Triune God,<br>the New Creation, and<br>the Holy City of Living Water</H2><P>The divine economy will be consummated, not ended, with the processed Triune God, the new creation, and the holy city of living water (Rev. 21&#151;22). The holy city of living water is the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is a composition, a constitution, of the redeeming Triune God with His redeemed tripartite man. He will be our temple where we will worship and where we will have our dwelling, and we will be His tabernacle where He will dwell and where He will enjoy us as His satisfaction. Hence, the New Jerusalem will be a place of mutual dwelling and mutual satisfaction for eternity. I hope that we will all be comforted by this revelation concerning the end of the satanic chaos and the consummation of the divine economy.</P><P>We have emphasized the fact that the satanic chaos is in the old creation and that the divine economy is for the new creation. The divine economy is to produce the new creation out of the chaotic old creation. This producing of the new creation will continue until the end of the millennium (Rev. 20). That will be the time for the new heaven and the new earth to appear with the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem, the holy city, will be the consummation of the divine economy.</P><P>The New Jerusalem will be the enlargement and consummation of today's church life. We praise the Lord that we are in the church. In the church life we experience the divine economy with the help of the satanic chaos. The satanic chaos helps our Christian life and also our church life.</P><P>In the Old Testament, which ends with the expectation of Christ's coming, Christ is prophesied and promised. He was the expectation of God's chosen people. In the New Testament Christ has come, and He is coming. Christ's first coming, or the first part of Christ's coming, initiated the New Testament economy. His second coming, or the second part of His coming, will consummate the New Testament economy. Between the initiation and the consummation, there is the long period of the church life. The church life is also a part of Christ's coming. Christ has come, yet His coming is still taking place in the church life. The process of the church life is the process of Christ's coming.</P><P>Today we are experiencing the church life, which is the process of Christ's coming. Every time a sinner is baptized, that is a further step of Christ's coming. Likewise, our growth in life is the advancement, the furthering, of His coming. The more we advance, the sooner Christ will come. If we want to hasten Christ's coming, we need to advance more quickly.</P><P>As we are in the church life as the process of Christ's coming, we should not be troubled by any kind of chaos. We should not be bothered or disappointed by chaos, because chaos actually helps us. Every kind of chaos is a help to God's chosen people and to Christ's Body, the organism of the Triune God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE OVERCOMERS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Not disappointed or discouraged but strengthened and enabled to stand for and live out the divine economy.</li><li>To conquer all the satanic chaos and carry out the unique divine economy:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>By the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-sufficient grace&#151;1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 12:9; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li>	<li>According to the truth, of which the church, the manifestation of God in the flesh, is the pillar and base&#151;1 Tim. 3:15-16.</li>	<li>In the following conditions:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Loving the Lord with the first love&#151;Rev. 2:4.</li>		<li>Enjoying eating Christ as the tree of life in the church as today's Paradise to be a shining lampstand --Rev. 2:7, 5.</li>		<li>Being faithful unto death in suffering poverty and trial for the crown of life&#151;Rev. 2:9-10.</li>		<li>Enjoying Christ as the hidden manna, a special portion of the nourishing supply, to overcome the worldliness of the degraded church with the idolatrous teaching of Balaam and the hierarchical teaching of the Nicolaitans --Rev. 2:12-17a.</li>		<li>Being transformed to be a "white stone," justified and approved by the Lord, for the building up of the house of God, with a "new name" according to the transformation in life&#151;Rev. 2:17b.</li>		<li>Standing strongly against the Romish teaching of Jezebel, which is full of fornication, idolatry, and the deep things of Satan&#151;Rev. 2:20, 24a.</li>		<li>Fleeing the spiritual death, being living in reality with nothing dying in imperfection, and walking in "white garments" without any defilement, that their name should not be erased out of the book of life but confessed by the Lord before His Father and His Father's angels&#151;Rev. 3:1-2, 4-5.</li>		<li>Keeping the Lord's word of endurance and not denying the Lord's name unto the last bit of their power, that they may be kept out of the hour of trial, which is coming to try all those who dwell on the earth, and that they may receive the crown of reward to be pillars in the temple of God with the name of God, the name of the city of God, the New Jerusalem, and Christ's new name written upon them&#151;Rev. 3:8b, 10-12.</li>		<li>Being hot, instead of being lukewarm, to buy gold refined by fire, white garments, and eyesalve that they may not be spewed out of the Lord's mouth, but may be invited to dine with the Lord and to sit with Him on His throne&#151;Rev. 3:15-21.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><P>In the two previous chapters we saw the divine economy and the satanic chaos in the Old and New Testaments. In this chapter we want to see a particular group of persons&#151;the overcomers. The Bible is a book concerning God with man. In between God and man there is a third party, Satan. Satan always makes trouble, and all the trouble is the chaos. The Lord needs a group of people, the overcomers, who will be one with Him to conquer all the destructive chaos and triumph in His unique constructive economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ADAMIC RACE,<br>THE ABRAHAMIC RACE ACCORDING TO THE FLESH,<br>THE ABRAHAMIC RACE ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT, AND THE OVERCOMING RACE</H2><P>In the first ten and a half chapters of Genesis, God was dealing with man as the Adamic race. But after these chapters of the Bible, God shifted to another group of people. This second group of people is composed of the descendants of one father, Abraham. God shifted from the Adamic race to the Abrahamic race. God's dealing with the Abrahamic race occupies nearly the entire Old Testament, from partway through Genesis 11 to the end of Malachi. The Old Testament covers the race of Adam and the physical descendants of Abraham. Both were a failure to God, but God could never be disappointed. He is the almighty One and the faithful One. He has the capacity to fulfill His faithfulness to keep His economy.</P><P>In the New Testament economy, God had a serious, vital shift to another group of people. He shifted from Abraham's descendants according to the flesh to Abraham's descendants according to the Spirit. The book of Genesis tells us that Abraham had two kinds of descendants, who were likened to the dust of the earth (13:16) and the stars of heaven (15:5). His earthly descendants are as the dust of the earth, and we, the New Testament believers as His heavenly descendants, are as the stars of heaven. The Jews by their natural birth all belong to the physical descendants of Abraham. Then all the believers in Christ, regardless of their race, are the spiritual descendants of Abraham (Gal. 3:7, 29). Regretfully, however, most of the spiritual descendants of Abraham also fail God. Then to whom can God go in order to carry out His purpose?</P><P>At the beginning of the last book of the Bible, the Lord Jesus as the High Priest walking among the golden lampstands gives a call to another group of people, the overcomers. In Revelation 2 and 3, He says "to him who overcomes" seven times (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). This is a sevenfold call to us, His believers, the spiritual descendants of our great father, Abraham. Christ calls out seven times for the overcomers.</P><P>The overcomers are the fourth race. The first race was Adamic, the second race was Abrahamic according to the flesh, and the third race was still Abrahamic, but according to the Spirit. However, even the spiritual Abrahamic race becomes a failure. Humanly speaking, it is quite disappointing, but divinely speaking, our God can never be shaken or disappointed. He is God! Regardless of what happens, He is still standing. Not only is He standing, but also He is the One who sat enthroned at the flood and who sits as King forever (Psa. 29:10). Because He is such a One, He produces another race, the top race, the super race, the race above all the races. This last race is the overcoming race!</P><P>From the time of Adam to the time of Abraham was exactly two thousand years. After the first two thousand years of human history, God shifted from the race of Adam to the race of Abraham. From the time of Abraham to the time of Christ was another two thousand years. Now we are here in the New Testament. The New Testament age is approaching two thousand years of history. Thus, there have been two thousand years for the Adamic race, two thousand years for the Abrahamic race according to the flesh, and almost two thousand years for the Abrahamic race according to the Spirit. What the Lord needs is the race of overcomers to conquer all the satanic chaos and triumph in the divine economy.</P><P>The book of Revelation is a book on the overcomers. The overcoming race in this book begins from Revelation 4 and continues through Revelation 22. The overcoming race brings in the success to God for His economy. We need to consider where we are today. Are we in Genesis 1&#151;10 in the Adamic race, in the remainder of the Old Testament in the Abrahamic race according to the flesh, or in the New Testament, from Matthew to Revelation 3, in the Abrahamic race according to the Spirit? We may say that we are in the New Testament, but this in itself is not adequate. We must be in the last nineteen chapters of the Bible, from Revelation 4 through 22, from the throne to the New Jerusalem.</P><P>We need to be those who belong to the overcoming race. If someone were to ask us what kind of people we are, we should be able to say, "I belong to a race of which you do not know. I belong to the race of the overcomers." According to God's economy, there are only four races on this earth&#151;the race of Adam, the race of Abraham according to the flesh, the race of Abraham according to the Spirit, and the race of the overcomers. We should declare by faith that we belong to the race of the overcomers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AN OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK OF REVELATION</H2><P>Now I would like to present an overview of the twenty-two chapters of the book of Revelation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ as the High Priest<br>Walking among the Golden Lampstands</H2><P>The first chapter reveals seven golden, shining, pure lampstands. Christ our Savior as the High Priest in His long priestly robe is walking among the lampstands to trim them in order to make them shine brighter (vv. 9-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Condition<br>of the Seven Churches on the Earth</H2><P>Chapters two and three portray the practical condition of the seven churches on the earth. The lampstands were bright, shining, of pure gold, and in the heavens, but on the earth their practical situation as the local churches was full of degradation.</P><P>The first church, Ephesus, left her first love for the Lord (2:4). The enjoyment of the Lord as the tree of life seemingly stopped, and the lampstand was close to being removed (vv. 5, 7).</P><P>The second church, Smyrna, was very good, but the persecution the saints suffered under the earthly empire was severe. Many of them were martyred. The Lord told them that they would have tribulation for "ten days" under the Roman Empire's persecution (v. 10). The number ten signifies fullness. Ten days indicates prophetically the ten periods of persecution that the church suffered under the Roman emperors, beginning with Caesar Nero in the second half of the first century and ending with Constantine the Great in the first part of the fourth century. The Lord had no rebuke for the suffering church. He encouraged them to be faithful unto death so that He could give them the crown of life. With the second church, there was not chaos from within but from without. The earthly government persecuted the second church to the uttermost.</P><P>The third church, Pergamos, became a worldly church, a church married to a husband whose name is the world. This was fulfilled at Constantine's time. Satan failed to destroy the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire in the first three centuries, so he changed his strategy. He sought instead to corrupt the church through Constantine's welcoming of Christianity as the state religion in the first part of the fourth century. Through Constantine's encouragement and political influence the church was married to the Roman Empire, that is, to the world. Since the church entered into union with the world, she dwelt where Satan's throne is (v. 13). Satan as the ruler of this world (John 12:31) has his throne in the world, and the church became one with the world. With the worldly church, different teachings came in such as the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans (Rev. 2:14-15). The worldly church lost the enjoyment of Christ in a hidden way as the hidden manna (v. 17). Thus, this church was filled with the satanic chaos and was under the rebuking of Christ.</P><P>The church eventually degraded further from being worldly to being Roman, as shown by the church in Thyatira (v. 18). The Roman Catholic Church with the teaching of Jezebel (v. 20) was fully formed as the apostate church by the establishment of the universal papal system in the latter part of the sixth century. The Roman Catholic Church is typified by the woman Jezebel, a self-appointed prophetess who presumed to be authorized by God to speak for God. The Bible, however, forbids any woman to teach with authority. The entire Roman Catholic Church as a female claims that it has the authority to teach. Those in Roman Catholicism follow what the pope says, what the church says, not what the Bible says, what the Lord says. The pope representing the church, not the holy Word and not God Himself, is the highest authority. Not only is the corruption of the devil present in the Catholic Church, but also the deep things of Satan, the satanic deep mysteries, are being taught (v. 24). What chaos there is in this church in apostasy!</P><P>The fifth church is the church in Sardis. The Lord told those in the church in Sardis that they had a name that they were living, yet they were dead (3:1). Everything related to this church was either dead or dying, and their works were not completed before God (v. 2). This describes the church in the Reformation. The reformed Protestant churches were very good as a reaction to the degradation of Catholicism, but eventually in the eyes of God, they were dead. Death implies weakness to the uttermost. The Protestant denominations are either dying or dead. According to Revelation 2 and 3, the Catholic Church is devilish, satanic, and heretical, and the Protestant churches are dying and dead. It is a statistical fact that many of the main line denominations are having very little increase and are even losing their members.</P><P>The sixth church is the church in Philadelphia (v. 7). Those in Philadelphia kept the word of the Lord, which is the word of His endurance (vv. 8, 10). The word of the Lord's endurance is the word of the Lord's suffering. To keep the word of His endurance, we must bear His rejection and persecution. Those in Philadelphia knew the Bible, the Word of God, and they kept it with all endurance. Furthermore, they did not deny the name of Christ (v. 8). The reformed Protestant Church denied the Lord's name by denominating herself, taking many other names, such as Lutheran, Wesleyan, Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc. The recovered church takes no name other than her Husband's. Christ appreciated and highly appraised the church in Philadelphia. There was no chaos with this church.</P><P>However, yesterday's Philadelphia has become today's Laodicea. The main characteristic of Laodicea is lukewarmness (v. 16). Those in Laodicea may love the Lord, but not absolutely. The Lord told them that because they were lukewarm, He was about to spew them out of His mouth. They boasted that they were rich in knowing the truth, but they did not know their real situation. They did not realize that they were wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. The Lord also told them that He was standing outside the degraded church, knocking at her door (v. 20). Whoever would open the door, the Lord would go in to feast with him, and this one will eventually sit with the Lord on His throne in the kingdom age.</P><P>By looking at the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, we can see the chaos in the practical situation of today's church. Thus, we see the heavenly vision of Christ in the midst of the golden lampstands in Revelation 1 and the earthly practicality of the local churches in chapters two and three.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Opening of the Seven Seals&#151;<br>the Mystery of God's Economy</H2><P>Revelation 4 shows us the scene around the throne in the heavens. Regardless of what is happening on the earth, this does not affect God. He is above the earth, in the heavens, and still on the throne. The scroll with the seven seals was in the hand of the One sitting on the throne (5:1). These seven seals are the seven secrets of the universe, which are the mystery of God's economy. The Lamb, Christ, was worthy to take the scroll from the One on the throne and open its seals (vv. 7, 9).</P><P>Christ has opened the first four seals, which consist of four horses with their riders (6:1-8). The first horse signifies the gospel, the second horse signifies war, the third horse signifies famine, and the fourth horse signifies death. Since the time Christ ascended to the heavens and began to open the seven seals, the mystery of God's economy, these four horses have been running on this earth. The preaching of the gospel, war, famine, and death have been running on this earth for close to two thousand years. Since Christ's ascension, wars have increased. These wars have caused the shortage of food, and war with the shortage of food have issued in disease and death.</P><P>When Christ opened the fifth seal, John saw a group of martyrs under the altar, that is, underneath the earth (v. 9). These martyrs cried out, "How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?" (v. 10). The Lord told these martyrs to "rest yet a little while, until also the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed, even as they were, is completed" (v. 11). The cry of the martyred saints must occur near the end of this age. The fellow slaves and brothers who are about to be killed will be the martyrdom during the great tribulation (20:4).</P><P>The sixth seal, which marks the beginning of supernatural calamities, is God's answer to the cry of the martyred saints in the fifth seal and is a warning to those who dwell on the earth (6:12-17). The seventh seal includes many negative and positive things. The seventh seal, the entire contents of the seven trumpets (8:1-2), includes the supernatural calamities of the first four trumpets (vv. 7-12). The seventh seal also includes the three woes of the last three trumpets (8:13&#151;9:21; 11:14-15a, 18, 19b).</P><P>In the seventh trumpet of the seventh seal there will be the war at Armageddon where Antichrist with all his armies will be defeated (16:13-16; 19:11-21). Antichrist and the false prophet will then be thrown alive into the lake of fire (19:20). The seventh trumpet also includes the destruction of the great Babylon in Revelation 17 and 18. Religious Babylon is dealt with in chapter seventeen, and political Babylon is dealt with in chapter eighteen. Religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church, will be destroyed by Antichrist at the beginning of the great tribulation because of his opposition to any kind of religion (14:8; 17:16). The material Babylon, the city of Rome, will be fallen, destroyed by God (16:19), at the end of the great tribulation (18:2).</P><P>Revelation 19 tells us that after the destruction of religious and material Babylon, there will be the wedding day of the Lamb and the overcomers. The overcoming race eventually becomes a collective bride to Christ, the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9). I hope that we all will be a part of this collective bride. Revelation 19 also tells us that the overcoming Christ will come down from the heavens to the earth with His armies (vv. 11-14). The overcoming race, the newly married bride, will be the overcoming armies of the Bridegroom. Both the Bridegroom and His bride will come to Armageddon to defeat Antichrist with his armies. This will be Christ's treading of the great winepress where He destroys all the Gentile evil worldly forces (vv. 15-21).</P><P>After the destruction of Antichrist, Satan will be bound and imprisoned in the abyss by an angel for one thousand years (20:1-3). For one thousand years, the earth will be rid of Satan, and Christ will have the earth as His kingdom (vv. 4-6). At the end of the millennium, some of the nations will revolt against Christ, but fire will come down out of heaven to devour these rebellious ones (vv. 8-9). After the thousand years, the devil will be thrown into the lake of fire (v. 10).</P><P>Then the great white throne will be set up to judge the unbelieving dead and the demons (vv. 11-15). Along with death and Hades, they will be cast into the lake of fire. This will clear up the entire universe. The old heaven and the old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed to become the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 3:10-13), into which the New Jerusalem will come to be God's eternal expression.</P><P>We do not want to be defeated Christians. We want to cooperate with our God to be the overcomers in this age so that He can accomplish His purpose. Our eternal God can never be defeated. He is never disappointed. Eventually, He will have the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom with the overcomers, and afterward, in the new heaven and new earth, He will have an enlarged New Jerusalem, which includes all the saved ones who will have been perfected in the millennial kingdom. We will then be God's tabernacle for God to lodge in and enjoy us (Rev. 21:3), and God will be the temple for us to lodge in and enjoy Him (21:22). This is the mutual enjoyment and mutual lodging between the redeeming Triune God and His redeemed tripartite people for eternity. This consummates the entire New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH LIFE BEING<br>THE THRESHOLD OF THE KINGDOM</H2><P>Now that we have received an overview of the book of Revelation, we need to consider where we are and who we are. Thank the Lord that today we are in the church life. The church life is the threshold of the kingdom. As long as we are living in the church life, we are ready to take one more step to cross the threshold into the kingdom, the New Jerusalem, which is called the Paradise of God (Rev. 2:7). In the Paradise of God, we can enjoy the tree of life for one thousand years. After the thousand-year kingdom, we will be in the new heaven and the new earth as the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem in eternity includes the overcomers and all the dear saints whom God perfected during the thousand-year kingdom. I hope that all of us will be included in the race of overcomers, who will consummate God's economy. We all need to be the triumphant ones in God's unique constructive economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FIVE GROUPS OF OVERCOMERS<br>IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION</H2><P>We have seen that the first sixty-five books of the Bible are on the Adamic race, the Abrahamic race physically, and the Abrahamic race spiritually. In all the ages, these races suffered a defeat. God could not get through with them to finish His eternal economy. Thus, in the sixty-sixth book, the last book of the Bible, the Lord calls overcomers. It is the final race, the race of overcomers, who will accomplish and consummate God's eternal economy.</P><P>Revelation shows us the overcomers in five groups. The first group is in Revelation 6:9-11 where we see the martyrs who are under the altar. They are underneath the earth in Paradise, crying out, at the fifth seal near the end of this age, for the Lord to avenge them. They are both the martyrs of the Old Testament, such as Abel, the first martyr (Gen. 4:2-8), Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others (Matt. 23:34-36), and the martyrs of the New Testament up to the time before the great tribulation.</P><P>The second group of overcomers is the man-child in Revelation 12:5. The man-child born of the universal woman is composed of the overcoming saints who have died and been resurrected before the three and a half years of the great tribulation (vv. 6, 14). These who constitute the man-child should include those martyrs who cried to the Lord at the fifth seal. They do not love their soul-life even unto death (v. 11). Unto death indicates martyrdom.</P><P>The third group of overcomers is the hundred and forty-four thousand living overcomers, the firstfruits, in Revelation 14:1-5. The living overcomers will be raptured to the heavenly Mount Zion before the great tribulation.</P><P>Those who are standing on the glassy sea in Revelation 15:2-4 are the fourth group of overcomers. These overcomers are the martyrs who will be killed in the time of the great tribulation under the persecution of Antichrist and will be resurrected and raptured before the close of the great tribulation.</P><P>These four groups of overcomers constitute the fifth group, which is the prepared bride in Revelation 19:7-9. The bride is a composition of all the overcomers, who, except those who will stand on the glassy sea, will be raptured to the third heaven before the three and a half years of the great tribulation. The man-child will be raptured to the throne of God in the third heaven (Rev. 12:5), and the hundred and forty-four thousand living overcomers will be raptured to stand on heavenly Mount Zion in the third heaven (14:1). Then the Lord Jesus will come down with them to the air near the end of the great tribulation. In the air the Lord will rapture the majority of the saints (14:14-16), and all the believers will stand before the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). The mature believers will be the Lord's bride for His wedding. The immature ones will enter into a place for discipline, which the Bible refers to as outer darkness (Matt. 25:30). Through this discipline, they will be matured. While they are in outer darkness, the Lord will have the marriage feast with His overcoming believers.</P><P>The marriage dinner of the Lamb as the wedding feast will be a reward to the overcoming believers. After the marriage dinner, Christ will come as a fighting General with His bride as His army to fight against and defeat Antichrist and the kings under him with their armies at Armageddon (Rev. 19:11-21). Satan will then be bound and cast into the abyss for a thousand years (20:1-3). The defeat of Antichrist will end human government on earth, and Christ with His overcomers as co-kings will reign in His kingdom to rule over all the nations on earth for one thousand years (vv. 4-6). After these thousand years are completed, the old heaven and old earth will pass away and be renewed to become the new heaven and new earth. The New Jerusalem, composed of all of God's chosen and redeemed people throughout all generations, will then come down out of heaven to the new earth (21:2).</P><P>The book of Revelation shows us that without the overcomers Christ has no way to come back. We know that Christ is our way (John 14:6a). But from deep within His heart, Christ would tell us that the overcomers are His way. Without Christ, we do not have a way, but today without the overcomers, Christ has no way. The overcomers are the very way for Christ to come back.</P><P>Christ's coming is actually a long process. This coming was initiated with His first coming and will be consummated at His second coming. In between these two comings is the process of His coming. He is still on the way of His coming, and this way is the church, His Body, as represented by the overcomers. His second coming will be consummated through the overcomers. His Body in this age is partly overcoming and partly defeated. The defeated part is always under the satanic chaos. That part cannot be the process of Christ's coming. The overcoming part is the process of His coming. Revelation is a book on the overcomers who consummate God's economy. Without the overcomers, there is no way for God to accomplish His economy.</P><P>The title of this book is The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation. The new creation came into being through the divine economy, and the divine economy will be consummated by the overcomers. The overcoming martyrs who are under the altar began with Abel, the first martyr. Eventually, it will take God, beginning from the time of Adam, at least six thousand years to gain His bride, who is the aggregate of all the overcomers. The bride is the New Jerusalem, the Paradise of God, in the thousand-year kingdom. In those thousand years, God will discipline all those who have believed in the Lord Jesus but have been defeated and are not matured. Through this discipline for one thousand years, all of them will become mature, and they will be ready to become the constituents of the New Jerusalem in eternity.</P><P>In the thousand-year kingdom, the New Jerusalem is in the heavens, but after all of God's redeemed people become matured to be a part of the New Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven from God to the earth (Rev. 21:2). This indicates that our dwelling place for eternity will not be heaven but the New Jerusalem on the new earth. That will be the consummated and enlarged New Jerusalem as the wife of the Lamb for eternity. We all need to see that we need to be matured to become the New Jerusalem. If we are not matured in this age, God has a way to make us mature in the next age, but that way to be matured is the hard way.</P><P>It is correct to say that Revelation is a book on prophecy, but that is not the central purpose of this book. The central purpose of the book of Revelation is concerning the overcomers. God did not accomplish His economy with the race of Adam, with the race of Abraham according to the flesh, or with the race of Abraham according to the Spirit. But out of these three races, God gained some overcomers. Hebrews 11 lists a number of these overcomers from the Adamic race and from the Abrahamic race according to the flesh. From among the race of Adam and from the earthly descendants of Abraham, God did gain some overcomers such as Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, etc. I hope that we also will be counted among the overcomers.</P><P>The churches in the Lord's recovery, however, should not be reckoned as churches of overcomers. We should not think that everyone who is in the churches in the recovery is an overcomer. But our being in the churches in the recovery will strengthen us and help us to be matured to be an overcomer. The recovery is the Lord's way to help us to be the overcomers.</P><P>We have to run the race and finish the course so that we can be counted among the overcomers. Paul did not have the assurance that he had finished the course until right before his martyrdom. In 2 Timothy 4:6-8 Paul said, "For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness..." At that time Paul anticipated his reward in the coming kingdom. In order to be the overcomers, we must conquer all the destructive chaos and triumph in the unique constructive economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. NOT DISAPPOINTED OR DISCOURAGED<br>BUT STRENGTHENED AND ENABLED TO STAND FOR<br>AND LIVE OUT THE DIVINE ECONOMY</H2><P>The overcomers are those who suffer the chaos, but they are not disappointed or discouraged. Instead, they are strengthened and enabled to stand for and live out the divine economy. The satanic chaos is still going on around us in Christendom. Even within the Lord's recovery, we have experienced this chaos. Beginning in 1987 some among us rebelled against the recovery. Because of this rebellion, there are some divisions existing in the United States. All of us have to conquer this destructive chaos. If we are enabled by the Lord to conquer all the destructive chaos, we will triumphantly enter into the kingdom. We will be those who triumph in the unique constructive economy.</P><P>Romans 16:17 says that we need to mark those who make divisions and turn away from them. To turn away from those who make divisions is to conquer the destructive chaos. This preserves the oneness of the Body of Christ that we may have a normal church life. Those who make divisions like to contact the saints, and this contact causes the saints to be stumbled and leave the church life. If we open to these ones to listen to their divisive talk, we might be poisoned. This poison will cause us to doubt about the recovery and will weaken our morale for the recovery. We will be cold about attending the church meetings and about reading the Recovery Version with the Life-study Messages. If we contact and open to these dissenting ones, we will be cooled down. At the very least, they will make us lukewarm. In the Life-study of Second Timothy, we pointed out that the subject of this book is the inoculation against the decline of the church. We need such an inoculation to preserve us against the germs of the satanic chaos of rebellion and division.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TO CONQUER ALL THE SATANIC CHAOS<br>AND CARRY OUT THE UNIQUE DIVINE ECONOMY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By the Processed and Consummated<br>Triune God as the All-sufficient Grace</H2><P>We have to conquer the satanic chaos by the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-sufficient grace (1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 12:9; 2 Tim. 4:22). In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said that the grace of the Lord was with him; in Galatians 6:18 he said that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is with our spirit; and in 2 Timothy 4:22 he said that the Lord is with our spirit. The Lord as the all-sufficient grace is with our spirit, and we can conquer all the satanic chaos and carry out the unique divine economy by Him as our all-sufficient grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. According to the Truth, of Which the Church,<br>the Manifestation of God in the Flesh,<br>Is the Pillar and Base</H2><P>We can conquer all the satanic chaos and carry out the divine economy according to the truth, of which the church, the manifestation of God in the flesh, is the pillar and base (1 Tim. 3:15-16). The rebellious ones cannot shake the church in the Lord's recovery, because the church is the pillar and base of the truth. The pillar supports the building, and the base holds the pillar. The church is the pillar supporting the truth, and the base holding the truth. Because the church is the pillar and base of the truth, we need to be those who teach the truth. Our teaching of the truth will enlighten the darkened people, inoculate against the poison, swallow up the death, and bring the distracted back to the proper track.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In the Following Conditions</H2><P>Revelation 2 and 3 reveal that we need to conquer all the satanic chaos and carry out the unique divine economy in certain conditions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Loving the Lord with the First Love</H2><P>We need to be those who love the Lord with the first love (Rev. 2:4). The first love may be compared to the love of newlyweds. After a couple has been married for a period of time, it is easy for the first love to fade away. What wife loves her husband now as much as she did on her wedding day? We must recover the wedding, bridal love toward our Husband, Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Enjoying Eating Christ as the Tree of Life<br>in the Church as Today's Paradise<br>to Be a Shining Lampstand</H2><P>We also need to enjoy eating Christ as the tree of life in the church as today's Paradise so that we can be a shining lampstand (Rev. 2:7, 5). The Lord does not say that He will give the overcomers to eat of the fruit of the tree of life. He tells the overcomers that He will give them to eat of the entire tree of life, which is Christ Himself. We should eat one tree, the universal tree, the unique tree, that is, the tree of life, which is Christ as the embodiment of the divine life.</P><P>We have to love the Lord with a bridal love, and we have to enjoy Him as the entire tree of life. This tree is growing in the Paradise of God. The Paradise of God (v. 7) is the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom. The New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom will be a paradise to God. This paradise will be much more pleasant than the garden of Eden. Today the church life is the precursor of this coming paradise, the miniature of the New Jerusalem in the coming kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Being Faithful unto Death<br>in Suffering Poverty and Trial<br>for the Crown of Life</H2><P>The Lord exhorted the church in Smyrna to be faithful unto death in suffering poverty and trial for the crown of life (Rev. 2:9-10). A crown in New Testament usage always denotes a prize that is in addition to salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Enjoying Christ as the Hidden Manna<br>to Overcome the Worldliness<br>of the Degraded Church</H2><P>We have to enjoy Christ as the hidden manna, a special portion of the nourishing supply, to overcome the worldliness of the degraded church with the idolatrous teaching of Balaam and the hierarchical teaching of the Nicolaitans (Rev. 2:12-17a). The Lord gave manna to the children of Israel openly. Every morning around their camp the manna was there in an open way for them to eat (Exo. 16:14-18). But a small portion of this manna was preserved in a golden pot within the ark in the tabernacle (16:33; Heb. 9:4). That is the hidden manna. The open manna is Christ as the common portion to all of God's people for them to enjoy in a public way. The hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church.</P><P>Only the overcoming seekers who enter into the Holy of Holies to experience Christ as the ark, God's testimony, enjoy a particular portion of the hidden Christ. We must have some deeper experience of Christ. Our experience of Christ should not merely be openly in the meetings, but hiddenly in the Holy of Holies, even in Christ Himself as the ark, the testimony of God. In Christ as the ark, we can enjoy Him as the hidden manna, as a particular portion for our life supply, to overcome the worldliness of the degraded church.</P><P>Such a worldly church has the idolatrous teaching of Balaam and the hierarchical teaching of the Nicolaitans. Today in Christendom these two kinds of teachings are prevailing. Balaam was a Gentile prophet who taught people for wages. He was a prophet for hire, and his teaching enticed God's people into fornication and idolatry (Num. 25:1-3; 31:16). The teaching of Balaam distracts believers from the person of Christ to idolatry and from the enjoyment of Christ to spiritual fornication.</P><P>The teaching of the Nicolaitans builds up a hierarchy among the believers. This teaching destroys the function of believers as members of the Body of Christ, thus annulling the Lord's Body as His expression. In both Roman Catholicism and the Protestant denominations, there is a hierarchical organization. In the religious organization of the Roman Catholic Church there are the bishops, the archbishops, the cardinals, and eventually the pope. In the Protestant denominations there is the system of clergy and laity. The teaching of the Nicolaitans is that only the clergy are qualified and positioned to preach, to speak for the Lord. The others are so-called laymen. This is hierarchy.</P><P>In the Lord's recovery, we have to overcome the clergy-laity system. All of us have the position as members of the Body of Christ to speak for the Lord. If someone asks us who our pastor is, we should say that everyone among us is a "pastor." All of us can speak for the Lord and teach the truth. Our speaking for the Lord in the meetings is the annulling of the hierarchy. We are the members of the organic Body of Christ, and every member has a particular function. The Lord desires to recover the functioning of all the members of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Being Transformed to Be a "White Stone"<br>according to the Transformation in Life</H2><P>God's work of building the church depends upon our transformation. As the overcomers, we need to be transformed to be a "white stone," justified and approved by the Lord, for the building up of the house of God, with a "new name" according to the transformation in life (Rev. 2:17b). In our natural being, we are not stones but clay. But we are being transformed from clay into precious stones for God's building. The color white signifies justification and approval. When we are transformed into a white stone, this means that we are justified and approved by the Lord for His building.</P><P>Some houses are made of adobe, but not the church. The church is built up with precious stones. These precious stones are the believers who have experienced transformation upon transformation (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18). Every transformed believer, as a white stone, bears a new name. Such a new name is the interpretation of the experience of the one who has been transformed. Hence, only he himself knows the meaning of that name. We receive a new name by our new experience according to the transformation in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Standing Strongly against<br>the Romish Teaching of Jezebel</H2><P>We need to be those who stand strongly against the Romish teaching of Jezebel, which is full of fornication, idolatry, and the deep things of Satan (Rev. 2:20, 24a). The Romish teaching of Jezebel is the teaching of the apostate Roman Catholic Church. This is clearly seen in the church in Thyatira in Revelation 2.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Fleeing the Spiritual Death and Walking<br>in "White Garments" without Any Defilement</H2><P>We have pointed out that with the church in Sardis in Revelation 3, everything is either dead or dying. In order to be the overcomers, we need to flee spiritual death. We need to be those who live in reality with nothing dying in imperfection. As the overcomers, we should walk in "white garments" without any defilement, so that our name will not be erased out of the book of life but confessed by the Lord before His Father and His Father's angels in the next age&#151;the kingdom age (Rev. 3:1-2, 4-5). To walk in white garments is to have a living that is unspotted by death and that is justified and approved in life by the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Keeping the Lord's Word of Endurance<br>and Not Denying the Lord's Name<br>unto the Last Bit of Their Power</H2><P>The overcomers in Philadelphia keep the Lord's word of endurance and do not deny the Lord's name unto the last bit of their power, that they may be kept out of the hour of trial which is coming to try all those who dwell on the earth and that they may receive the crown of reward to be pillars in the temple of God with the name of God, the name of the city of God, the New Jerusalem, and Christ's new name written upon them (Rev. 3:8b, 10-12). The hour of trial will be the time of the great tribulation. For all of these points concerning the overcomers it would be helpful to study Revelation 2 and 3 with all the notes in the Recovery Version. Then we will be able to understand much more.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Being Hot instead of Being Lukewarm</H2><P>We need to be hot, even burning, instead of being lukewarm, to buy gold refined by fire, white garments, and eyesalve, that we may not be spewed out of the Lord's mouth, but may be invited to dine with the Lord and to sit with Him on His throne (Rev. 3:15-21). We need to be those who dine, who feast, with the Lord in this age so that we can sit on the throne with the Lord in the kingdom age. To sit with the Lord on His throne will be a prize to the overcomer, that he may participate in the Lord's authority and be a co-king with Him to rule over the whole earth in the coming millennial kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A WORD CONCERNING THE LORD'S MOVE IN RUSSIA</H2><P>Now I would like to say something concerning the Lord's move in Russia. All of those who have some feeling to go there need to be sober in their consideration. To move from one country to another country in order to live there involves many things.</P><P>According to the Bible, especially in the New Testament, we Christians should be movable people. In Acts 1:8 the Lord said that the disciples would be His witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria and even unto the uttermost part of the earth. The disciples migrated to other places, not for making a living but for the gospel.</P><P>The Bible tells us that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived in tents (Heb. 11:8-9). A tent is a movable lodging place, with no foundation. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were always picking up their tents and moving to another place. They lived in a tent with an altar, that is, with the cross of Christ, to serve and worship God. This is why they were sojourners, pilgrims. This is the first principle of our Christian life. For a Christian who loves the Lord to get himself settled in a place permanently is not scriptural. We are pilgrims today on this earth, moving around all the time.</P><P>To have a proper view of the Lord's present move in Russia, we also need to understand God's economy concerning the human race. In Genesis 1 God made man in His image and after His likeness so that man could express Him in His image and represent Him with His dominion (vv. 26-28). Genesis later tells us that when Noah came out of the flood he built an altar to serve God, and that pleased God. Then Noah made a mistake by becoming drunk and naked. After that God used him to prophesy concerning his three sons&#151;Shem, Ham, and Japheth (9:18-27).</P><P>According to history, these three sons eventually became three big races. Japheth became the Europeans, and according to Noah's prophecy, Japheth would be enlarged by God. This means that the descendants of Japheth would be the strong ones to conquer and spread. Shem is the source of the races which are mostly from Asia, including the Jews. Palestine is a part of Asia. Ham became the father of the race which is mostly in Africa. Europe, Asia, and Africa come together geographically around the Mediterranean Sea. The Jewish land of Palestine is in the center of these three inhabited sections: Europe to the north, Africa to the south, and Asia to the east. About five hundred years ago, Columbus ventured to sail across the Atlantic, and he reached a new land, America. Thus, Japheth was further enlarged. The majority of the people in the United States are the descendants of the Europeans, who are the descendants of Japheth.</P><P>According to history, the strong people at first were with Assyria and with Babylon. Nimrod was the builder of these two great nations&#151;Assyria with Nineveh as the capital and Babylon with the city of Babel as the capital (Gen. 10:8-11; Micah 5:6). Assyria came first to invade and defeat Israel. Then Babylon followed Assyria to conquer Israel, to destroy Jerusalem, to burn the temple, and to exile all the children of Israel. Later, the Medo-Persian Empire followed Babylon to defeat Israel. Medo-Persia was the largest empire in history. Esther 1:1 tells us that it had one hundred twenty-seven provinces. Today in the Persian Gulf, we have these strong peoples. Iran is today's Persia, and Iraq is today's Babylon. They are fighting with each other and are still making trouble in the region of the world around the Mediterranean Sea.</P><P>The Bible in Daniel 7 tells us that four beasts come up out of the Mediterranean Sea, the Great Sea. The first beast signifies the Babylonian Empire, the second beast signifies the Medo-Persian Empire, the third beast signifies the Grecian-Macedonian Empire, and the fourth beast signifies the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire even reached Palestine, and the Lord Jesus was born under its rule.</P><P>If we read history carefully, we can see that God in carrying out His economy always went through the strong people. Christ was born as a captive of the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire was a strong nation. They built highways and opened up the traffic from Palestine to Rome and even to Spain. At that time people considered Spain the uttermost part of the earth. Greek was also made the common language throughout the Roman Empire. Even the Lord Jesus quoted from the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Old Testament.</P><P>On the one hand, Rome conquered and captured Palestine. But on the other hand, Rome prepared a good environment for the Lord Jesus to be born. Rome also afforded the means for the Lord Jesus to be crucified. Crucifixion was not a method of execution used by the Jews, but by the Gentiles (Ezra 6:11). Eventually, this method was adopted by the Roman Empire to execute heinous criminals. Christ's method of death, His being cut off, was a fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy.</P><P>After Christ's ascension, the apostles rose up to spread the gospel. Their spreading of the gospel was facilitated by the Roman highways on land and by the Roman means of sailing on the seas. Thus, the preaching of the gospel in the initial stage was through the strong nation of Rome. On the one hand, the strong nation of Rome persecuted and even crucified Christ, and also persecuted and martyred the apostles. But it was through this strong empire that the way was prepared for Christ to be born and crucified and for the gospel to be preached.</P><P>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, God used Great Britain as the world power through the practice of imperialism to pave the way to keep the order of the whole world for the mission work. The Lord also used England spiritually at that time for the spreading of His gospel throughout the world. Imperialism is the policy and practice of maintaining an empire through the conquest and domination of weaker countries. Politically speaking, imperialism is evil and should be condemned, but God is sovereign. Imperialism was used by the divine hand to spread the gospel. Otherwise, many backward countries would not have been opened up. Through imperialism, the weak, backward countries were compelled to open up. This gave a way for the missionaries to go into these countries with the gospel. Christ's birth, Christ's death, the spreading of the gospel in the early days of the church, and the mission work to spread the gospel to every corner of the earth all were through the strong people.</P><P>The descendants of Japheth, according to Noah's prophecy, have been the strong people. Most of the people of Europe, Russia, and the United States are Japheth's descendants. The western European nations today have about three hundred fifty million people. They have been divided, but they realize that they need to be united. Today they are talking about having a common currency. To the east of Europe there is the Russian commonwealth, which also numbers about three hundred fifty million people. In the United States, there are about two hundred million Caucasians. Thus, we can say there are about nine hundred million descendants of Japheth on this earth. One-third of them are the people in the Russian commonwealth. They are a very strong, cultured, educated, and thoughtful people. People's character and disposition have much to do with the climate zone in which they live. People in the cold regions are generally strong and strict.</P><P>After about seventy years of communism, the large population of Russia has been released from communist rule. They have been prepared by the Lord. Their mind has been emptied of other things, and they are now really empty, open, and hungry for the gospel. They want to know the Bible, and they like to hear American English. Our saints speak to them in English with the help of Russian translators. The Russians warmly welcome people who can teach them about God and about the Bible.</P><P>Within five weeks of labor in St. Petersburg, we baptized five thousand one hundred forty-two people. The three hundred fifty million people of Russia are so open that we could save and baptize a large percentage of them, but we need the baptizers. It was a miracle for us to baptize over five thousand people with only a little over thirty saints as baptizers. There are many practical things to do related to these baptisms.</P><P>I really appreciate the full-time workers in Russia. I was told that many times they did not have the time to eat or rest adequately because of the tremendous need. After baptizing all of these new believers, they have to go to their homes to have the home meetings to nourish them. Since we have only about thirty workers to take care of about five thousand new ones, each working one should take care of about one hundred eighty new ones.</P><P>The people of Russia have been prepared by the Lord, and if we do not go to them now, we will miss the opportunity. Their minds have been emptied and they are now open, but after another five years their minds could become filled up again. The need in Russia is there, but the way to meet the need is not with Christianity.</P><P>Over one thousand years ago, Russia was a wild country without a written language or a civilized culture. Then the Greek missionaries of the Greek Orthodox Church went to Russia. Today in the Russian alphabet, there are a number of Greek letters because some Greek missionaries made an alphabet for the people of Russia. The Russian Orthodox Church was established about ten centuries ago. This foundation of Russian orthodoxy was deeply laid. Even the communists, including Lenin and Stalin, could not shake this foundation. At the end of the seventeenth century, Peter the Great rose up. Before his time, Russia was basically an oriental culture in things such as their way of dress and in their eating. It was Peter the Great who revolutionized their civilization. He westernized Russia, and their way of clothing and eating was changed to the western style. They became western European, yet they were largely in the Asian territory.</P><P>History tells us that eventually, the royal family of Russia, the clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church, and the landlords all became corrupted. During the First World War, the czar sent his troops to fight against Germany. This gave Lenin the opportunity to stir up the peasants to revolt against the existing czarist government. In 1917 they were able to carry out their communist revolution. Now that communist rule is over in Russia, the door is wide open for the spreading of the Lord's recovery.</P><P>In principle we have to go to meet the Lord's need in Russia, but we should not do it lightly. As the churches, we should consider what percentage of our people have to go. We cannot send everybody; otherwise, we will suffer too much loss. The leading ones have to consider who is more useful here at home and who is more useful for the migration to Russia. This is why we like to receive the applications for those who desire to go to Russia. The saints can apply, but we have to discern and consider who should stay and who should go.</P><P>Also, we have to consider the financial support. To support one missionary to work in Russia requires over one thousand dollars a month. If we have one hundred going, we have to prepare one hundred thousand dollars a month for their support. This would amount to one million two hundred thousand dollars a year. This amount includes their lodging, their traveling, their furniture, their meeting places, and many other things related to the practical carrying out of the work there. Our present capacity among the saints for the financial support of the workers in Russia is not that high. At the beginning of our move to Russia, a large amount of offerings came in, but the offerings have decreased. We have to realize that the amount of offerings will not increase unless the Lord comes in to perform some miracle. Thus, we have to consider the number of persons who can go in light of the capacity of our financial ability.</P><P>Furthermore, if some saints desire to go, they have to consider their future. They have to consider their age, their family, how many children they have, how many children they are expecting to have, and the age of their children and how they will be educated.</P><P>Concerning the work in Russia, we do not know what tomorrow will bring. It could be that after five years, the Russians will not be that open. Their mind may become full of other things. They are a very capable, learned, and knowledgeable people with a strong character. Only the Lord knows how long this opening in Russia will last.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S ECONOMY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Col. 3:10-11; 1:15-19; Eph. 1:22-23; Rom. 12:5; Eph. 3:8-11, 2; 4:15-16; 1:10; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10-12; Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17; Heb. 1:8; Rev. 21:1-3; 22:1-2</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Taking Christ as its centrality and universality&#151;Col. 3:10-11.</li><li>Making Christ preeminent in all things&#151;Col. 1:15-19:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>In the Godhead&#151;v. 15a.</li>	<li>In the creation&#151;vv. 15b-17.</li>	<li>In the resurrection for the new creation, the church, the Body of Christ&#151;v. 18.</li>	<li>In the fullness of the Godhead&#151;v. 19.</li>	</ol></li><li>Producing the church to be:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Body of Christ&#151;Eph. 1:22-23:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The fullness of Him who fills all in all to be His expression.</li>		<li>An organism constituted with His members&#151;Rom. 12:5.</li>		<li>Built up:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>With the unsearchable riches of Christ through the divine dispensing&#151;Eph. 3:8-11, 2.</li>			<li>By the gifted members as the joints of the rich supply and by each one part operating in its measure&#151;Eph. 4:16.</li>			<li>Through the growth in life of the Body, holding Christ as its Head&#151;Eph. 4:15-16.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>For Christ to head up all things in Himself&#151;Eph. 1:10.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The house of God&#151;1 Tim. 3:15-16:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Composed of the many sons of God as the many brothers of Christ, the firstborn Son of God&#151;Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10-12.</li>		<li>The pillar and base of the truth.</li>		<li>The manifestation of God in the flesh&#151;the great mystery of godliness.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The kingdom of God&#151;Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>For the divine administration.</li>		<li>To express the divine authority&#151;Heb. 1:8.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Consummating in the holy city, the New Jerusalem&#151;Rev. 21&#151;22.</li>	</ol></li></ol><P>We have seen in the previous chapter that there are four races in the eyes of God&#151;the Adamic race, the Abrahamic race according to the flesh, the Abrahamic race according to the Spirit, and the overcoming race. Today we are near the end of a period of six thousand years since the creation of Adam. The age of the race of Adam lasted two thousand years up to the time of Abraham. In the Adamic race, the first figure was Adam and the last main figure was Nimrod, who built up Assyria with Nineveh as its capital and Babylon with Babel as its capital. Babel was the end of the age of the Adamic race.</P><P>Then God selected Abraham out of the idolatrous people of Chaldea, the site of ancient Babylon (Gen. 15:7; Acts 7:2-4). The age changed from the race of Adam to the race of Abraham according to the flesh. This age also lasted two thousand years. The first figure of this age was Abraham and the last main figure was John the Baptist. John the Baptist was a person in a time of transition from the Old Testament age to the New Testament age. The Old Testament strongly prophesied concerning him (Isa. 40:3; Mal. 3:1; 4:5). He should be considered as both the last one of the age of the race of Abraham according to the flesh and the first one of the age of the race of Abraham according to the Spirit.</P><P>When Abraham was called by God, God told him that his seed would be as the dust of the earth (Gen. 13:16) and as the stars of heaven (15:5). This meant that God would give Abraham two kinds of descendants. The descendants of Abraham according to the flesh are as the dust of the earth. These descendants are countless since there is no way to count the dust. Abraham's other descendants are as the stars of heaven. These are his spiritual descendants, the believers in Christ. In Galatians 6:16 Paul refers to the spiritual descendants of Abraham in a collective way as the Israel of God. This is the real Israel (Rom. 9:6b; 2:28-29; Phil. 3:3), including all the Gentile and Jewish believers in Christ, who are the true sons of Abraham (Gal. 3:7, 29).</P><P>From the divine viewpoint, the Adamic race occupied two thousand years of history and the Abrahamic race according to the flesh also occupied two thousand years of history. The spiritual descendants of Abraham as the spiritual, heavenly Israel have now occupied almost two thousand years also. Thus, God's economy has been among the human race for three periods of time&#151;two thousand years for the race of Adam, two thousand years for the race of Abraham physically, and about two thousand years for the descendants of Abraham spiritually. This is the history of mankind from the divine view. No secular historian would tell us that human history is divided into these three periods of time. Eventually, human history will enter into another age. That will be the age of the millennium, the kingdom of one thousand years.</P><P>The main thing in the approximately six thousand years of human history is the divine economy. Because we are near the end of this six thousand year period of time, we are at the threshold of the manifestation of the kingdom. God's economy has passed through almost six thousand years of human history. During this period of time, God's enemy, Satan, has done all that he can to frustrate the carrying out of God's economy.</P><P>The book of Job shows us that along with the divine economy, there is also the satanic chaos. Job 1:6 says, "Then one day, when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, Satan also came among them." Satan was permitted to enter into God's dwelling place in the heavens. Job then goes on to tell us about Jehovah's conversation with Satan (vv. 9-12). Satan was given the permission to touch all of Job's things, except his life. This shows that God does have an adversary. This adversary always comes alongside His economy. Where the economy of God is, there is also the satanic chaos.</P><P>The divine economy and the satanic chaos can be seen from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation. When God created the heavens and the earth, the angels were stirred up to sing and shout for joy (Gen. 1:1; Job 38:4-7), but right away Satan rebelled against God, bringing in chaos (Isa. 14:12-15; Gen. 1:2a). This story of the divine economy and the satanic chaos has been going on and on throughout the history of the universe. The New Testament opens with Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God becoming incarnated to be a God-man (John 1:1, 14). What a wonderful thing the incarnation of the Triune God was! But immediately after His incarnation, there was the satanic chaos. Herod sought to kill Christ in His infancy (Matt. 2:1-22).</P><P>Even in the new heaven and new earth, there will still be signs of the satanic chaos and the divine economy. The big sign, the unique sign, of God's economy will be the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of God's economy. Outside the city is a "trash can" which is called the lake of fire. The lake of fire is a strong sign of all the chaos from generation to generation throughout the ages. For eternity there will be two things&#151;a city of water and a lake of fire, signifying God's economy and Satan's chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT BEING DELIVERED OUT OF THE SATANIC CHAOS<br>BUT OVERCOMING AND CONQUERING IT TO TRIUMPH<br>IN GOD'S UNIQUE CONSTRUCTIVE ECONOMY</H2><P>In one meeting I heard someone pray, "Lord, deliver us from the chaos." I would like to ask whether this prayer is right or wrong. Some may say that this is right because the Lord Jesus told us to ask the Father not to bring us into temptation but to deliver us from the evil one (Matt. 6:13). We may, however, have a wrong concept about what this kind of deliverance is. God does not want us to be delivered out of the satanic chaos. What God wants is embodied in the words overcome and conquer. If God delivered us out of the satanic chaos, He would not need us to overcome it, to conquer it. God wants us to conquer the satanic chaos. The real deliverance to us from God is our conquering. In Ephesians 6 Paul told us that we need to be empowered in the Lord to stand against the stratagems of the devil (vv. 10-11). Then he said, "Therefore take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand" (v. 13). We are not to be delivered out of the chaos, but we are to stand against it.</P><P>While the carrying out of God's economy has been going on, the satanic chaos has been accumulating throughout the nearly six thousand years of human history. This accumulation has consummated in Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. Judaism did not come out of God's economy. Judaism is part of the satanic chaos. In Revelation 2:9 the Lord spoke to the church in Smyrna of the "synagogue of Satan."</P><P>We have seen that the church, due to its degradation, eventually became married to the world during the time of Constantine. At that time, the church actually became a kind of "anity," that is, Christianity. That "anity" was also an accumulation of the satanic chaos. The church's marriage to the world, as seen with the church in Pergamos (Rev. 2:12-17), eventually issued in Roman Catholicism, as seen with the church in Thyatira (vv. 18-29). In Roman Catholicism there is the hierarchy of bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. The universal papal system was established in the latter part of the sixth century. With the Catholic Church there is much heresy, much superstition, and many pagan practices. Catholicism is an accumulation of the satanic chaos. Judaism is the first accumulation and Catholicism is the second accumulation.</P><P>The seekers of the Lord could not tolerate the degradation of the church, so they stood up again and again in different centuries to carry out a certain amount of the Lord's recovery. Eventually, in the sixteenth century, Martin Luther rose up, and the Lord used him to recover the truth concerning justification by faith. Eventually, Protestantism came out of this period of reformation. The issue of the Reformation was the state churches, such as the Church of Germany, the Church of Norway, and the Church of England, today's Anglican church. Then some lovers of the Lord began to see truths from the Scriptures which were not present in the state churches. Thus, the private churches were formed, such as the Presbyterian church, the Baptist church, and the Methodist church.</P><P>In the eighteenth century, the Lord used Zinzendorf to recover something of the practice of the proper church life. Then in the nineteenth century, the Brethren under the leadership of John Nelson Darby went on to recover the church life in a further way. The Brethren began in 1828, but within ninety years they were divided into about one hundred divisions.</P><P>In the early part of the twentieth century, the Lord caught a young man in China named Watchman Nee, and the Lord used him to continue His recovery. Brother Nee once told me that both Europe and America had been spoiled as far as the Lord's move was concerned at that time. That forced the Lord to go to China, which Brother Nee said was "virgin soil" for the Lord to have a new start of the church life. We are now in the Lord's recovery of the proper church life for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</P><P>God's economy has passed through the Adamic race and also through the Abrahamic race, both physically and spiritually. Alongside this economy, there has been Satan's chaos, which has resulted in three accumulations, which are three "isms": Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. Because of the failure among the first three races and because of the accumulations of the satanic chaos with Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism, the Lord needs a fourth race, the race of the overcomers. In the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation, the Lord has a sevenfold calling for the overcomers.</P><P>According to church history, the Lord's recovery with His overcomers began in the second century. The divine revelation was fully completed in the first century with Paul's ministry and John's mending ministry. Within the first century, however, there was also the degradation of the church life. Even within such a short time after the completion of the divine revelation, the church fell into degradation, so there was the need of overcomers. Brother E. H. Broadbent in his book The Pilgrim Church pointed out that the line of the overcomers started in the second century and has continued throughout the centuries.</P><P>I was born in China far away from western Christianity, but thank the Lord, about one hundred fifty years ago, the Lord sent a number of the best missionaries to that old conservative country. They were real men of God who were honorable, faithful, and excellent in character. They opened up the door for the gospel. My mother was baptized because of their work. It was through this that I came into Christianity. After I was saved, the Lord gradually opened my eyes. I saw that since I was a man, I had to be a Christian, and if I was going to be a Christian, I must be an overcomer. I must come out of Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism to stand with the overcomers.</P><P>I was born in northern China, and Brother Nee was born in the south. Eventually, under the Lord's arrangement, we came into contact with each other. As a young believer, I was able to read his magazine called The Christian. When I read this, I was caught by the Lord. I realized that since I was a Christian, I had to be the same kind of Christian as Brother Watchman Nee was&#151;an overcomer. About seventy years ago, Brother Nee and I were among the progressive young people in China. We studied in modern schools and learned English. We were also very patriotic, but we were caught by the Lord to be overcomers.</P><P>We were called by the Lord to be one with Him to conquer His enemy, to overcome him. Some of us may feel that there is too much chaos today. Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism are a threefold chaos. We might want to ask the Lord to deliver us out of this. Instead of delivering us, however, the Lord might allow chaos to come to our place so that we would learn how to be one with Him to conquer it, to overcome it. We are in the Lord's recovery, which is for the carrying out of God's economy on this earth. Because of this, the satanic chaos is here also. The overcomers are not delivered out of this present chaos. Instead, the overcomers conquer all the destructive chaos and triumph in the unique constructive economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING AN OVERCOMER TO CONQUER JUDAISM, CATHOLICISM, AND PROTESTANTISM</H2><P>My burden in this chapter is to show us how to conquer the satanic chaos and what to conquer. We may feel that as Christians, we should conquer sin, the world, our flesh, and our self. But Revelation 2 and 3 show that the Lord wants us to conquer three things: Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. The Lord referred to those in Judaism as being of the synagogue of Satan. If anything of Judaism is still lingering in us, we will be defeated. We must conquer anything Judaistic.</P><P>We also have to conquer three kinds of teachings: the teaching of Balaam (Rev. 2:14), the teaching of the Nicolaitans (v. 15), and the teaching of Jezebel (v. 20). In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, these are three other teachings besides the apostles' teaching. The teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans are the teachings of today's Protestant churches. These teachings build up the organized system of Christianity. If we are going to be an overcoming believer, we have to conquer the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</P><P>The teaching of Jezebel is the teaching of the Catholic Church. In the eyes of God, the Catholic Church is an evil prostitute, a great harlot (Rev. 17:1). According to Revelation 17:5 this great harlot has daughters. The daughters of the apostate church must be all the different sects and groups in Christianity that hold to some extent the teaching, the practices, and the tradition of the apostate Roman Church.</P><P>The contents of the teaching of the Roman Church, the teaching of Jezebel, is first the worshipping of idols. The Catholic cathedrals are full of idols. In his book The Great Prophecies, G. H. Pember points out that even Buddha has entered into Catholicism. In the Catholic calendar, there is a saint named Josaphat, whose story is actually that of Buddha (see message fifty-one of the Life-study of Revelation, p. 585). Alexander Hislop, in his book The Two Babylons, exposes the origin of the evil, demonic, pagan things that were brought into the apostate church. Also with the Catholic Church there are the deep things of Satan (Rev. 2:24).</P><P>We have to be the overcomers who conquer everything of Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. In the eyes of the Lord, these three "isms" are more evil than sin, than the world, and than our self. Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism should be the first category of things that you and I have to conquer. It is worthwhile to study the outline at the beginning of chapter three, which is concerning the overcomers spoken of in the epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3. The Lord charges us in these epistles to conquer, to overcome, Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism.</P><P>The book of Revelation tells us that Antichrist will destroy all religions at the beginning of the great tribulation. He will exalt himself above all gods and force people to worship him (Dan. 8:9-11; 11:36-37; 2 Thes. 2:3-4; Rev. 13:4-6, 12, 14-15). He will persecute the apostate Roman Church and destroy it. Revelation 17:16 says, "And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and burn her utterly with fire." This harlot is the Catholic Church, and the beast is Antichrist. This verse prophesies clearly that Antichrist will burn the Catholic Church, will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh. Peter tells us that we need to give heed to the prophetic word as to a lamp shining in a dark place (2 Pet. 1:19). Such prophecy is a lamp to our feet (Psa. 119:105).</P><P>Surely we should not remain in anything of Judaism, Catholicism, or Protestantism. If we are going to be overcoming believers, we have to overcome, to conquer, these three kinds of "isms." This is why I spent nearly seven years to overthrow the system of one man speaking in the churches. Such a system is according to the teaching of the Nicolaitans (concerning the Nicolaitans&#151;see Rev. 2:6 and note 61 and Rev. 2:15 and note 151). In 1937 Brother Watchman Nee saw the need to have the church meeting in mutuality as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14. This fellowship is in his book The Normal Christian Church Life. At that time, however, we could not find a way to replace the one man speaking service in the Lord's Day morning meeting. Over ten years later in 1948, Brother Nee spoke concerning this again in his book Church Affairs. He said that this system is hard to overthrow, but if you push, I push, and everyone pushes, eventually this evil system will be pushed away.</P><P>The real factor of this recent turmoil was that I was working to push away the practice of one man speaking and the rest listening, that is, the Lord's Day message meeting in the churches. The leading dissenting ones would not say that they opposed this, but actually this was the real case. They thought that if this practice were pushed away, they would lose their "jobs." They were fond of speaking to a congregation. It is not a small matter to give up the practice of one man speaking and the rest listening, the practice of the Lord's Day message meeting. Brother Nee said that this practice was according to the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8&#151;NASB). This is a part of the "isms" which we have to conquer.</P><P>In order to push away the clergy-laity system, the system of one man speaking and the rest listening, we must be those who speak for the Lord. If all of us rise up to speak for the Lord, the clergy-laity system will be pushed away. If we come to the Lord's Day meeting in a neutral way without the intention to speak for the Lord, we are contributing to this system. Our silence, our not functioning, our not opening up our mouths to speak in the meeting, is what constitutes the system of one man speaking.</P><P>All of us need to rise up to speak for the Lord. The more we speak, the younger we become. If we want to reduce our oldness, we need to speak. If we do not speak in the meeting, we may feel that the meeting was poor. The meeting was poor to us because we did not speak. Every meeting in which we speak is a meeting in the heavens. The more we exercise to speak for the Lord in the meetings, the higher the meetings are to us and the more we love the meetings.</P><P>The Lord is pleased with our speaking because we are conquering and annulling the destructive chaos by our speaking. After these past seven years, a number of churches have tasted the riches and the sweetness of the prophesying meeting, the church meeting in mutuality. By this kind of practice, many of the young people among us will be trained to speak. If the Lord had not led us into the God-ordained way of meeting with all functioning, there would have been no way for us to take up the work in Russia today. The saints who are serving in Russia are all speaking for the Lord. I want to say again that in every aspect of our practical church life, we must remember that we have to conquer Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TAKING CHRIST AS ITS CENTRALITY<br>AND UNIVERSALITY</H2><P>If we are to be the overcomers, we need to be clear about God's economy. Christ is the centrality and universality of the divine economy (Col. 3:10-11). Actually, God's economy is just Christ. What God desires to have is Christ. Christ is God's good pleasure and His unique goal.</P><P>The New Testament shows us this in Ephesians 1 and 3. These chapters speak of God's good pleasure (1:5, 9) and God's eternal purpose, God's heart's desire (3:11). God's good pleasure is Christ. A church without Christ as the centrality and universality is not pleasant to God. God could never be pleased with a church without Christ. God does not want to see merely a group of people meeting and serving together. He wants to see Christ among them, and He is concerned about how much Christ is among them. How much God would be pleased with us depends upon how much Christ we have. Everything we do must be in Christ, with Christ, by Christ, through Christ, and to Christ.</P><P>Christianity's gospel preaching is for soul winning, but our gospel preaching is the practice of the New Testament gospel priesthood for saving sinners to make them members of Christ, parts of Christ. Then we offer these parts of Christ as an offering to God (Rom. 15:16). In the Old Testament, the sacrifices which the priests offered were all types of Christ. Today in the New Testament economy, we offer the members of Christ. In other words, we offer the Body of Christ. To preach the gospel merely to win souls is not adequate. We preach the gospel to make sinners the living members of Christ to constitute Christ's Body, so that we can offer them to God for the constitution of Christ's Body.</P><P>As priests of the gospel, we need to visit people in a regular way to bring the gospel to them. D. L. Moody once made a decision that he would preach the gospel to at least one person a day. One night he went to bed, and he realized that he had not preached the gospel to anyone that day. He went out into the street, and the only one he saw was a policeman. He went to that policeman and exhorted him to believe in the Lord Jesus. Then Moody hurried home. Later, the policeman wanted to know who this person was who spoke to him about believing in the Lord. The policeman found out that this person was D. L. Moody. Then he went to see D. L. Moody, and he was saved. This shows us that we should fulfill our duty as priests of the gospel to regularly visit people so that we can make them the members of Christ for the increase and building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. MAKING CHRIST PREEMINENT IN ALL THINGS</H2><P>God's economy also makes Christ preeminent in all things (Col. 1:15-19). To have the preeminence is to have the first place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In the Godhead</H2><P>Christ, in the whole universe, is the first. He is even the first in the Godhead (v. 15a). The Godhead has three&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Of the three, the Son is the center. The embodiment of the Triune God is Christ, the Son, so He is the center. Colossians 1:18b says that Christ has the first place, the preeminence, in everything. He is the image of the Triune God. If you have the image, you have the person. This shows us that Christ is the very center of the Divine Trinity. He is both the image and the embodiment of the Triune God.</P><P>Christ, the preeminent One, is a living, organic person, and the Body of Christ is an organism, not an organization. A wooden stand is an organization of pieces of wood, but a living person is an organism. The church is not mechanical. It is not a robot. The church is an organism. If we want the church to be living, we should not come to the meetings and sit in our chair the entire time to merely listen to others. That makes us mechanical, not organic. We need to exercise our spirit to sing to the Lord, praise the Lord, and speak for the Lord. When we say "amen," we should say it in a living way with the exercise of our spirit. Not only prophesying needs our practice; even saying "amen" needs our practice.</P><P>Sometimes the best part of the Lord's table is when everyone makes a "noise" to the Lord. If we are always so orderly and organized in what we do, our meeting might be like a cemetery. In a cemetery there is no noise, and everything is very orderly. But the church is living, so the church has to make a joyful noise to the Lord (Psa. 98:4, 6; 100:1). If we do not exercise our spirit in the church meetings, we will die. Exercise is the secret of being healthy. In the church meetings, we should be living and active in the Spirit. In this way Christ will have the preeminence in our meetings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In the Creation</H2><P>Christ also has the preeminence, the first place, in the creation (Col. 1:15b-17). He is the Firstborn of all creation, the One who has preeminence among all the creatures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In the Resurrection for the New Creation,<br>the Church, the Body of Christ</H2><P>Christ is also preeminent in the resurrection for the new creation, the church, the Body of Christ (v. 18). In the old creation, He is the Firstborn. In the new creation, in resurrection, in the Body of Christ, He is also the Firstborn. Christ is the first in resurrection as the Head of the Body. As such, He has the first place in the church, God's new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. In the Fullness of the Godhead</H2><P>Christ also has the preeminence in the fullness of the Godhead. Colossians 1:19 says that "in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell." Actually, the fullness in this verse is Christ Himself. Christ is the center, Christ is the embodiment, Christ is the image, and Christ is the fullness. Thus, in every way, in every aspect, and in everything, Christ must have the first place, the preeminence. In the church life, everything must be for giving Him the preeminence, the first place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. PRODUCING THE CHURCH</H2><P>God's economy takes Christ as its centrality and universality, makes Christ preeminent in all things, and also produces the church to be the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God, consummating in the holy city, the New Jerusalem. Whatever we do in the God-ordained way is for Christ to produce the church. We are here living a church life to take Christ as the center and to make Christ the preeminent One for the purpose of producing the church, the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Body of Christ</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Fullness of Him Who Fills All in All<br>to Be His Expression</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ as the One who fills all in all to be His expression (Eph. 1:22-23). Christ is immeasurably full, vast, and great. Ephesians 3:18 speaks of our apprehending the universal dimensions of Christ&#151;the breadth and length and height and depth. How broad, how long, how high, and how deep is the universe? The breadth, the length, the height, and the depth are the immeasurable dimensions of the universe, and these dimensions are the dimensions of Christ. Because Christ is so vast, He needs the Body of Christ as His fullness, His expression.</P><P>We need to be those who live Christ and magnify Christ for His expression. If Christ is not full in us, we cannot express Him. We can illustrate this by the amount of water in a cup. If the cup is not full of water, no one can see the water. Thus, the water is hidden, concealed, not expressed. When the cup is filled with water to the extent that it is overflowing, this overflow of water is the expression. When the cup is overflowing with water, everyone sees the expression. Nobody knows that we have Christ in us, so we need to be overflowing with Christ.</P><P>We overflow with Christ by speaking Christ. When we overflow, Christ flows. This overflow is Christ's expression, and this expression is the fullness. The Bible does not tell us to come to the meetings to be quiet. This is the practice of degraded Christianity. The architecture of the cathedrals and many denominational meeting places, with their stained-glass windows which do not let in much light and their high ceilings, promotes people's silence. Our meeting places are not like this. Our meetings should not be full of silence but full of the divine speaking for the exhibition of Christ, the expression of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. An Organism Constituted with His Members</H2><P>The Body of Christ is an organism constituted with His members (Rom. 12:5). As the members of the Body of Christ, we are the living parts of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Built Up:</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. With the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</H2><P>The Body of Christ needs to be built up with the unsearchable riches of Christ through the divine dispensing (Eph. 3:8-11, 2). This is the stress, the emphasis, of the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. By the Gifted Members and by Each One Part</H2><P>The Body of Christ is built up through the divine dispensing by the gifted members as the joints of the rich supply and by each one part operating in its measure (Eph. 4:16). The gifted members must be active, living members. They dispense the rich supply, which is the supply of Christ. Each one part also needs to operate in its measure. We may feel that we are not the gifted members, so we are not needed. But all of us are parts of the Body, and we need to operate according to our measure. We should not merely function, but function in fullness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Through the Growth in Life of the Body</H2><P>The Body of Christ is also built up through the growth in life of the Body, holding Christ as its Head (Eph. 4:15-16). Through the growth in life, the church is built. To build anything, we first need the material. The material for the building of the church is the riches of Christ. In order to build, we also need the skill. In the church we need "smiths," that is, skilled people. Gifted persons are "smiths" and the operating parts are small "smiths." We also need a way to be built up, and the way is to grow. If we do not grow, there is no church building. The church building is constituted with the riches of Christ, by the gifted persons and the operating parts, and through the growth in life of all the saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. For Christ to Head Up All Things in Himself</H2><P>Eventually, such a built up church is for Christ to head up all things in the universe in Himself (Eph. 1:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The House of God</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Composed of the Many Sons of God<br>as the Many Brothers of Christ,<br>the Firstborn Son of God</H2><P>The church is also the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15-16). The house of God is composed of the many sons of God as the many brothers of Christ, the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10-12). We are the Body with Christ as the Head. We are also a house with Christ as the firstborn Son among many sons, His many brothers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Pillar and Base of the Truth</H2><P>The church as the house of God is also the pillar and base of the truth. As the pillar, the church supports the truth, and as the base, the church holds the truth. The truth is the Triune God with Christ as the embodiment, as the center, and as the image to produce the church to be the organism as Christ's Body, as God's home, and as God's kingdom. Anything else is not the truth, and to teach anything else is to teach differently. Doctrines such as head covering, foot washing, and methods of baptism are doctrines, but not the truth which we need to teach. The truth is just one thing&#151;the Triune God, having Christ as the center, the embodiment, the image, and the expression, to produce the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God. We are one in this truth. We are not one in the different small points in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Manifestation of God in the Flesh&#151;<br>the Great Mystery of Godliness</H2><P>The church as the pillar and base of the truth is the manifestation of God in the flesh, and this is the great mystery of godliness (1 Tim. 3:15-16). The church is the continuation of Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Kingdom of God</H2><P>The church is also the kingdom of God (Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17). The kingdom of God is for the divine administration to express the divine authority (Heb. 1:8). We should be people under authority, and among us there should be the divine administration. Romans 14:17 says that today the church life is the kingdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Consummating in the Holy City,<br>the New Jerusalem</H2><P>Eventually, the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God will consummate in the holy city, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21&#151;22). Revelation 21:2 says that the holy city, New Jerusalem, will come down out of heaven from God. First, the New Jerusalem will be in the heavens in the thousand-year kingdom. The overcomers will be there as the co-kings of Christ in the heavenly part of the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. After the thousand-year kingdom, all the saints will be matured and will be included in the New Jerusalem. Then the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven. Our dwelling place for eternity will be the New Jerusalem on the new earth. We are in the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God, and we are on our way to becoming the new city, the New Jerusalem.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CHURCH LIFE IN GOD'S ECONOMY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:20-21a; John 21:15-17; Rev. 2:4; Phil. 3:12; 1 Cor. 1:9; Col. 1:12, 18b; 1 Tim. 4:6; Eph. 4:3-4, 12, 16; 3:8-10, 2; Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11; John 17:21-23; Rev. 1:12, 20b; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; 1 Cor. 4:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; 1 Pet. 2:2; Heb. 10:24-25; 1 Cor. 14:1-5, 12, 31, 40; Col. 3:10-11</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>To live and magnify Christ --Phil. 1:20-21a:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To love and treasure Christ --John 21:15-17; Rev. 2:4.</li>	<li>To pursue and gain Christ --Phil. 3:12.</li>	<li>To enjoy and partake of Christ --1 Cor. 1:9; Col. 1:12.</li>	<li>To exalt and minister Christ --Col. 1:18b; 1 Tim. 4:6.</li>	</ol></li><li>To build up the Body of Christ --Eph. 4:12:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To keep the universal oneness of the Body --Eph. 4:3-4.</li>	<li>By all the members of the Body, perfected in the local churches --Eph. 4:12:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Either as the joints of the rich supply of Christ.</li>		<li>Or as parts of the Body operating in their measure --Eph. 4:16.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>With the unsearchable riches of Christ --Eph. 3:8-10.</li>	<li>Through the divine dispensing --Eph. 3:2.</li>	</ol></li><li>To meet as a proper local church --Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>On the genuine ground of the unique oneness of the Body --Eph. 4:3-4; John 17:21-23.</li>	<li>As a local expression of the universal Body of Christ.</li>	<li>As a local golden lampstand --Rev. 1:12, 20b.</li>	<li>As the pillar and base of the truth for the manifestation of God in the flesh --the great mystery of godliness --1 Tim. 3:15-16.</li>	<li>Meeting and serving in mutuality according to the God-ordained way:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Fulfilling the New Testament gospel priesthood for begetting --Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; 1 Cor. 4:15.</li>		<li>Nourishing and cherishing the new believers in home meetings --John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; 1 Pet. 2:2.</li>		<li>Perfecting the saints in group meetings that they may be able to do the work of the ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ --Eph. 4:12; Heb. 10:24-25.</li>		<li>Prophesying in the church meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ through the local churches --1 Cor. 14:1-5, 12, 31.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Having the adequate and proper leadership for the keeping of a good order (1 Cor. 14:40) with the all-inclusive Christ as the center and the processed Triune God as the manifestation --Col. 3:10-11; 1 Tim. 3:15-16.</li>	</ol></li></ol><P>In chapters one and two, we saw the divine economy and the satanic chaos in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. Then in chapter three we saw the overcomers. We all should say, "If I am a man, I have to be a Christian. If I am a Christian, I have to be an overcomer. If I am an overcomer, I have to prophesy, to speak for the Lord. If I prophesy, I have to open up my mouth. If I open up my mouth, I have to exercise my spirit. If I open up my mouth and exercise my spirit, I speak forth Christ." To speak forth Christ is to exhibit Christ. We all need to fan into flame the gift of God which is within us (2 Tim. 1:6) to be those who speak for the Lord. We should not be those who are hot for only a short time. We need to be burning in spirit all the time (Rom. 12:11). Our burning should be eternal. In order to be the overcomers, we need to cooperate with the Lord to speak Him forth for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:4b).</P><P>After seeing the revelation concerning the overcomers, we saw the truth concerning God's economy in chapter four. In this chapter we want to see the church life in God's economy. The preceding chapters in this book are all directed toward this goal --the church life in God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE STANDING OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Many have opposed us because of our stand for the truth that there should be only one church in a locality (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11) as a local expression of the one Body in the universe (Eph. 4:4). There are many so-called churches today, and it seems that people feel the freedom to start a church in the same way that someone would feel the freedom to open a restaurant. But we need to practice the church life according to God's way as revealed in the New Testament. Acts 8:1 speaks of the church in Jerusalem. At that time there were thousands of believers in Jerusalem. On the day of Pentecost, three thousand were added to the church there (2:41). Later, five thousand more were added (4:4). Eventually, James told Paul that there were tens of thousands of believers in the city of Jerusalem (21:20). According to Acts 8:1 these myriads of believers were the one church in Jerusalem. Regardless of how many believers there are in a city, they are still the one church in that city. When the church life spread to Antioch, the believers there met as the church in Antioch (13:1).</P><P>Revelation 1:11 says, "What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea." John was told to send what he wrote to the seven churches. To the seven churches equals to seven cities --to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea. The first to, to the seven churches, equals the seven tos, to the seven cities. This indicates that a church in a certain city should be equal to that city. The practice of the church life in the early days was the practice of having one church for one city, one city with only one church.</P><P>When we say that we are the church in a certain locality, such as the church in Los Angeles, this is not a name but a description of a fact. We are just the church. The church does not have a name just as the moon does not have a name. Once in the Far East, someone was so impressed with the United States that he said even the moon was bigger there. But there is no such thing as an American moon or a Chinese moon. Just as there is one moon, there is only one church. When the moon appears in London, it is the moon in London; when it appears in Los Angeles, it is the moon in Los Angeles. Regardless of where the moon appears, it is still the same moon. Just as there is the moon in Los Angeles and the moon in London, there is the church in Los Angeles and the church in London. There is one church, and this church is manifested or expressed in different localities.</P><P>In the degraded situation today, however, there are many so-called churches. There are churches denominated according to race, such as Chinese churches and Korean churches. There is an Anglican church, an Episcopalian church, in Anaheim, and there are churches representing Taiwan in Anaheim. There are also churches named after the street on which they meet. This shows us the situation of division and confusion today. Even the unbelievers wonder why there are so many divisions among Christians. They may ask, "Since you all have the same Christ and read the same Bible, why are there so many different denominations?"</P><P>I grew up in a city called Chefoo in mainland China. I was educated there and worked there. At a certain point, I gave up my job to serve the Lord full-time. Within a short period of time, the Lord used me to gain a number of people, and I spoke the truth to them concerning the church. There were a number of missionaries in Chefoo at that time, and they were surprised that my preaching was attracting so many people. They were also concerned about my speaking regarding the church being one and the denominations being divisions. I used the illustration of the moon as I did above, pointing out that there is only one church, one Body, expressed in different cities.</P><P>As a result of my preaching and teaching, a number of people gave up their denominations and came together to meet with me. This bothered many of the pastors and elders of the denominations in Chefoo, especially since I grew up in that city and we knew one another. One day some leading ones from the denominations in Chefoo joined together and invited me to eat with them. After they finished talking to me about what bothered them, I presented the truth concerning the church to them. I asked them, "Would you please tell me how many Christs and how many churches there are in this universe?" They all said, "One." Then I said, "There is just one church, but each of you represents one denomination, so seven denominations are represented here. Are you seven denominations, one church?" Of course, they were not one church. I pointed out to them that in 1 Corinthians Paul rebuked the Corinthians for saying, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" (1:12). Paul said, "Is Christ divided?" (v. 13). I then asked these few leading ones, "If Paul were here today, would he not rebuke you for meeting in division?" They answered, "Yes."</P><P>Then I said, "All of you know me. I grew up among you. I was working in this city for seven and a half years. But then the Lord touched me to give up my job and serve Him with all of my time. I do not have any organization or person supporting me. I am doing this because I love the Lord. I have given up everything for Him. You all know this." I asked them, "Don't you believe I will preach the Lord Jesus to many people and that my preaching will have some result?" Then I asked them, "Where should I put these ones who are saved through my preaching? Should I put them into your denominations?" Then they said, "No, you should not put them into any denomination." Then I asked where I should put them, and they could not answer.</P><P>They had told me earlier that I should not open a building for people to come together to meet with me. Instead, they wanted me to rotate among their denominations and preach there. I told them that I could not accept this, because they were not the church. They were the denominations, and every denomination is a division. To meet in denominations is to divide the church, which is the unique Body of Christ. I asked them how I could put the result, the fruit, I reaped from my preaching into the denominations, into the divisions. I said that this was why I was forced to open up a meeting place. Then I said, "Have you noticed that on our meeting place, we do not have a signboard telling people what kind of church we are. But all of you have a signboard declaring to people what denomination you are. We do not have such a signboard because we do not like to be denominated. Once we are denominated, we become a division, and division in the Body of Christ is abominable in the eyes of the Lord." They were all silenced.</P><P>Then I said, "I am willing to close the door to our meeting place, if you will do one thing." I said, "Please go back to your places and take off the signboards which designate your denomination. Then let us all come together to be the one church in Chefoo. If you promise to do this, I will go back directly to close the door of our meeting hall." Then they said that they surely could not do this. I responded, "Sirs, since you cannot do this, I have to meet in our meeting place. I presented to you my willingness to close the door to our meeting place, but you are not willing to take off your signboards to deny every denomination and recognize one church. You are meeting in division, but we are meeting in oneness as the church." Soon after my meeting with these leading ones, we increased even more. I hope this fellowship will help us to answer those who would ask us why we say that we are the church. Just as the moon cannot be designated, the church cannot be designated, and thus denominated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPEAKING FOR THE LORD ONE BY ONE<br>AND DOING ALL THINGS BECOMINGLY AND IN ORDER</H2><P>Now that we have seen something concerning our standing as the church according to the divine revelation, we need to see the church life in God's economy. The unique God has a unique economy, and in this divine economy God produced the church. The church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23), the organism of the Triune God, and this organism is the expression, the manifestation, of the invisible Triune God. The church is also God's house (1 Tim. 3:15-16). God's house is not only His dwelling place but also His family, His folks. This house is also His kingdom, where He administrates and rules (Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17).</P><P>Today's Christianity is full of organization, but the church as the living Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God. According to Revelation 3:1 the church in Sardis as a prefigure of the Protestant church has a name that she is living, but she is dead. Death is more defiling before God than sin (Lev. 11:24-25; Num. 6:6-7, 9). We have to be careful that we do not become like a corpse, with no life and no livingness. A local church should be living and full of life. This is why I encourage all the saints to speak for the Lord. The first amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees the right of free speech to everyone. In a sense, all the denominations take away the saints' first civil right because of their clergy-laity system. No one is allowed to speak except the clergy.</P><P>When we exercise our civil right to speak for the Lord, we should not exercise it in a wild way but in a proper way. In 1 Corinthians 14:40 Paul says that in the church meetings, "all things must be done becomingly and in order." I am happy to see the young people among us excited and released, but their speaking when they are too excited can be like thunder. Suppose that the heavens thundered all the time. No one would be able to live in such an environment. It is all right for the young people to make a joyful noise for a short period of time, but this should not be prolonged. When we shout and speak, we must learn to shout and speak orderly. We all have to learn how to function in a proper way for the building up of the church.</P><P>Yes, we all can prophesy, but our prophesying in the meeting should not be disorderly because Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14:31 that we can all prophesy "one by one." We should not forget that it is "one by one," not three by five. When someone is speaking in a meeting, we have to wait until he is finished before we speak. We have to keep the principle of "one by one."</P><P>In the church meetings, all things should be done becomingly and in order. If you are going to shout in a meeting, you have to learn how to shout becomingly and in order. Even in an athletic contest, there are some rules which need to be kept. If we are going to be "crazy," excited, in the meetings, we have to be excited orderly.</P><P>We may think that when we are orderly, we cannot be excited and that when we are excited, we cannot be orderly. This shows that there is the need of a proper order in our meetings. We Christians are not rioters. We may be excited, but we are excited in an orderly way. When someone is prophesying, I should wait for him to finish before I speak. To keep the principle of speaking one by one is to be excited becomingly.</P><P>Sometimes the young people may be too active and too noisy, whereas the older saints may be too retired. If the young people are functioning too much, the older saints should have the realization that it is now their turn to function. In the church life, we need saints of all ages for the Lord's testimony. When there is a blending of the functioning of the saints of all ages, this is "music." When the young people function in a very loud and excited way, this is not music. With music there is a variation in sound, that is, in tone, rhythm, speed, and accent. If the young people are functioning in an over-excited way, the older saints should then take the lead to say something for the Lord, to speak forth Christ. Then our meeting will be full of "music."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TO LIVE AND MAGNIFY CHRIST</H2><P>The first item in the church life in God's economy is that we need to be those who live and magnify Christ (Phil. 1:20-21a). If we do not live Christ and magnify Christ in our daily life, we are not practical members of a practical church. We need to live Christ day by day from morning to evening. If people can see only what we are in our natural being, we are not living and magnifying Christ. We must live a life to show people Christ. Christ should be magnified in us by our living Him. Merely to claim that we are the church is not adequate. We must show even the angels, the demons, and the evil spirits that we are a people who live Christ to magnify Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Love and Treasure Christ</H2><P>To be those who live and magnify Christ we have to love and treasure Christ (Rev. 2:4). After His resurrection, the Lord came back to Peter in a particular way. Not long before this, Peter had denied the Lord to His face three times (John 18:17, 25, 27). I believe that Peter was very ashamed. No doubt, he still remembered his failure. Now the Lord Jesus asked him also three times, "Do you love Me?" Peter said, "Lord, You know that I love You." Then the Lord charged Peter to feed His lambs, to shepherd His sheep, and to feed His sheep (John 21:15-17). The Lord loves His lambs and His sheep, and He is very concerned for them. If we love Him, we should love them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Pursue and Gain Christ</H2><P>In order to live and magnify Christ for the church life in God's economy, we also need to pursue and gain Christ (Phil. 3:12). To pursue in Greek means to persecute. To pursue Christ is to persecute Christ in a positive sense. Before Paul was saved, he persecuted Christ. After he was saved, he pursued Christ to such an extent that he persecuted Christ, but in a positive way. We need to be those who desire to gain Christ to such an extent that we would lay hold of Him, not letting Him get away from us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Enjoy and Partake of Christ</H2><P>We also need to be those who enjoy and partake of Christ. God has called us into the fellowship of His Son that we may enjoy Christ as our God-given portion (1 Cor. 1:9). Christ as the allotted portion of the saints is our divine inheritance for our enjoyment (Col. 1:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To Exalt and Minister Christ</H2><P>Finally, we need to exalt and minister Christ (Col. 1:18b; 1 Tim. 4:6). In our meeting life, we have to exhibit Christ. But if we do not live Him and magnify Him by loving and treasuring Him, pursuing and gaining Him, enjoying and partaking of Him, and exalting and ministering Him, we cannot exhibit Him in the meetings. To exhibit Him requires a life of living Him that He might be magnified. Living and magnifying Christ is the first condition, first term, first requirement, for us to live the church life in God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TO BUILD UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>We live and magnify Christ in order to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12). God has no intention of having individual Christians. God's intention is to have one corporate Body composed of all the saved ones and constituted with the transformed believers. Some may not like anyone except themselves and the Lord Jesus. They may want to meet merely with the Lord by themselves. But our enjoyment of the Lord by ourselves does not compare with the sweetness and richness of Christ which we enjoy when we meet with the saints. We need the Body. The Lord wants us to love Him by meeting together with all of His lovers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Keep the Universal Oneness of the Body</H2><P>In order to build up the Body of Christ, we need to keep the universal oneness of the Body (Eph. 4:3-4). We should not only keep the oneness among the saints in our locality, our region, or even merely in the United States. We must keep the oneness universally with all the saints all over the earth. The Lord's recovery has even spread to Russia and is beginning to spread to Eastern Europe, including Albania. We can travel through the entire earth and meet with the churches. When we are traveling, we do not necessarily need to stay at hotels or motels. There are always some "churchtels" where we can stay. We enjoy the universal oneness of the Body in the Lord's recovery. The church life has people of all colors --white, black, yellow, brown, and red. This is because we are the universal one new man, where Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:10-11).</P><P>In the recent rebellion, some were teaching that a local church should be autonomous. In a sense, we may say that a local church is autonomous in business affairs, but no local church is absolutely autonomous. We can illustrate this by considering the United States. Each state of the United States is autonomous to an extent, but not absolutely autonomous. This is because there is a federal, central government. National defense, currency, the postal system, and the interstate highways are federal matters. If a legal case cannot be decided at the local or state levels, it goes to the Supreme Court at the federal level. If all the states were absolutely autonomous, the United States would no longer be united but divided. In like manner, all the churches around the globe are one Body, and we must keep the universal oneness of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By All the Members of the Body,<br>Perfected in the Local Churches</H2><P>The Body of Christ is built up by all the members of the Body, perfected in the local churches (Eph. 4:12). Now that we are regenerated, we need to be perfected in order to be renewed, sanctified, and transformed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Either as the Joints of the Rich Supply of Christ</H2><P>The Body is built up by all the members. Some of these members are the joints of the rich supply of Christ (Eph. 4:16). These are the gifted ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Or as Parts of the Body<br>Operating in Their Measure</H2><P>The Body is also built up by the parts of the Body operating in their measure (Eph. 4:16). The gifted ones are one kind of member, and the parts are another kind. If we are not the gifted ones, we are the parts who should operate according to our measure for the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. With the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</H2><P>The Body of Christ is built up with the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Through the Divine Dispensing</H2><P>The organic building up of the Body is with the unsearchable riches of Christ through the divine dispensing (Eph. 3:2). While we are speaking Christ, something is moving within us, and this moving is the dispensing. We can illustrate this with electricity. When electrical appliances are operating, electricity is moving within them. The moving of electricity, the current of electricity, is the dispensing of electricity. We also have a divine current within us. When we do not function, the divine current, the moving of the Spirit, stops within us. Then there is no dispensing of the divine electricity, no dispensing of the Spirit. Our not speaking Christ is the stopping of the moving of the Holy Spirit. When we rise up to speak for the Lord, we have the moving of the Spirit within us, and that moving is the dispensing.</P><P>This divine dispensing results in our growth in life. If we attend a meeting and do not function, we may feel dissatisfied and empty afterward. But if we exercise our spirit to function in the meeting, we will be filled with the Lord. We grow by the moving of the Spirit within us, and this moving is the dispensing of the divine supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. TO MEET AS A PROPER LOCAL CHURCH</H2><P>In order to practice the church life in God's economy, we need to meet as a proper local church (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11). Christians are not like butterflies. Every butterfly is very individualistic and beautiful. We Christians are like bees and like sheep. Bees like to be grouped together. When they move, they move together. Sheep also like to be flocked together. When they follow their shepherd, they are together in a becoming and orderly way. The Lord Jesus called us the little flock (Luke 12:32). Peter exhorted the elders to shepherd the flock of God (1 Pet. 5:2). Paul also exhorted the elders in Ephesus to shepherd the church of God (Acts 20:28). As the flock of God, we must learn to meet regularly. Christians are meeting people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. On the Genuine Ground<br>of the Unique Oneness of the Body</H2><P>We need to meet as a proper local church on the genuine ground of the unique oneness of the Body (Eph. 4:3-4; John 17:21-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. As a Local Expression<br>of the Universal Body of Christ</H2><P>We meet on the ground of the church as the local expression of the universal Body of Christ. Christ does not have many bodies. He has only one Body, but this one Body is expressed in many localities. The local churches standing on the ground of oneness are the local expressions of the unique, universal Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. As a Local Golden Lampstand</H2><P>A proper local church is a local golden lampstand (Rev. 1:12, 20b). Gold signifies the divine nature. This shows that the churches as the golden lampstands are constituted with the divine nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. As the Pillar and Base of the Truth<br>for the Manifestation of God in the Flesh --<br>the Great Mystery of Godliness</H2><P>The truth is the Triune God, taking Christ as His center and His circumference so that the church as the Body of Christ, as the organism of the Triune God, can be produced. The church is the pillar to support such a truth and the base to hold such a truth. In our daily life, we should live Christ. In our meetings, we should exhibit Christ. Christ should be everything to us for the Body to express Him as the organism of the Triune God. This is our truth.</P><P>Outside the Lord's recovery, this truth cannot be heard. Some may talk about marriage and family life. Others may speak the gospel in a fundamental way, telling people that they are sinners but that God loves them, Christ died for them, and if they believe in Him, they will be forgiven and go to heaven. Then they may go further to tell people that after they are saved, they should conduct themselves in an upright way to glorify the Father. But who speaks concerning the church as the pillar and base of the truth? According to the divine revelation, the truth is the Triune God, taking Christ the Son as the embodiment and as the centrality and universality of His divine economy to have a church to express Him as His organism.</P><P>First Timothy 3:15-16a says, "But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness." The truth is the great mystery of godliness, which is the manifestation of God in the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Meeting and Serving in Mutuality<br>according to the God-ordained Way</H2><P>For the church life in God's economy, we need to meet and serve in mutuality according to the God-ordained way. Our meetings should be in mutuality with all the saints of different ages functioning for the building up of the church. A meeting in mutuality is "music."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Fulfilling the New Testament<br>Gospel Priesthood for Begetting</H2><P>To meet and serve according to God's ordained way is first to fulfill the New Testament gospel priesthood for begetting (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; 1 Cor. 4:15). Our preaching of the gospel is not merely for winning souls. It is for begetting sinners to make them the sons of God, the brothers of Christ, and the members of Christ to constitute Christ's Body. This Body is the house of God and the kingdom of God which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Nourishing and Cherishing<br>the New Believers in Home Meetings</H2><P>The new believers who have been begotten through our preaching of the gospel need to be nourished and cherished in home meetings (John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; 1 Pet. 2:2). We should not gather them into our home. Instead, we need to go to their homes and bring them "food to go." When we go to people's homes, we should not go in a formal, ritualistic, and religious way. If we do this, we spontaneously become the clergy. We need to start the home meetings in a rejoicing, singing way. As we are approaching the door of the new ones' homes, we should be singing. The new ones will hear our singing, and they will respond to this. If we are going to care for the new believers, we cannot take our natural way. This is why we need to learn and be instructed and trained to practice the God-ordained way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Perfecting the Saints in Group Meetings<br>That They May Be Able to Do the Work of the Ministry,<br>That Is, to Build Up the Body of Christ</H2><P>The God-ordained way also includes perfecting the saints in group meetings that they may be able to do the work of the ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12; Heb. 10:24-25). In addition to feeding the new ones in their homes, we should gather them together for group meetings. The group meetings should not be formal, but very spontaneous and living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Prophesying in the Church Meetings<br>for the Building Up of the Body of Christ<br>through the Local Churches</H2><P>Finally, we need to prophesy in the church meetings for the building up of the Body of Christ through the local churches (1 Cor. 14:1-5, 12, 31). We need to learn to prophesy, that is, to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord in order to minister Christ to people. If we all exercise our spirit in the meetings to prophesy, we will have living, fresh, uplifted, and rich meetings. Then the universal Body of Christ will be built up through the local churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Having the Adequate and Proper Leadership<br>for the Keeping of a Good Order<br>with the All-inclusive Christ as the Center<br>and the Processed Triune God as the Manifestation</H2><P>To meet as a proper local church, we need to have the adequate and proper leadership for the keeping of a good order (1 Cor. 14:40) with the all-inclusive Christ as the center and the processed Triune God as the manifestation (Col. 3:10-11; 1 Tim. 3:15-16). In every church, we should have the proper leadership, and this leadership is the deputy authority, the authority representing God in His administration.</P><P>According to the principles ordained in God's government, deputy authority is everywhere on earth. In a family there are the parents; in a school there are the teachers and the principal; and in a city there are the mayor and the police with the law courts. Without the proper government and the police, a city would not be in the proper order. It would become riotous without any deputy authority.</P><P>In the church life, we need to keep a good order by taking, receiving, and accepting the proper leadership. Among the saints there are always some who can take the leadership according to the apostles' teaching. Actually, the proper leadership is the apostles' teaching (Acts 2:42), the teaching of the New Testament. The apostles' teaching is our leadership. This is similar to saying that the Constitution of the United States is our country's leadership, the highest authority. The president takes the lead according to the Constitution. If the president is mistaken in anything, he will be corrected by the Constitution. Our constitution in the Lord's recovery is the apostles' teaching, the teaching of the New Testament. The teaching of the New Testament is our leadership. When we have the adequate and proper leadership in the churches, we can have a becoming and orderly church life to exhibit Christ and to glorify the Father.</P></body></html>
