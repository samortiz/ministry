For two thousand years Christians have acknowledged one thing, that no one can know the Lord well without knowing the Bible.</p><p>The spiritual inheritance which God has given to us includes, on the one hand, the invisible Holy Spirit and, on the other hand, the visible Holy Bible. On the one hand, the Spirit is within us; on the other hand, the Scripture is outside of us. A proper Christian must be balanced in these two sides. If we only have the Holy Spirit within but do not have the Scripture without, we will make mistakes easily. If we only have the Scripture without, but do not have the Holy Spirit within, we will become dead, without vitality or livingness.</p><p>A Christian is like a train which needs motivating power within and tracks without. Having these two aspects&mdash;the inward and the outward&mdash;coordinating together, the train can move, even move very well. This is exactly true of the Holy Spirit within us and the Holy Scriptures outside of us. If you are filled with the Holy Spirit within and you also know the Bible without, then, as a Christian, you are living and stable, and you are also active and accurate. You are a Christian who is living and stable as well as active and accurate.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE ORIGIN OF THE BIBLE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Bible Being God-breathed</h2><p>The Scripture is God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16). This tells us that the Scripture did not come out of man&rsquo;s thought, man&rsquo;s mind, but rather, it is God&rsquo;s breathing His thought and His word through His Spirit into and out of the writers. Hence, the Bible contains God&rsquo;s elements and carries His flavor. As Christians, our greatest joy, or shall we say, our greatest blessing, is to be able to contact God and taste Him daily through the word of His breath.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Bible Being the Speaking from God<br />by Men Borne by the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Since the Scripture is God&rsquo;s breathing His word out from men through His Spirit, no word of the Scripture can be of man&rsquo;s will; rather, men were borne by the Spirit and spoke out of God. The word, &ldquo;men spoke from God, being borne by the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:21), has a twofold meaning: first, men were borne by the Spirit; second, men spoke from God. In the original Greek, being borne by the Holy Spirit means being carried along as a ship by the wind. The writers of the Bible received God&rsquo;s inspiration, and they were under the power of the Holy Spirit, being borne and carried along by Him to speak out God&rsquo;s word. Furthermore, when they spoke, they spoke from within God. It was the Spirit of God carrying men along to speak, and it was also men speaking from within God. In other words, it was God speaking His own word from within men through their mouths.</p><p>Second Samuel 23:2 says, &ldquo;The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.&rdquo; This word was spoken by David. He told us that the words he spoke were the speaking of the Spirit of God through him, and that it was God&rsquo;s word that was in his tongue. Not only the Holy Spirit spoke through him, but also God&rsquo;s word was in his tongue and was spoken from his mouth. This is the Bible.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Bible Being God&rsquo;s Speaking<br />in the Prophets and in the Son</h2><p>The Old Testament is God&rsquo;s speaking in the prophets; the New Testament is God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son, our Lord Jesus (Heb. 1:1-2). Hence, whether it is the speaking of the prophets in the Old Testament or the speaking of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament, both are God&rsquo;s speaking and both are of God.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Bible Being the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s Revelation</h2><p>John 16:13 says, &ldquo;But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s word here also proves that after the Spirit&rsquo;s descension, what His disciples spoke and wrote was disclosed to them by the Spirit. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s word here proves that after His ascension, all the books of the New Testament, written by His disciples, were of the Spirit&rsquo;s revelation and their divine authority was acknowledged by Him.</p><p>The Scripture, therefore, is the word written by men under God&rsquo;s command (Exo. 34:27), the word of the Spirit of God spoken through men, the word of God spoken through man&rsquo;s mouth (2 Sam. 23:2), and the word spoken by men who were moved by the Spirit (Mark 12:36). The Old Testament is the word spoken by the prophets under God&rsquo;s command (Jer. 1:7), the word of God coming upon the prophet (Ezek. 1:3), and the word of the Spirit of God spoken through the prophets (Zech. 7:7; Acts 3:18; 28:25; Rom. 1:2; 1 Pet. 1:10-12). Some portions of the New Testament are God&rsquo;s speaking in the Lord Jesus (John 14:10), while other portions are words written by the apostles as taught by the Spirit (1 Cor. 2:13). The words written by the apostles as taught by the Spirit are as sacred as the Old Testament Scriptures (2 Pet. 3:15-16). Hence, the entire Bible originates from God; every word and every sentence, every iota and every tittle (Matt. 5:18), are God-inspired. Hence, men should neither add to or take away anything from the Holy Scriptures (Rev. 22:18-19).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BIBLE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Testifying concerning the Lord Jesus</h2><p>The first function of the Bible is to testify concerning the Lord Jesus (John 5:39). The Lord Jesus is the subject and contents of the Bible; the Bible is the explanation and expression of the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is God&rsquo;s living Word; the Bible is God&rsquo;s written Word. The Bible, God&rsquo;s written Word, must have the Lord Jesus, the living Word, as its reality; otherwise, it is but mere doctrines and empty letters. The Lord Jesus, the living Word, must have the Bible, the written Word, as His expression; otherwise, He is mysterious and difficult to know, vague and hard to grasp. However, since there is the clear, definite explanation and plain revelation of the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus can be known practically and comprehended definitely by men. Not only every book of the New Testament reveals the Lord Jesus, but every part of the Old Testament, whether (1) the Law of Moses, (2) the Prophets, or (3) the Psalms (these are the three major parts of the Old Testament), testifies and speaks concerning the Lord Jesus. Hence, if we want to know the Lord Jesus, we must read and understand the Bible.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Making Men Wise unto Salvation</h2><p>The functions of the Bible are of two aspects: one aspect is to serve the Lord, and the other aspect is to serve us. On the one hand, it testifies of the Lord Jesus and, on the other hand, it causes us to receive grace and be built up. The first function of the Bible toward us is to make us wise unto salvation (2 Tim. 3:15); it reveals to us how God saves men in Christ, and how men may be saved by faith, so that we may know the way of salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Causing Men to Be Regenerated</h2><p>The first practical function of the Bible in us is to cause us to be regenerated (1 Pet. 1:23). The Bible is the Word of the living God, and it contains the life of the living God. When we receive the word of the Scriptures into us by faith, it comes into us like a seed of life, sowing God&rsquo;s life into us; thus, we have God&rsquo;s life and are regenerated.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Being the Believers&rsquo; Spiritual Milk</h2><p>When we first get saved, we do not have a strong enough comprehension concerning spiritual things. Some portions of the Scriptures are like milk that can nourish us and make us grow in our spiritual life (1 Pet. 2:2). Hence, a newly regenerated believer must long for the word of the Bible, like newborn babes longing for the guileless milk of the word. Otherwise, his spiritual life cannot grow, and he will continue to be one who is an infant in Christ (1 Cor. 3:1-2).</p><h2 class="head2">E. Being the Believers&rsquo; Bread of Life</h2><p>The word of the Scriptures is also our spiritual bread of life (Matt. 4:4). Just as our physical life needs nourishment, so also our spiritual life needs nourishment. The nourishment of our spiritual life can only be supplied by the word of the Bible. In order to be living and strong before God, we cannot depend on bread alone, but on every word, that is, the word of the Bible, that proceeds out through the mouth of God. We must take the word of God as food and eat it (Jer. 15:16), even regarding the word of the Bible as more important than our food (Job 23:12b). Otherwise, our spiritual life cannot grow. We must practice to have our faculties exercised in apprehending the word of the Bible so that we may be able to understand the words that are hard to interpret; that is, like those who are mature, we can eat the solid food (Heb. 5:13-14). Otherwise, our spiritual life cannot be strong.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Making the Believers Complete</h2><p>The teachings of the Bible can give us endurance, encouragement, and hope (Rom. 15:4). Many Christians have fallen into tribulation and sickness. Being unable to bear it, they feel sorrowful and hopeless, but when they read a portion or a sentence of the Bible, they have the enduring strength in their hearts, or they receive unspeakable comfort, and thus obtain hope that is beyond their expectation. The Bible also records many things as warnings to us that we may be admonished, be on the alert, and not repeat the former mistakes (1 Cor. 10:11). Hence, after our regeneration, the Bible is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that we, the men of God, may be complete (2 Tim. 3:16-17).</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE WRITERS OF THE BIBLE,<br />THE PLACES WHERE IT WAS WRITTEN,<br />AND THE TIMES WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Old Testament</h2><p>The Old Testament, from Genesis to Malachi, is composed of thirty-nine books. The writers included Moses, Joshua, Samuel, Ezra, Nehemiah, David, Asaph, Heman, Ethan, the sons of Korah, Solomon, Agur, Lemuel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, etc., at least thirty-two people. Among them there were men of letters, statesmen, and military men; there were priests, kings, and prophets; and there were common people, shepherds, and farmers.</p><p>The books of the Old Testament were written in various places; some were written on Mount Sinai, some in the wilderness, some in the land of Canaan, some in Jerusalem, and some in Gentile lands.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The New Testament</h2><p>The New Testament, from the Gospel of Matthew to Revelation, is composed of twenty-seven books.</p><p>The Gospel of Matthew was written by Matthew. Matthew was a tax collector of low estate, yet he was called by the Lord to be one of His twelve apostles. His Gospel was probably written in the land of Judea.</p><p>The Gospel of Mark was written by Mark. Mark was a very ordinary disciple. His Gospel was probably written in Rome.</p><p>The Gospel of Luke was written by Luke. Luke was a Gentile physician. His Gospel was probably written in a Gentile land.</p><p>The Gospel of John was written by John. John was a Galilean fisherman with little education, yet he was called by the Lord to be one of His twelve apostles. His Gospel was probably written also in a place of the Gentiles.</p><p>The Acts was also written by Luke the physician. This book was probably written also in a Gentile place.</p><p>From Romans to Hebrews there are altogether fourteen books; they were all written by Paul. Paul was a radical member of the Judaic religion. Moreover, he was a man of great learning; he was talented, competent, aggressive, and capable of outstanding achievements. He was especially called by the Lord in his early years to be the apostle to the Gentiles. All his books were written in Gentile places; some were written in prison at Rome.</p><p>The Epistle of James was written by James. James was a flesh brother of the Lord Jesus (Gal. 1:19); he was also a devout Christian who became a pillar of the church (Gal. 2:9), but retained a great deal of the background of Judaism. His Epistle was probably written in Jerusalem.</p><p>The First and Second Epistles of Peter were written by Peter. Peter was also a Galilean fisherman with limited education, but he was called by the Lord to be the first of His twelve apostles. Both of his Epistles were probably written in Gentile lands.</p><p>The First, Second, and Third Epistles of John were also written by John. They were all written in Gentile places.</p><p>The Epistle of Jude was written by Jude. He was also a flesh brother of the Lord (Jude 1; cf. Gal. 1:19). His Epistle was probably written in the land of Judea.</p><p>Revelation was also written by the Apostle John. This book was written in a Gentile place, probably on the island of Patmos.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Times</h2><p>The first few books of the Old Testament&mdash;the Pentateuch&mdash;were written approximately in 1500 B.C.; the last book, Malachi, was written about 400 B.C. Therefore, the entire Old Testament of thirty-nine books took 1,100 years to complete.</p><p>The first book of the New Testament, the Gospel of Matthew, was written around A.D. 37-40; the last book, Revelation, was written around A.D. 94-96. Therefore, the New Testament was completed in over fifty years. Thus, in the completion of the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, there was a time separation of 1500-1600 years.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE COMPLETION OF THE BIBLE&mdash;<br />THE RECOGNITION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE BIBLE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Old Testament</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Pentateuch</h2><p>The five books of Moses in the Old Testament have always been recognized by the Jews as having come from God and having absolute divine authority, because they were revealed by God, written by Moses, and passed down through the generations by their fathers. Up to this day, although the Jews recognize the entire Old Testament as originating from God, they have always given the five books of Moses a special position. At least two or three copies of the Pentateuch are to be found in every Jewish synagogue throughout the world. The Jews may not have the other books of the Old Testament, but they will always have the five books of Moses.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Other Books</h2><p>The other books of the Old Testament, because of their value and authority, were also recognized, one after another, by God&rsquo;s people as having come from God. A certain writer has said that a tree does not necessarily need to have its name labeled, but it only needs to grow, blossom, and bear fruit, and then it will naturally be recognized by men as to what kind of tree it is. Similarly, it is not really necessary to mark out clearly whether the different books of the Bible are of God, for as each book passes through the test of time, its value and authority will spontaneously become manifest. This word is really well said and true. Following the Pentateuch, throughout the generations some among God&rsquo;s people were inspired to write the word of God. What they had written, after an extended period of testing by time, was recognized by God&rsquo;s people as having originated from God, because authority and power were found in their writings.</p><p>In 457 B.C., Ezra the scribe collected the Pentateuch and the authoritative writings generally acknowledged among God&rsquo;s people and arranged them to form the Old Testament. (However, two books&mdash;Nehemiah and Malachi&mdash;were missing because they were not yet written.) Both Josephus, the authoritative Jewish historian, and the Gentile historians confirmed this matter.</p><p>After Ezra, among the Jews there was a group of scribes called the Great Synagogue that continued to do the work of compilation and reviewing; the work was completed in 400 B.C. The Old Testament which they confirmed contained all the books we have today. Hence, by 400 B.C. not only the writing of the Old Testament was completed, but the Old Testament had also been confirmed and generally recognized. In any case, at the latest by 277 B.C., when seventy scholars translated the Old Testament into Greek, all the books of the Old Testament must have been established.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The New Testament</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Gospels</h2><p>The Gospels and the Old Testament were frequently read in the early church meetings. Hence, among the books of the New Testament, the four Gospels were the earliest ones to be recognized by the church.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Other Books</h2><p>After the passing away of the apostles, confusion arose due to some who wrote books by assuming the identity of others. Hence, the leaders in the early churches, the so-called church fathers, collected all the writings of the apostles and ranked them together with the Gospels. Shortly after the martyrdom of Polycarp, all the churches generally agreed in their view concerning the New Testament except for Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and Revelation. There was still disagreement as to whether these seven books should be included in the Bible or not. Nevertheless, because these seven books were definitely written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, possessing divine authority and value, after another long period of testing by time, in the year A.D. 397, at the council held in Carthage, which was in the northern part of Africa, the leaders of the churches gathered together and recognized these seven books as a part of the New Testament. They also announced that the New Testament was comprised of twenty-seven books, similar to what we have today. Hence, by A.D. 397, during the council of Carthage, the entire Bible, including the Old and New Testaments, was generally acknowledged and confirmed by God&rsquo;s people.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The entire Bible is God&rsquo;s breath. Each book of the Bible is God&rsquo;s revelation with every line and word coming from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The Scripture is infallible. The functions of the Bible are: 1) it testifies concerning the Lord Jesus; 2) it makes man wise unto salvation and is the seed of regeneration in man; 3) it is the believers&rsquo; spiritual milk and food; and 4) it makes the man of God complete.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>What is the origin of the Bible?</li><li>What are the functions of the Bible?</li><li>How many books are there in the Old and New Testaments respectively?</li><li>How long did it take to complete the writing of the Bible?</li><li>When was the authority of the Old and New Testaments acknowledged?</li><li>Name all the books of the New Testament.</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL ONE</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE TRIUNE GOD</h1><h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>God being only one.</li><li>God having the aspect of three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>God speaking as I and also as Us.</li><li>The matter of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</li></ol></li><li>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexisting simultaneously from eternity to eternity:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit all being God:<ol class="decimal"><li>The Father being God.</li><li>The Son being God.</li><li>The Spirit being God.</li></ol></li><li>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit all being eternal:<ol class="decimal"><li>The Father being eternal.</li><li>The Son being eternal.</li><li>The Spirit being eternal.</li></ol></li><li>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexisting simultaneously.</li></ol></li><li>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit coinhering and being inseparable.</li><li>The Three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash; being one:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The Son being the Father.</li><li>The Son (the last Adam) becoming the life-giving Spirit.</li><li>The Lord (the Son) being the Spirit.</li></ol></li><li>The reason for God being triune.</li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><p>The Bible reveals that God is triune. This is a revelation of great importance. God is uniquely one, and His name is Jehovah; yet this God is also triune&mdash;He is the Father, Son, and Spirit. This is a mystery; in fact, it is a mystery of mysteries. Small and finite as we are, we human beings cannot understand it thoroughly; even less can we define it in a full way. Many things relating to the matter of life are not within the comprehension of men; men can only have a general idea of them. For instance, though we have life in our physical body, no one can explain it thoroughly, for life is a mystery. Furthermore, there is a spirit within us&mdash;this is even more of a mystery. No one can give a full explanation of what the life of man and the spirit of man are. We are not able to comprehend such a comparatively small mystery as man, to say nothing of the great mystery of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit. If we cannot fully understand man, how much less the Triune God!</p><p>Nevertheless, we can receive and enjoy this mysterious God. We cannot understand, but we can enjoy! In former days men had no knowledge of vitamins, though they greatly enjoyed their benefit. The Triune God is not for us to understand, but to enjoy. All that He is for us to enjoy is revealed in the Scriptures; we cannot fully understand it, yet we may, according to all that is declared in the Scriptures, accept whatever is said.</p><p>Although we cannot find the term &ldquo;triune&rdquo; in the Scriptures, we can see the fact concerning the Trinity of the Godhead. Let us now examine the verses in the Bible that are more evidently related to this matter.</p><h2 class="head1">I. GOD BEING ONLY ONE</h2><p>The Scriptures in many instances and in many ways tell us that God is uniquely one. Both in the Old Testament and in the New, there are many passages which clearly and definitely tell us that God is only one. First Corinthians 8:4 says, &ldquo;There is no God but one,&rdquo; and Isaiah 45:5 says, &ldquo;I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God besides me.&rdquo; Similar words also can be found in Isaiah 45:6, 21, 22; and 44:6, 9.</p><p>In these passages God repeatedly says, &ldquo;There is no God besides me.&rdquo; He does not say, &ldquo;There is no God besides us,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;There is no God besides me.&rdquo; Me is singular, only one. These repeated declarations of God strongly prove that God is uniquely one.</p><p>Psalm 86:10 says, &ldquo;Thou art God alone.&rdquo; Here it does not say, &ldquo;Ye are God alone,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Thou art God alone.&rdquo; This also proves that God is only one.</p><p>That God is one is a clear and definite revelation of the Scriptures; it is also a fundamental and consummate principle.</p><p>Perhaps some will ask, &ldquo;Since God is only one, why did God speak of Himself as Us in Genesis 1:26? And why did He say Our image? Is there just one God, or is there more than one?&rdquo; The answer is: He is the Triune God; He is one, yet three&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">II. GOD HAVING THE ASPECT OF THREE&mdash;<br />THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT</h2><h2 class="head2">A. God Speaking as I and Also as Us</h2><p>In Isaiah 6:8 God says, &ldquo;Whom shall <em>I</em> send, and who will go for <em>us?&rdquo;</em> God speaks of Himself on one hand as I and on the other hand as Us. This proves that I is Us and Us is I; I and Us are identical. Then, is God singular or plural? If you say He is plural, He says I. If you say He is singular, He says Us. This is rather mysterious and difficult to understand; so we simply take the scriptural revelation as it is.</p><p>Furthermore, Genesis 1:26 says, &ldquo;And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.&rdquo; That the only God, in His divine word, speaks of Himself a number of times as Us is truly a mystery which is hard for us to understand. Nevertheless, we must believe that it is because of God being the Father, Son, and Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Matter of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit</h2><p>The Lord says in Matthew 28:19, &ldquo;Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord here clearly speaks of Three&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit. But when He speaks here of the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, the name which is used is in the singular number in the original text. This means that though the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three, yet the name is one. It is really mysterious&mdash;one name for Three. This, of course, is what is meant by the expression three-one, or triune.</p><p>Is the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, as spoken by the Lord here, the name Father, or Son, or Holy Spirit? It is difficult to answer. All we can say is that the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is &ldquo;Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This name includes the Three&mdash;Father, Son, and Holy Spirit&mdash;and tells us that God is triune. Although God is only one, yet there is the matter of the Three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT<br />COEXISTING SIMULTANEOUSLY<br />FROM ETERNITY TO ETERNITY</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />All Being God</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Father Being God</h2><p>Undoubtedly, the Father is God. Many passages in the New Testament speak of God the Father. For example, 1 Peter 1:2 says, &ldquo;According to the foreknowledge of God the Father.&rdquo; Ephesians 1:17 says, &ldquo;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory....&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Son Being God</h2><p>The Son is also God. Hebrews 1:8 says, &ldquo;But as to the Son, Your throne, O God....&rdquo; Here the Son is called God. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; The Word must be Christ, the Son. Because the Word is God, the Son also is God. Not only so, Romans 9:5 says, &ldquo;Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever.&rdquo; Christ the Son is not only God, but He is over all, God blessed forever.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Spirit Being God</h2><p>In Acts 5:3-4 we see that the Spirit is God. In verse 3 Peter told Ananias that he had lied to the Spirit; but in the next verse he said that he had lied to God. In these two verses the Holy Spirit equals God. Therefore, the Scriptures clearly reveal to us that all Three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are God. This does not mean, however, that They are three Gods. We have already seen that the Scriptures tell us clearly and definitely that God is only one. Although there are three&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;yet the Three are not three Gods, but one. This is really a mystery! It is unsearchable! But praise the Lord, we can simply receive and enjoy this mysterious One according to what the Scriptures have said!</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />All Being Eternal</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Father Being Eternal</h2><p>Isaiah 9:6 contains the expression &ldquo;the everlasting Father.&rdquo; According to its literal meaning in Hebrew, this expression may be rendered &ldquo;the eternal Father.&rdquo; Hence, the Father is eternal.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Son Being Eternal</h2><p>The Son also is eternal. Hebrews 1:12 says concerning the Son, &ldquo;You are the same, and Your years shall not fail.&rdquo; Hebrews 7:3 also says that the Son has no beginning of days nor end of life, which means that He is eternal.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Spirit Being Eternal</h2><p>The Spirit also is eternal because Hebrews 9:14 speaks of &ldquo;the eternal Spirit.&rdquo; Hence, all Three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are eternal.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit<br />Coexisting Simultaneously</h2><p>John 14:16-17 says, &ldquo;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality.&rdquo; In these two verses the Son says that He will pray to the Father that the Father may send the Spirit. Hence, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit exist together at the same time.</p><p>In Ephesians 3:14-17 Paul says that he will pray to the Father that He would grant us to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into our inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts. In this passage we have the Father, the Spirit, and Christ the Son. All three exist together at the same time. The Scriptures do not say that the Father existed for a period of time, then the Son came; and that after another period of time, the Son no longer exists but has been replaced by the Spirit. Not one verse says this. This portion of the Word shows that the Father hears the prayer, the Spirit strengthens the saints, and the Son&mdash;Christ&mdash;makes His home in our hearts. From this we can also see clearly that all Three coexist simultaneously.</p><p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; Here it mentions the grace of Christ the Son, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. All Three exist together at the same time.</p><p>Therefore, we do not believe that the Father ceased to exist and was replaced by the Son, then after another period of time the Son was replaced by the Spirit. We believe that the Three&mdash;Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;are eternal and co-existent.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT<br />COINHERING AND BEING INSEPARABLE</h2><p>The relationship among the Father, the Son, and the Spirit of the Trinity is not only that they simultaneously coexist, but, even more, that they indwell one another mutually. Coexistence means to exist together at the same time. Coinherence, as applied to the Trinity, means that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in one another and thus exist together.</p><p>The Scriptures clearly indicate that when the Son comes, the Father comes with Him; similarly, when the Spirit comes, both the Son and the Father come with Him. Furthermore, when the Son comes, the Father does not come with Him outwardly; rather, the Father comes with Him inwardly and subjectively.</p><p>John 6:46 says, &ldquo;Except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;from&rdquo; in the original language carries the sense of &ldquo;from with.&rdquo; The Son not only comes from the Father, but He comes from with the Father.</p><p>John 5:43 says, &ldquo;I have come in the name of My Father.&rdquo; The Son&rsquo;s coming in the name of the Father equals the Father&rsquo;s coming. This proves that when the Son comes, the Father comes.</p><p>John 14:10 says, &ldquo;I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me.&rdquo; This indicates that the Father does not come with the Son outwardly; rather, He comes in the Son.</p><p>Hence, the Son can testify saying, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9).</p><p>John 15:26 says, &ldquo;But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father....&rdquo; The second &ldquo;from&rdquo; is also &ldquo;from with&rdquo; in the sense of the Greek. When the Spirit comes, He also comes from with the Father.</p><p>John 14:26 says, &ldquo;The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name.&rdquo; The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, will be sent by the Father in the Son&rsquo;s name. The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s coming in the Son&rsquo;s name equals the Son&rsquo;s coming. This proves that when the Holy Spirit comes, the Son comes.</p><p>Furthermore, John 8:29 says, &ldquo;He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone.&rdquo; Luke 4:1 also says, &ldquo;Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit....&rdquo; These verses prove that when the Son is living on earth, both the Father and the Spirit are with Him; the Three are inseparable.</p><p>The Triune God has never been separated. When One moves, the other Two also move with Him. When One is sent, the other Two also come with Him. When the Son comes, He comes in the name of the Father; when He comes, the Father comes. When the Spirit is sent, He is sent in the name of the Son; His being sent is the Son&rsquo;s being sent. Hence, the Son&rsquo;s coming is the Father&rsquo;s coming, and the Spirit&rsquo;s being sent is the Son&rsquo;s being sent. The Three&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;are one. They cannot be separated for eternity.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE THREE&mdash;THE FATHER, THE SON,<br />AND THE SPIRIT&mdash;BEING ONE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Son Being the Father</h2><p>Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father.&rdquo; In this verse, the mighty God matches the child, and the everlasting Father matches the Son. Yes, He is a child, yet He is the mighty God. The child who was born in the manger of Bethlehem was the mighty God. Just as the child and the mighty God are one, so also the Son and the everlasting Father are one. The Son is the eternal Father. It is indeed difficult to fully explain this matter, yet the Scriptures have said so. Unto us a son is given and his name shall be called everlasting Father. Does this not plainly say that the Son is the Father? If the Son is not the Father, how could the Son be called the Father? If we acknowledge that the child of which this verse speaks is the mighty God, then we must also acknowledge that the Son of which this verse speaks is also the everlasting Father; otherwise, we are not believing the clearly stated revelation of the Scriptures. But we do deeply believe that according to the words here, the Lord Jesus who became the child is the mighty God; and the Lord Jesus who is the Son is also the eternal Father. Our Lord is the Son, and He is also the Father.</p><p>John 14:7-11 says, &ldquo;If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him. Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us. Jesus said to him, Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.&rdquo; In these verses the Lord clearly reveals to us the mystery that He and the Father are one. He is in the Father and the Father is in Him; when He speaks, it is the Father who works; when men see Him, they see the Father; when they know Him, they know the Father, because He is the Father; He and the Father are one (John 10:30).</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Son (the Last Adam)<br />Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>First Corinthians 15:45 states, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; The last Adam, of course, is the incarnated Lord Jesus, and the life-giving Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit. There can never be another life-giving Spirit besides the Holy Spirit. Therefore, this verse also tells us clearly that the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit. The Lord was made flesh and became the last Adam, and later, after death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit. The words spoken by the Lord in John 14:16-20 also confirm this point. Here the Lord tells us that He will pass through death and resurrection to become another Comforter, that is, the Spirit of reality, who will come to abide with us and dwell in us. In verse 17, the Lord says that the Spirit of reality &ldquo;abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; Then in verse 18 He says, &ldquo;I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.&rdquo; Over thirty years ago in Shanghai, when Brother Watchman Nee was explaining this passage to us, he pointed out emphatically that He (the Spirit of reality, or the Holy Spirit) in verse 17 is I (the Lord) in verse 18. The Lord said in effect, &ldquo;When He comes I come. He is I; I am He.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit is the Lord Jesus, and the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit. Also, in verse 17 the Lord says, &ldquo;The Spirit of reality...shall be in you,&rdquo; and then in verse 20 He says, &ldquo;I in you.&rdquo; This also proves that the Holy Spirit who is in us is the Lord who died and rose and now lives in us.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Lord (the Son) Being the Spirit</h2><p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;And the Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; spoken of here, of course, is the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit. Does this not clearly and definitely tell us that the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit? Our Lord is the Holy Spirit. He is the Father, and He is also the Spirit. He is everything!</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE REASON FOR GOD BEING TRIUNE</h2><p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; Here three things are mentioned: grace, love, and fellowship. This sets forth the reason why God is triune: it is thus that He can dispense Himself into us, work Himself into us for us to enjoy, and be our all. The love of God, that is, the love of the Father, is the source. The grace of Christ, that is, the grace of the Son, is the flowing out of the love of the Father. And the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the flowing into us of the grace of the Son, together with the love of the Father, for us to enjoy. This can be confirmed by our experience. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit within us is the transmitting of the grace of the Son into us. And the grace of the Son within us is simply the practical tasting and enjoying of the love of the Father. The love of the Father is the source, the grace of the Son is the expression, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the transmission, transmitting the grace of the Son, with the love of the Father, into us. The result is that everything that is of the Three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;becomes the enjoyment within us. You have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit within you, and the more you live in this fellowship, the more you will have of the grace of Christ; then, the more you have of the grace of Christ, the more you will enjoy the love of God. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit brings the grace of Christ, and in the grace of Christ there is the love of God. Therefore, the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are not three different things, but three aspects of one thing for us to possess and enjoy. Likewise, the Father, Son, and Spirit are not three Gods but one God with the aspect of three for us to possess and enjoy.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>God is the Triune God. The one, unique God has the aspect of three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all God and are eternal, coexistent, coinherent, and inseparable. To the believers, the Father is the source, the Son is the manifestation, and the Spirit is God reaching and entering into them. Thus, the Triune God is dispensed into their being to be their life, enjoyment, and complete supply.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Give three verses to prove that God is only one.</li><li>Enumerate the Bible passages to explain the matter of God having the aspect of three&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit.</li><li>Cite one verse each to prove that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit all are God.</li><li>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit all are eternal.

Thus, He created all things entirely according to His will and plan. Revelation 4:11 says, &ldquo;You have created all things, and because of Your will they were and have been created.&rdquo; &ldquo;Because&rdquo; in the Greek here means &ldquo;through.&rdquo; All things were created not by chance, nor accidentally, nor casually, but through God&rsquo;s planning. In God&rsquo;s plan, He ordained that through all things He will reach His goal. Therefore, He created all things.</p><h2 class="head1">I. GOD&rsquo;S ORIGINAL CREATION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Purpose</h2><p>Colossians 1:16-18 says, &ldquo;All things have been created through Him and unto Him; and He is before all things, and all things subsist together in Him;...that He might have the first place in all things.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s purpose in creating the universe is entirely for His Son, that His Son may have the preeminence and be glorified in all creation. Not only so, Christ the Son is God&rsquo;s embodiment because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9). Therefore, when the Son is glorified, God is also expressed. God&rsquo;s purpose in creating the universe is that His Son may be glorified and that He Himself may be expressed.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Means</h2><p>In Genesis 1:1 the word &ldquo;created&rdquo; is <em>bara</em> in Hebrew, which means to bring something into existence out of nothing. Therefore, God&rsquo;s original creation was brought into existence out of nothing. How then in God&rsquo;s creation did He create? What was the means through which He created? Hebrews 11:3 says, &ldquo;The universe has been framed by the word of God.&rdquo; John 1:3 also says that all things came into being through the Word of God. God spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast (Psa. 33:9). Therefore, God created the universe out of nothing by His Word. How powerful His Word is!</p><p>On the other hand, the Bible clearly tells us that God created the heavens and the earth by Christ His Son. Hebrews 1:2 says that God made the universe through His Son. Colossians 1:15-16 also says that all things were created in the Son of God. Actually, the Son of God is the Word of God (John 1:1, 14); the Two are one. The Word of God is the explanation of God; the things created through the Word of God are for the explanation of God, the revelation of God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Process</h2><p>Job 38:4-7 reveals the process of God&rsquo;s creation. The heavens with all the hosts and angels therein were created first. The earth, with the living creatures dwelling therein, was created second. Job 38 shows us that when God laid the foundation of the earth, the stars and the angels (the sons of God) were there already. It also shows us that the earth created by God had been measured, with the line stretched upon it; everything was orderly and exceedingly beautiful. Therefore, the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy. Not a shadow of sin nor a trace of confusion could be found in the universe then. It was altogether bright and beautiful. This shows us how bright and beautiful the Creator is.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Creation Proving the Existence of God</h2><p>Psalm 19:1 says, &ldquo;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth His handiwork.&rdquo; Although God&rsquo;s eternal power and divine characteristics are invisible, man can understand them by the things that were made. Man can understand and is therefore without excuse (Rom. 1:20). Hence, by looking at creation, we ought to know that there is a Creator.</p><h2 class="head1">II. GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION AND FURTHER CREATION</h2><p>Genesis 1:2b does not refer to God&rsquo;s original creation&mdash;that was completed with verse 1&mdash;but to God&rsquo;s restoration. God was going to restore what had been damaged, and was going to have some further creation. Verse 2 starts by saying, &ldquo;And the earth became waste and empty&rdquo; (Heb.). &ldquo;And&rdquo; is a conjunction which combines two things: the first thing goes and the second thing comes. This means that after God created, some things happened, causing the harmonious and beautiful universe created originally by God to become damaged. Hence, Genesis 1:2b&mdash;2:25 shows us God&rsquo;s restoration of the damaged universe, plus His further creation.</p><p>Genesis 2:4 says, &ldquo;These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.&rdquo; This verse shows us both God&rsquo;s original creation and God&rsquo;s restoration. The first half of the verse mentions the heavens and the earth when they were created. Notice that the heavens are mentioned first and then the earth, and the verb used here is created. The second half of the verse says that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens. Here, the earth is mentioned first and then the heavens, and the verb has been changed from created to made. As we have pointed out earlier, to create means to produce something out of nothing, and to make means to work upon an existing substance in order to produce something else out of it. Hence, the first half of this verse refers to God&rsquo;s original creation, and the second half refers to God&rsquo;s restoration of the earth and the heavens.</p><p>In Genesis 1:1 God created the heavens and the earth. Then, from verse 3 to the end of chapter one, God made the earth and the heavens. If we read verses 9 and 10, we can see that on the third day God recovered the earth. God did not create the earth, for it was there already, submerged beneath the waters. So God recovered the earth on the third day. Also, on the fourth day, God recovered the sky, that is, the heavens. Thus, in the restoration, it was not firstly the heavens, and then the earth; it was firstly the earth, and then the heavens.</p><h2 class="head2">A. God&rsquo;s Further Creation<br />Being according to the Order of Life</h2><p>In God&rsquo;s further creation, He created all things according to the order of life. First He created the things without life, and then He created the things with life. In the creation of the things with life, He also started from the lowest life, going up level by level, until He reached the highest life. First He created the life without consciousness, that is, the plant life, things such as trees, grass, and flowers. Although these have life, their life has no consciousness; hence, theirs is the lowest life. Then, God created the animal life. He also started from the lowest, the life of the animals that bear eggs, such as fish and birds. Although the life of these creatures has consciousness, it is not high enough. Then, He created the animals that bear their young alive, such as the cattle and the beasts of the earth. These animals that bear their young alive possess a life that is higher than that of the animals that bear eggs. They not only have consciousness, but their consciousness is also higher. Lastly, God created man. Man is the highest life created by God. Man also possesses the highest consciousness among the creatures.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Process</h2><p>The record in Genesis chapter one shows that it took six days for God to do the work of restoration and further creation.</p><p>On the first day, the Spirit of God came to brood. Furthermore, God spoke and there was light. Thus, God separated the light from darkness.</p><p>On the second day, God separated the waters under the expanse from waters above the expanse. This means He separated the heavenly things from the earthly things.</p><p>On the third day, the earth was separated from the waters. God worked on the waters, seeking to confine and limit them, so that the dry land might appear. This is just like what Jeremiah 5:22 says, that God drew a line to limit the sea. After the appearance of the dry land, God went on further to create the different plant lives, each after its kind.</p><p>On the fourth day, God restored the light bearers&mdash;the sun, the moon, and the stars&mdash;to rule over the day and over the night, and also to divide the light from the darkness.</p><p>On the fifth day, God created the living creatures in the water and the birds, the fowl in the air, each after its kind.</p><p>On the sixth day, God created the living creatures on the earth: the cattle, the creeping things, and the beasts, each after its kind. Lastly, God created man to be the center of all things.</p><h2 class="head1">III. IN GOD&rsquo;S CREATION,<br />HUMAN LIFE BEING THE HIGHEST LIFE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Man Being Created according to<br />God&rsquo;s Image and Likeness</h2><p>Man not only possesses the highest created life, but he is also made in God&rsquo;s image and after God&rsquo;s likeness (Gen. 1:26-27). Besides man, no other creature resembles God in image and in likeness. Man is the highest of God&rsquo;s created things, and he is created in God&rsquo;s image and after God&rsquo;s likeness. In God&rsquo;s creation, man is the best container prepared by God for His plan. In His plan God ordained that man would possess His life in order to be the brothers of His Son; therefore, in His creation, He caused man to have His image and likeness.</p><p>Image refers to the inward parts, such as the mind, emotion, and will. Man&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will, which constitute the intangible man, were created in God&rsquo;s image. Therefore, human functions of thought, opinion, and love resemble those of God.</p><p>The image of God also refers to the characteristics of His attributes. The most prominent of God&rsquo;s attributes manifested in man are love, light, holiness, and righteousness. When God created man, He created him in His image, according to the attributes of His virtues, so that man can express Him through these virtues. Thus, man has the desire to have love, light, holiness, and righteousness, and these virtues are sometimes expressed in his behavior. What man has, however, is only the image and not the reality. Man must receive God as his life and content and then God&rsquo;s love, light, holiness, and righteousness will fill up and enrich the human virtues of love, light, holiness, and righteousness to become the reality.</p><p>Likeness refers to the outward body which constitutes the tangible man. Man&rsquo;s outward body was created after the likeness of God. God has His likeness. Before God was incarnated to be a man, He appeared frequently to people in the Old Testament in the form of a man (Gen. 18:2, 16-17; Judg. 13:9-10, 17-19). The form of man is the form of God, for man was created after the likeness of God.</p><h2 class="head3">1. To Have Man to Express God</h2><p>The main purpose of God&rsquo;s restoration and further creation was to have man, a corporate man, to express God (Gen. 1:26-27). The man God created was a corporate man. God did not create many men. God created mankind collectively in one person, Adam. God created Adam, and Adam was a corporate man, a collective man. When Adam was created, we were all created. We were all included in Adam. Therefore, in Genesis 1:26 God said, &ldquo;Let them&rdquo;&mdash;one man, but the pronoun is them. This proves that this man is a corporate man. In this verse, as the pronoun &ldquo;us&rdquo; signifies that God is triune, so the pronoun &ldquo;them&rdquo; signifies that man is corporate. God created such a corporate man in His own image and after His likeness so that man might express God Himself.</p><h2 class="head3">2. To Have Man to Exercise God&rsquo;s Dominion</h2><p>God said, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion.&rdquo; God created a corporate man to exercise His dominion (Gen. 1:26-28). The word dominion includes more than just authority. Dominion means having a kingdom as a sphere in which to exercise authority.</p><h2 class="head4">a. To Deal with God&rsquo;s Enemy</h2><p>The first aspect of God&rsquo;s intention is to deal with His enemy, to deal with Satan, who is typified by the creeping things (Gen. 1:26). In the Bible, creeping things are demonic, devilish, and satanic. The Bible uses a serpent to typify Satan (Gen. 3:1). In Revelation 12:9 Satan is called the &ldquo;ancient serpent.&rdquo;</p><p>In God&rsquo;s original creation, He had only one purpose&mdash;to express Himself. But due to Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, God now has another purpose&mdash;to deal with His enemy. Therefore, He created man in His own image that man might express Him, and He gave him dominion that man might deal with His enemy.</p><h2 class="head4">b. To Recover the Earth</h2><p>The second aspect of God&rsquo;s intention in giving man dominion is to recover the earth (Gen. 1:26-28). Man is to have dominion over the earth, to subdue it, and to conquer it. To conquer the earth means that the enemy is there already, that a war is raging. Therefore, we must fight and conquer.</p><h2 class="head4">c. To Bring In God&rsquo;s Authority</h2><p>The third aspect of God&rsquo;s intention in giving man dominion is to bring in God&rsquo;s authority, to exercise God&rsquo;s authority over the earth. Man must exercise God&rsquo;s authority that the kingdom of God may come to earth, that the will of God may be done on earth, and that the glory of God may be manifested on earth.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Man Being Created in Three Parts&mdash;<br />Spirit, Soul, and Body</h2><p>God created man in three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body. First God formed man&rsquo;s body with the dust of the ground. Then He breathed into man&rsquo;s body the breath of life, which became the spirit in man. When the spirit, the breath of life, entered man&rsquo;s body, the soul was produced. Therefore, outwardly man has the visible body and inwardly man has the invisible spirit; between the two is the soul.</p><p>The body is on the outside to contact the things of the physical world. The spirit is on the inside to contact the things of the spiritual world. The soul, as the medium, is between the body and spirit to contact the things of the psychological world. The body has different sense organs which can contact the material things. The spirit has the functions of the conscience, the intuition, and the fellowship with God, which can contact the things of God and spiritual things. The mind of the soul is man&rsquo;s thinking organ; man thinks and considers&mdash;these are the functions of the mind. The will of the soul is the organ for decision-making; man decides, judges, proposes, chooses, and refuses&mdash;these are the functions of the will. The emotion of the soul is the part that governs man&rsquo;s pleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy; man loves, hates, is excited, is depressed&mdash;these are the functions of the emotion. These three&mdash;mind, will, and emotion&mdash;added together equal the soul.</p><p>The spirit is the deepest part of our whole being, the receiver for us to receive God, and the organ to contact God and all the spiritual things (John 4:24; Rom. 1:9). Within us the sense of our need for God, the sense and understanding of God in our deepest part, and the reproof or approval of our conscience&mdash;these are the functions of the spirit. By the senses of our body we can substantiate the material things; likewise, we can substantiate the things of God and the spiritual things only by the spirit.</p><p>The spirit of man was specifically formed by God (Zech. 12:1; Job 32:8). Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. In the universe are three equally important things: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God. God created the heavens for the earth. Without the heavens, the earth cannot grow anything. The earth was created for the existence of man, and man has a spirit within him to contain God. Thus, man is the center of God&rsquo;s creation and the center of man is his spirit. As far as God is concerned, if there were no spirit within man, man would be an empty shell. If there were no man on this earth, the earth would be void and, as far as man is concerned, the heavens would become meaningless. Therefore, the heavens serve the earth, the earth serves man, and man has a spirit to receive God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Man Being Created Good and Upright</h2><p>Ecclesiastes 7:29 says that God made man upright. When man first came out of God&rsquo;s creating hands, he was not crooked, evil, or defiled, but upright, good, and pure. At that time he had no sin, corruption, or defect. Thus, God considered man &ldquo;very good&rdquo; (Gen. 1:31). Of course, the vessel which the upright and good God had prepared for His holy and shining life cannot be evil or crooked; rather it must be good and upright.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Human Life Being Only a Created Life</h2><p>Although man was created in God&rsquo;s image and after God&rsquo;s likeness, his life is but a created life, unlike God&rsquo;s life which is uncreated. As man is a created being, so man&rsquo;s life is also a created life. Man has a beginning and an end, so man&rsquo;s life also has a beginning and an end, unlike God&rsquo;s life which is without beginning and without end, which is from eternity to eternity. Although man&rsquo;s life is high, it is far inferior to God&rsquo;s life. God&rsquo;s life is eternal; man&rsquo;s life is temporal. God&rsquo;s life is divine and glorious; man&rsquo;s life is, at the most, pure and good, but without God&rsquo;s glorious nature. Although man has the form of God outwardly and the image of God inwardly, he does not have God&rsquo;s life within. Although man has a spirit which enables man to know God and have fellowship with God, man&rsquo;s spirit does not have God&rsquo;s life nor God&rsquo;s nature. Man is only a creature of God, but he does not have the uncreated life of God within.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. GOD PLACING MAN IN FRONT OF THE TREE OF LIFE<br />IN ORDER FOR MAN TO RECEIVE HIM AS LIFE</h2><p>After God created man, He did not put the divine life into man. Instead, He gave man a free will; He wanted man to exercise the free will to choose, to take in His life. Therefore, He placed man in front of the tree of life.</p><p>In order to give man an opportunity to choose, God put the tree of knowledge of good and evil beside the tree of life. The tree of life denotes God as the source of life; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of death. These two trees signify the two sources in the universe. Many people think that if God had not allowed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil to stay beside the tree of life, then there would have been no problem afterwards. However, God did not do it that way. He is great. He is so attractive as the God of glory. He did not compel man to choose Him. Instead, He allowed man to exercise his free will to choose what he thought was good. It was according to such a principle that, in the garden of Eden, God put Adam in front of two trees; He wanted man to choose Him, to take Him as life.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, the universe. Later because Satan rebelled, the heavens and the earth were corrupted and thus judged by God. Then God recovered the heavens and the earth that He had judged and took a further step in creation. In this further step of creation, He made man especially in His own image, specifically creating a spirit in man so that man could contact Him, receive Him as his life and content, be brought into an organic union with Him, and become one with Him.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>What were the purpose and means of God&rsquo;s original creation?</li><li>Why did God need to restore the original created universe and to have a further creation?</li><li>How long did God spend in His work of restoration and further creation?

This was the result of God&rsquo;s judgment on the earth due to Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. Now let us look at Satan&rsquo;s origin and rebellion.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE ORIGIN OF SATAN</h2><p>Satan means adversary. Satan is not only God&rsquo;s enemy outside of God&rsquo;s kingdom, but also God&rsquo;s adversary from within God&rsquo;s kingdom, rebelling against God. Enemy refers to the foe outside of God&rsquo;s kingdom, whereas adversary refers to the foe from within God&rsquo;s kingdom. Satan, who had been under God&rsquo;s ruling, is not an outsider. Therefore, he has been God&rsquo;s adversary right up to now.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Most Honorable Archangel<br />and the Perfect Cherub Created by God</h2><p>Satan was an angel created by God before God created the earth. The book of Job tells us that when God laid the foundation of the earth, the sons of God (the angels) shouted for joy (Job 38:4-7). This proves that God created the angels before He created the earth. From Ezekiel 28 we see that Satan was not only one of the angels, but the highest archangel, the head of all the angels.</p><p>Ezekiel 28:12-14 says, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord God; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.&rdquo;</p> <p>This portion of the Scriptures describes Satan&rsquo;s position in the universe before his rebellion and corruption. Verse 13 says, &ldquo;Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God.&rdquo; According to the context, this was not the Eden in which Adam was placed. This Eden was not on the earth, but in the heavens, on the holy mountain of God.</p><p>&ldquo;Every precious stone was thy covering.&rdquo; G. H. Pember said that this indicates Satan&rsquo;s dwelling place. His dwelling was of precious stones. &ldquo;The workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.&rdquo; In the ancient times, musical instruments such as tambourines and pipes were for kings. This indicates that Satan was a king, holding the highest position in the universe. This was why even the Lord Jesus called him &ldquo;the ruler of this world&rdquo; (John 12:31). The apostle also called him &ldquo;the ruler of the authority of the air&rdquo; (Eph. 2:2). Luke 4:5-6 also confirms this. &ldquo;He [the Devil] led Him [Jesus] up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in a moment of time. And the Devil said to Him, To You I will give all this authority and their glory, because to me it has been delivered, and to whomever I want I give it.&rdquo; This must be a fact, since the Lord did not deny it. When did God deliver all of this to Satan? This was definitely something pre-Adamic, before the world of Adam. According to the revelation of the Bible, God appointed Satan the head of that universe, and God delivered all created things in the heaven and on the earth into his hand. So he became the ruler of this world. His position and rank were so high that even Michael the archangel did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him (Jude 9). Michael was one of the archangels (Dan. 10:13). His daring not to rebuke Satan proves that Satan&rsquo;s rank must be even higher than his. Thus, we can infer that Satan must be the highest archangel.</p><p>Ezekiel 28:14 says, &ldquo;Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth.&rdquo; This probably means that he covered the ark of God in the heavens (Exo. 25:20; Rev. 11:19). It also says, &ldquo;And I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God.&rdquo; Thus, we can see that his position was ordained by God. God anointed and appointed the archangel to cover His ark. Ezekiel tells us that the cherubim bear God&rsquo;s glory (Ezek. 9:3; 10:18) and that they are very close to God&rsquo;s throne (Ezek. 10:1; 1:26). This shows that Satan, before his rebellion, when he was the anointed cherub covering God&rsquo;s ark, must have been very close to God, bearing God&rsquo;s glory. Ezekiel also tells us that the cherubim are the four living creatures which are of special use to God (Ezek. 10:20). Also the four living creatures in Ezekiel are similar to the four in Revelation (Ezek. 1:10; Rev. 4:7) which took the lead among the creatures in worshipping God. This reveals that today&rsquo;s Satan, God&rsquo;s adversary, originally the anointed cherub, must have been specially appointed by God to be the head among His creatures, bearing His glory and leading them to worship Him. This may indicate that the anointed archangel also had the priesthood. He might have been the high priest in the universal worship of God.</p><p>&ldquo;Thou wast upon the holy mountain of God...Thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.&rdquo; According to Exodus 24:10 and 17 Moses, Aaron, and many others saw under God&rsquo;s throne some precious stones with the glory of God like burning fire. Those must be the stones of fire. From this we may infer that the anointed cherub was also specially privileged to move in the realm where God&rsquo;s glory was.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Bright Angel Created by God</h2><p>Isaiah 14:12 tells us that Satan was the &ldquo;Daystar [for Lucifer, according to Latin], son of the morning.&rdquo; Just as the daystar is the leading one among the stars, so Satan must be the head of all the angels. The title &ldquo;son of the morning&rdquo; shows that he was there early, in the morning of the universe. Thus Satan, from the earliest days of the universe, was the head of the angels, bright as the daystar.</p><p>Satan&rsquo;s origin was wonderful. He was God&rsquo;s anointed cherub, the one closest to God, holding the highest position in God&rsquo;s creation. He had not only the kingship, but also the priesthood. But he was deprived of his position and offices when he rebelled against God. Now God has chosen us to be His priests and kings, to take over Satan&rsquo;s position and offices, to put him to shame, and to glorify God.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE REBELLION OF SATAN</h2><p>Ezekiel 28:15 says that Satan was perfect in his ways from the day he was created. Of course, God did not create an evil Satan. God created a good and perfect archangel. But at a certain time, this archangel, the anointed cherub, rebelled against God.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Cause of Rebellion</h2><p>Satan rebelled against God because of pride in his heart. Ezekiel 28:17 says that his heart was lifted up because of his beauty, that he corrupted his wisdom by reason of his brightness. He &ldquo;sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty&rdquo; (Ezek. 28:12). This means that he had the full measure of completeness and was short of nothing. But he gazed on his beauty and was proud. He looked at his brightness, and because of his brightness he used his God-given wisdom to commit sins and do unrighteous deeds, and thus corrupted his wisdom. To look at what God has made us and to forget God Himself always tempts us to be proud. Pride was the cause of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. In our experience, all the natural virtues and spiritual gifts can be utilized by the Devil to make us proud. Even the Apostle Paul could &ldquo;be exceedingly lifted up by the transcendence of the revelations&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:7). The proud Devil is still walking about on the earth, seeking the proud ones whom he may devour (1 Pet. 5:8). The only way to resist him is to humble ourselves. &ldquo;Gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:5). The Lord Jesus is a good example in this matter. Satan exalted himself, but the Lord Jesus &ldquo;humbled Himself&rdquo; (Phil. 2:8). Thus, the Lord Jesus overcame Satan, and Satan had nothing in Him (John 14:30).</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Purpose of Rebellion</h2><p>The purpose of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion was to exalt himself to be equal with God. In Isaiah 14:13-14 we find that five times Satan said, &ldquo;I will&rdquo;: &ldquo;I will ascend into heaven...I will exalt my throne...I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation...I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.&rdquo; Satan wanted to be equal with God. That was the purpose of his rebellion against God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Process of Rebellion</h2><p>Satan initiated the rebellion against God with the evil intention to overthrow God&rsquo;s authority (Ezek. 28:15-18; Isa. 14:13-14). Not only did he rebel, but a great part of the angels who were under his hand also rebelled. In Revelation 12:4 and 9 we see that one-third of the heavenly stars, that is, one-third of the angels, followed him. (In Revelation stars represent angels.) In Matthew 25:41 the Lord Jesus refers to &ldquo;the Devil and his angels.&rdquo; Ephesians 2:2 describes Satan as &ldquo;the ruler of the authority of the air,&rdquo; and Ephesians 6:12 tells us of &ldquo;the rulers...the authorities...in the heavenlies.&rdquo; These rulers and authorities were the angels under Satan&rsquo;s hand, ruling over the pre-Adamic universe. When Satan rebelled against God, most of his angels followed him in his rebellion, becoming the fallen angels, the evil spirits. Today, in the universe there are two categories of angels, good angels and evil angels. The good angels stand with God; the evil ones are allied with Satan against God.</p><p>The living creatures which were on the earth at that time also joined Satan in his rebellion. Thus God judged them with water and they became the demons on the earth. Their lodging place is in the water. Man&rsquo;s body is also their temporary dwelling place. Matthew 12:43 says, &ldquo;Now when the unclean spirit goes out from a man, it passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it.&rdquo; This shows that the lodging place of the demons is in the water. If they cannot find water, they make the physical body of a human being their temporary dwelling place (Matt. 12:44-45).</p><p>Why do demons like to get into water or into a human body? In his book, <em>Earth&rsquo;s Earliest Ages,</em> G. H. Pember has made a scholarly and thorough study of this matter. Geologists and archaeologists have discovered that the earth is not merely six thousand years old, but much older. Some have discovered fossil remains of bones which are thousands and thousands of years old. But according to the Bible, there are only about six thousand years from Adam to now. Mr. Pember found the answer. Between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2 there was a period of time which he called the interval. No one can say how long this interval was. At any rate, it must have been a very long period of time. After studying this matter thoroughly, Pember inferred that at a certain time after the original creation, Satan and his angels rebelled. Pember also inferred from the biblical record that in this pre-Adamic age there existed on the earth some living beings and that they also joined Satan in his rebellion against God. Thus Satan, his fallen angels, and these living beings were all judged by God. After they were judged by God, these beings lost their bodies and became disembodied spirits. This is the reason that demons want to enter a physical body. The water with which God judged them became the deep where the demons must live. Pember even proved that under this deep water there is the so-called abyss. The deep water is the demons&rsquo; dwelling place.</p><p>One day, while the Lord Jesus was sailing across the sea, a strong wind blew and a great storm arose. He commanded the wind to stop and the storm to be silent (Matt. 8:23-27). Why did the air become windy and the water stormy? Because there were the fallen angels in the air and demons in the water. They knew that the Lord Jesus was going over to the other shore to cast out demons (Matt. 8:28-32). Thus they raised up the wind and the storm to frustrate His coming.</p><p>In the pre-Adamic age, the evil angels and the living beings followed Satan in his rebellion against God to form the kingdom of Satan. Its sphere is the so-called world including the earth and the air. Today, in Satan&rsquo;s kingdom there are the fallen angels in the air, the demons in the water, and the fallen human beings on the earth.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE RESULT OF REBELLION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Satan Being Judged by God</h2><p>Satan&rsquo;s rebellion brought in God&rsquo;s judgment. God cannot tolerate any rebellion among His creatures. Immediately after Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, God declared His judgment on him. &ldquo;Iniquity was found in thee. By the multitude of thy slander [According to the root of the Hebrew word, here &#145;merchandise&rsquo; can be translated &#145;slander&rsquo;]...thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up...thou hast corrupted thy wisdom...I will cast thee to the ground...Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities...&rdquo; (Ezek. 28:15-18). &ldquo;Thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit&rdquo; (Isa. 14:15).</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Heavens and the Earth Being Judged</h2><p>The heavens and the earth surely were defiled by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. God rebuked Satan, &ldquo;Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries.&rdquo; Therefore, the heavens and the earth were also judged by God. Job 9:5-7 says that God overturned the mountain in His anger, shook the earth out of its place, commanded the sun not to rise, and sealed the stars. We cannot find a record of such an event in human history. It must have happened before the Adamic world, at the time God judged the heavens and the earth due to the rebellion of Satan and his followers. Because of God&rsquo;s judgment, the heavens did not shine. The earth was covered by darkness. God judged the earth by flooding it with water. So, &ldquo;the earth became waste and empty,&rdquo; buried under deep water, and covered with darkness (Gen. 1:2).</p><p>Isaiah 45:18 says, &ldquo;God created the earth not a waste&rdquo; (ASV). Job 38:4-7 also says that God &ldquo;laid the foundations of the earth,&rdquo; &ldquo;laid the measures thereof,&rdquo; and &ldquo;stretched the line upon it;&rdquo; then &ldquo;the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.&rdquo; This means that He created everything in good order. So when the morning stars saw it, they were excited and sang, and when all the angels saw it, they shouted for joy. It must have happened in Genesis 1:1, not in Genesis 1:2. How could the morning stars sing and the angels shout for joy when the earth became waste and empty?</p><p>Whenever these two words &ldquo;waste&rdquo; and &ldquo;empty&rdquo; are used together in the Old Testament, they always denote a result of judgment (Jer. 4:23; Isa. 34:8-11). Whatever has been judged by God becomes waste and empty. The earth became empty and waste because it was judged by God.</p><p>The darkness which was upon the surface of the deep was also a sign showing that the universe of that age was judged, because darkness comes from God&rsquo;s judgment (Exo. 10:21-22; Rev. 16:10).</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Rebellious Angels<br />and the Demons Being Judged</h2><p>When God judged Satan and the universe under him, God also must have judged both the angels who followed him and the living beings on the earth during that age who joined him in his rebellion. After being judged, the rebellious angels became the spiritual forces of evil in the air (Eph. 6:12), and the living beings became disembodied spirits, the demons, lodging in the water with which they were judged.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE EXECUTION OF GOD&rsquo;S JUDGMENT UPON SATAN</h2><p>Though Satan, the rebellious angels, and the demons were all judged by God, they are still moving and working today, because the judgment upon them has not yet been executed.</p><p>Today, Satan can still go to God to accuse God&rsquo;s people (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7; Rev. 12:10). He still &ldquo;walks about&rdquo; on the earth &ldquo;seeking someone to devour&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:8), and still works to blind the thoughts of people (2 Cor. 4:4), to deceive them by transfiguring himself into an angel of light (2 Cor. 11:14). We must not be ignorant of his thoughts (2 Cor. 2:11), neither give place to the Devil (Eph. 4:27). We must withstand him firm in the faith (1 Pet. 5:8-9). We need to put on the whole armor of God that we may be able to stand against him (Eph. 6:11-17).</p><p>After Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, God pronounced His judgment upon him immediately. But it takes a long time to execute God&rsquo;s judgment. The Lord Jesus was manifested in the flesh that He might destroy the works of the Devil (1 John 3:8). This was the execution of God&rsquo;s judgment. The Lord gave His disciples authority over all the power of the enemy (Luke 10:19). When the disciples cast out demons, Satan fell from heaven (Luke 10:17-20). Through His death on the cross, He destroyed the Devil (Heb. 2:14). He has bruised the head of the old serpent. Now we, as His Body, must continue this execution, to destroy the tail of the serpent. Through the church&rsquo;s executing work, the Devil will be cast to the earth, and his angels will be cast out with him (Rev. 12:9). He will later be bound and cast into the abyss (Rev. 20:2-3). Eventually, he will be &ldquo;cast into the lake of fire&rdquo; (Rev. 20:10). Then, the execution of God&rsquo;s judgment upon Satan and his followers will be completed.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>Satan was originally the highest of the archangels created by God. He rebelled against God because of pride and became God&rsquo;s adversary, God&rsquo;s enemy. The heavens, the earth, and the universe were corrupted because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and fell under God&rsquo;s judgment. God&rsquo;s judgment on Satan is being carried out gradually until Christ comes again, when he will be bound and cast into the abyss for one thousand years. At the end of the one thousand years, he will be released from the abyss and will rebel for the last time. Immediately after this rebellion, he will be cast into the lake of fire to be punished for eternity. Thus, God&rsquo;s judgment on Satan will be completed.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>What is the meaning of the name Satan?

But before man could contact the tree of life and join with God in life, Satan took the opportunity to come first. He tempted man to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and caused man to have an illegal union with him. This became the first step of man&rsquo;s fall.</p><p>According to the record in Genesis 3 through 11, mankind had four steps of the fall. The first step is the fall of Adam, which is recorded in chapter three; the second is the fall of Cain, recorded in chapter four; the third is the fall of the crooked and perverse generation before the deluge, recorded in chapter six; and the fourth is the fall of the whole human race rising up collectively to rebel against God, which is recorded in chapter eleven. These four steps of the fall continued one after another. In these four steps, Satan&rsquo;s subtlety was exposed to the uttermost.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE FIRST STEP OF THE FALL</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Cause</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Serpent&rsquo;s Temptation</h2><p>If the serpent had not come to deceive and tempt man, man would not have fallen. The tempting serpent is the incarnation of Satan. The evil one was crafty; he came in stealthily. Instead of coming in openly, he hid himself in the subtle serpent to tempt man. Thus, Revelation 12:9 says that Satan (the ancient serpent) deceives the whole inhabited earth.</p><p>The way Satan tempts is to ask man questions (Gen. 3:1, 4) causing man to doubt God&rsquo;s word. God clearly commanded man, saying, &ldquo;But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die&rdquo; (Gen. 2:17). But Satan said to the woman, &ldquo;Hath God said?&rdquo; Again, he said, &ldquo;Ye shall not surely die.&rdquo; After Eve received Satan&rsquo;s proposal, she began to doubt God&rsquo;s word. Thus, she took of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and ate. Even to this day, Satan still uses the same method to tempt man into sin or to instigate him to reject God&rsquo;s salvation. However, the Bible tells us that heaven and earth shall pass away, but the Lord&rsquo;s words shall by no means pass away (Luke 21:33). The Lord&rsquo;s word is not yes and no (2 Cor. 1:18).</p><p>The proposal made by the serpent also caused man to doubt God&rsquo;s heart. The serpent said to the woman, &ldquo;For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil&rdquo; (Gen. 3:5). The serpent wanted man to think that God was trying to deceive him when He prohibited man from eating the tree of knowledge because He was afraid that man would be like Him in knowing good and evil. This is also one of Satan&rsquo;s most frequently used malicious stratagems. Today man is far from God and not willing to come to God&rsquo;s presence, because he has been deceived by Satan. Thus, he misunderstands the love of God and does not know God&rsquo;s heart.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Woman&rsquo;s Assuming the Headship</h2><p>Another cause of man&rsquo;s fall was the woman&rsquo;s assuming the headship (Gen. 3:2-3, 6). Originally, God created only one man. There was only one head, not two. Adam was the head; Eve was not. Eve was built out of the rib from Adam&rsquo;s side (Gen. 2:22). Eve&rsquo;s head was Adam. The reason Eve was tempted by the serpent was that she assumed the headship, made the decision on her own, and fell into Satan&rsquo;s snare. Even before she ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, she was already ensnared by the evil one. She passed over the man and assumed the headship to deal with the situation. This resulted in her being deceived. Thus, the Bible says that Adam was not deceived, but the woman being quite deceived was in transgression (1 Tim. 2:14).</p><p>Here we see a great principle. In the universe the unique Head is God Himself. Whenever we assume the headship in dealing with any situation, denying the headship of God and of Christ, we will surely be deceived.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Process</h2><p>The first step in the process of the fall was man&rsquo;s failure to use his spirit. After man was created, he ought to have always used his spirit to contact God and live before Him. When man lives according to the spirit, he is preserved by God. But whenever man does not use his spirit to contact God, he bypasses God and puts God aside; consequently, he falls into the hand of the evil one.</p><p>The second step was the exercising of the soul (Gen. 3:2, 3, 6). When Eve spoke to the serpent, she firstly reasoned in her mind. Then she was tempted in her emotion and desired the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Eventually, she decided in her will to take the fruit and eat it.</p><p>The third step was the action of the body. When the soul is exercised, the body will naturally follow. The soul directs the body. When she was tempted this way, surely she would take and eat. Her taking the fruit to eat was the action of the body. First, the eye sees. Second, the hand takes. Third, the mouth eats.</p><p>In our daily living, we should use our spirit first, and then let our spirit direct our soul, which, in turn, directs our body. If we do not use our spirit but use our soul instead, we assume the headship and our soul takes the lead. Once the soul takes the lead, it will direct the body to do things that offend God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Result</h2><p>The first result of the fall was that the soul was polluted, corrupted, and occupied. Even before Eve partook of the tree of knowledge, her mind had been polluted already. While she was talking to the serpent, the serpent&rsquo;s concept penetrated her mind and defiled it. Hence, her mind was corrupted. Eventually, her mind was fully occupied by the evil one after she ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p><p>The second result was that the body was changed in nature, having the element of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the element of Satan, added to it, making it the flesh (Gen. 3:7). The human body originally created by God was pure. However, it now contains the evil element of Satan. This evil element is the indwelling sin which makes its home in man&rsquo;s flesh. In Romans 7:17 Paul says, &ldquo;So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.&rdquo; This evil substance, the nature of sin, has contaminated our body, making it flesh, full of evil and lust.</p><p>The third result was that man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened, becoming insulated from God and losing its function toward God. Ephesians 2:5 tells us that before we were saved we were dead. We were not dead in our body or in our soul, but in our spirit. To be dead is to be without function or sensation. When man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened, man no longer possessed the ability to contact God and fellowship with Him.</p><p>The fourth result was that the fallen man was constituted a sinner (Rom. 5:19). Due to man&rsquo;s fall, a certain element has been injected into man, an element which the Bible calls sin. Romans 5:12 says, &ldquo;As through one man sin entered into the world.&rdquo; Thus, we all have been constituted sinners. Sin has already entered into us and become our subjective element within. Hence, we are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we have been constituted sinners.</p><p>The fifth result was that the fallen man was condemned (Rom. 5:18). We were all in Adam. The condemnation includes not only Adam but also the entire human race. The entire human race was condemned in Adam.</p><p>The sixth result was that the curse was brought in (Gen. 3:17-19). Because of one man&rsquo;s sin, all of creation is subjected to vanity, groaning and travailing under the slavery of corruption (Rom. 8:20). The earth was cursed and it brought forth thorns and thistles. Furthermore, by the sweat of his face man will eat bread throughout his lifetime. These are the items of the curse brought in through man&rsquo;s fall.</p><p>The seventh result was that man was cast out of paradise (Gen. 3:23-24). Paradise was the realm of life which included the tree of life and the sphere in which man may receive life. Thus, to be cast out of paradise means to be driven away from the sphere of life.</p><p>The eighth result was death (Gen. 3:19; Rom. 5:12). First, man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened, and eventually his body will die. Through Adam&rsquo;s transgression sin entered into the world and death through sin. Death reigns over all men (Rom. 5:14). Thus, in Adam all die (1 Cor. 15:22).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SECOND STEP OF THE FALL</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Background</h2><p>After Adam and Eve sinned, they hid themselves from the presence of God. But God came to seek them and promised that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15). When Adam heard this, he immediately called his wife Eve (Gen. 3:20). Eve means &ldquo;Living.&rdquo; This proves that Adam believed God&rsquo;s promise and received God&rsquo;s gospel. Then, Genesis 4:1 says, &ldquo;And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have acquired a man, Jehovah&rdquo; (Heb.). Cain means &ldquo;acquired.&rdquo; When Eve gave birth to Cain, she declared, &ldquo;I have obtained it!&rdquo; According to Eve&rsquo;s concept, Cain was the seed of woman promised in Genesis 3:15. Her words in Genesis 4:1 prove that she believed that promise and received the gospel of God.</p><p>With such a background, man should have obtained God&rsquo;s salvation by God&rsquo;s mercy. Yet, how pitiful it is that man fell again.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Cause</h2><p>Genesis 4 shows us two kinds of examples. Abel was an example of believing the gospel and living for the gospel, while Cain was an example of turning from God&rsquo;s way of salvation. The latter brought about the second step of the fall.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Devil&rsquo;s Gain</h2><p>One reason for Cain&rsquo;s continuing the fall was that the Devil had gained him inwardly. At the time of Genesis 4, Satan had already entered into man&rsquo;s body. Hence, in man&rsquo;s second fall, apparently it was Cain who rejected God&rsquo;s glad tidings; actually it was Satan who kept him from God&rsquo;s way of salvation and even caused him to fall further. Thus, the second step of man&rsquo;s fall was instigated by the subtle one who had gained Cain and worked within him.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Man&rsquo;s Presumption<br />in Forsaking God&rsquo;s Way of Salvation</h2><p>God had shown man His way of salvation&mdash;to clothe him with the skins of sacrificial lambs (Gen. 3:21). However, Cain was presumptuous in that he forsook God&rsquo;s way of salvation. He followed Satan and put aside God&rsquo;s salvation. This was the cause of man&rsquo;s further fall.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Process</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Serving God according to Man&rsquo;s Own Way&mdash; Inventing a Religion of Man&rsquo;s Concept</h2><p>&ldquo;Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect&rdquo; (Gen. 4:3-5). Both presented offerings to God. One offered according to his own opinion and the other offered according to God&rsquo;s concept. Abel followed the way of God&rsquo;s salvation to offer a sacrifice as his substitute by the shedding of blood. But Cain rejected God&rsquo;s way in his service and offering; he invented a religion of man&rsquo;s concept, according to his own ideas.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Man&rsquo;s Anger</h2><p>When he learned that God did not look upon his offering, &ldquo;Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell&rdquo; (Gen. 4:5). This is the result of serving God according to his own concept.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Man&rsquo;s Murder of His Brother</h2><p>&ldquo;And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him&rdquo; (Gen. 4:8). Cain began by serving God, then continued by being angry, and finally ended by killing. No wonder the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;An hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think that he is offering service to God&rdquo; (John 16:2). The question is not whether we serve God or we commit sin, but whether we act according to God&rsquo;s way or according to our own opinion. We should not give any room to our concepts in all things that we do.</p> <h2 class="head3">4. Man&rsquo;s Lie and Arrogance toward God</h2><p>&ldquo;And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo; (Gen. 4:9). Cain&rsquo;s answer to God was not only a lie, but it also showed how arrogant he was. Man was somewhat afraid of God after the first step of the fall. But here man dared to display his arrogance toward God.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Result</h2><p>As a result of the second step of the fall, God pronounced a greater curse: man would till the ground, but the ground would not yield to him her strength. Furthermore, he will become a vagabond wandering on the earth, and he was cast out of the presence of God, unable to see God&rsquo;s face (Gen. 4:11-12, 14).</p><p>Eventually Cain and his descendants invented a culture without God. This culture included building a city for self-existence, inventing cattle-raising for making a living, inventing music for amusement, and inventing weapons for defense (Gen. 4:17, 20-22). The further man drifts away from God, the less he has His presence. Having lost God, man was forced to invent a godless culture. This is the result of the fall of man.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE THIRD STEP OF THE FALL</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Cause</h2><p>In the first step of the fall, the enemy of God was outside of man. In the second step of the fall, this enemy was inside of man. Now, the enemy took another step, causing man to fall even further.</p><p></P><h2 class="head3">1. The Evil Spirits Mingling with Man&mdash;<br />the Fallen Angels Joining with Man<br />through Illegal Marriage</h2><p>Genesis 6 tells us that the sons of God married the daughters of men. Here the sons of God were the angels. In Job 1:6 and 2:1 we are told that the angels are called the sons of God. Also, the Syriac Version of the Old Testament renders &ldquo;the sons of God&rdquo; as &ldquo;the angels&rdquo; in Genesis 6. The angels that married the daughters of men were those who did not keep their principality, as recorded in Jude 6 and 7. Some of the fallen angels under Satan came down to the earth and took human bodies. They formed illegal marriages with the daughters of men. They committed fornication through the bodies of men, so that the human race was no longer pure but became a mixture of human nature with the fallen spirits. Hence, God decided to send the flood to exterminate the human race.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Man Becoming Flesh</h2><p>Genesis 6:3 says, &ldquo;And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for that he indeed is flesh&rdquo; (Heb.). In the first step of the fall, man did not exercise his spirit. In the second step of the fall, man followed his own will and lived by his soul. In the third step of the fall, man abused the fallen body and became flesh. Romans 7 and 8 reveal to us that the flesh is thoroughly and absolutely hated by God. God will not tolerate it. Therefore, when the entire human race became flesh, God came in and told His servant Noah that He was going to destroy that whole generation together with the earth (Gen. 6:11-13).</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Process</h2><p>The first step was the fulfilling of the lusts of the flesh. Man lived and indulged in lusts, and every imagination of his thoughts was evil continually (Gen. 6:5). The second step was that man was not only evil, but corrupt to such a degree that even the most tolerant God could not tolerate it any longer (Gen. 6:11-13).</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Result</h2><p>First, the Holy Spirit withdrew Himself. The Lord said, &ldquo;My Spirit shall not strive with man forever&rdquo; (Gen. 6:3). Before that time although man had fallen, God&rsquo;s Spirit was continually striving with man and moving in man. Nevertheless, at this point God could not do anything further. When man had become flesh, the Spirit of God had to withdraw. Man was completely separated from God and forsaken by God. Second, the deluge brought in the judgment of destruction. With the exception of Noah and those in the ark with him, all were exterminated by the flood.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE FOURTH STEP OF THE FALL</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Cause</h2><p>There are two factors in each step of the fall. The first factor is Satan, and the second is man.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Instigation of Satan</h2><p>Before the flood there was no human government. It was only after the flood that God established a deputy authority on the earth. Man began to exercise God&rsquo;s authority to rule over others. At the fourth step of the fall, Satan utilized the authority which God gave man to form the nations and to instigate a rebellion against God with the nations. Hence, man fell into an open rebellion against God collectively.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Rebellion of the Human Race</h2><p>Rebellion is the denial of right and authority. In the rebellion at Babel, man declared that he denied God&rsquo;s right and that he was absolutely free from God&rsquo;s authority. The entire human race was stirred up, having been instigated into rebellion, to declare that they did not care for God&rsquo;s right or for God&rsquo;s authority.</p><p>At his fall in the beginning, Satan&rsquo;s intention was to overthrow God&rsquo;s authority, but he was not successful in his attempt. Hence, he came again into the fallen human race to inject the same thought into man, inciting man to rise up collectively against God&rsquo;s authority.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Process</h2><p>The first step was the conspiracy to rebel against God (Gen. 11:3-4). The created men who were under God&rsquo;s ruling came together to conspire to rebel against God. The second step was the making of bricks with the earth by human labor. According to the whole revelation of the Bible, God&rsquo;s building has never been with any kind of bricks. God&rsquo;s building is with stones. Man built the tower of Babel with bricks instead of stones. This means that man uses the misused earth plus human labor to replace God&rsquo;s work. The third step was the building of a city to have a man-made, godless life. A city is the center of human living; hence, it represents human living. The city built with bricks signifies a man-made human life, which is a godless life. The fourth step was the building of a tower to declare the renouncing of God. The tower of Babel was a mark and an announcement of the city of Babel. It declared that the people there lived a life rejecting God and His authority. The final step was that they made a name to deny God&rsquo;s name, that is, to deny God Himself.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Result</h2><p>First, God came in to scatter them. Since they rebelled against God collectively, God came in to scatter them that they might no longer live together in one place. Second, God confounded their language so that they were no longer able to have the same language. Third, confusion was brought in. Babel means &ldquo;confusion.&rdquo; This is due to the curse and judgment.</p><p>When man reached the fourth step of the fall, he had fallen to the uttermost, so that even God could not do anything to recover the fallen race. Eventually, God was forced to give up the race of Adam and had to call Abraham as the head of a new race for the fulfilling of His purpose in man.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>The man created by God was very good and without sin, but he was deceived by God&rsquo;s enemy, the Devil, to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; thus, he fell and became a sinner. On the one hand, he had sinned before God, and on the other hand, he now had the sinful nature, Satan&rsquo;s evil nature, within him. The fallen nature of man caused his descendants to fall again and again until they reached the point of rebelling against God and standing against Him. At this stage, man was utterly fallen and met with God&rsquo;s rejection.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>What were the cause and the result of the first step of man&rsquo;s fall?</li><li>What were the cause and the result of the second step of man&rsquo;s fall?</li><li>What were the cause and the result of the third step of man&rsquo;s fall?</li><li>What were the cause and the result of the fourth step of man&rsquo;s fall?</li><li>When did sin enter into man?

GOD&rsquo;S PLAN OF REDEMPTION</h2><p>In His eternal plan, God planned to create all things and to have man to fulfill His eternal purpose. Furthermore, according to His foreknowledge and foresight, that is, according to His foreknowledge of man&rsquo;s fall, He planned to redeem man after the fall. God&rsquo;s redemption was neither an addition to His original plan, nor an afterthought to remedy the problem, but was planned and prepared from the beginning. In God&rsquo;s eternal plan, He foreordained that after man&rsquo;s fall, Christ would accomplish redemption. Therefore in God&rsquo;s view, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8).</p><h2 class="head1">II. GOD&rsquo;S PROMISE OF REDEMPTION</h2><p>Redemption was planned beforehand and foreordained by God. Hence, before redemption came, in the Old Testament God promised it many times, clearly foretelling the different aspects of His redemption.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Seed of the Woman</h2><p>After man sinned and fell, God came in immediately to promise man that the seed of the woman would come. When He would come, He would bruise Satan&rsquo;s head (Gen. 3:15). To bruise his head is to cause his death.</p><p>The seed of the woman is the Lord Jesus. Among the entire human race, only He was come of a woman (Gal. 4:4). He came to earth to undo the works of the Devil (1 John 3:8), that through death He might destroy the Devil (Heb. 2:14).</p><p>Therefore, at the time of man&rsquo;s fall, God promised that Christ would come of a woman to destroy Satan, the one who deceived and damaged man.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Seed of Abraham</h2><p>Christ is not only the seed of the woman, but also the seed of Abraham (Gen. 13:15; 17:8; Gal. 3:16), as typified by Isaac. First, He brings blessings to the nations. Whether Jews or Gentiles, all will be blessed in Him (Gen. 22:18a). The blessing is the Spirit. Through faith in Christ, we have received the Spirit (Gal. 3:14). Second, He was offered to God, put to death, and resurrected (cf. Gen. 22:1-12; Heb. 11:17, 19). Third, He will gain the bride (cf. Gen. 24:67). This portrays Christ, as the One promised by God, bringing blessings to the nations, being offered even unto death, and being resurrected. After resurrection, He gains those whom He redeemed to be His bride (John 3:29; Rev. 19:7).</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Lion of the Tribe of Judah</h2><p>In Genesis 49:8 and 9, God promised that the coming Christ would be the victorious lion. &ldquo;Judah is a young lion: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up&rdquo; (Heb.). This is a picture portraying Christ (Rev. 5:5). When Christ was crucified on the cross, He was a young lion seizing the prey. The prey He seized on the cross includes the entire world, all the sinners, and even Satan. After taking His prey, He went up to the mountain, that is, He ascended to the third heaven. Ephesians 4:8 says, &ldquo;Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He couches, He lies down as a lion&rdquo; (Gen. 49:9b, Heb.). This indicates that Christ is also a couching lion who, after enjoying his prey, is satisfied and lies down. This portrays Christ in the heavens, enjoying what He has accomplished. The same verse also likens Christ to a lioness. He has brought us forth as His many cubs.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Seed of David</h2><p>Second Samuel 7:12 and 13 say, &ldquo;I will set up thy [David&rsquo;s] seed after thee....He shall build a house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.&rdquo; The promise includes three points. First, Christ as the seed of David (Rom. 1:3) will inherit the kingdom, and reign forever and ever (Rev. 11:15). Second, Christ is the greater Solomon who speaks the word of wisdom (Matt. 12:42); no one else can speak as wisely as Christ. Third, Solomon, the son of David, built the temple of God; Christ, as the seed of David, builds the temple of God&mdash;the church.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Concerning the Birth of Christ</h2><h2 class="head3">1. A Virgin Conceiving and Bearing a Son</h2><p>In Isaiah 7:14, God more clearly reveals the promise of His redemption. On the one hand, it tells us that the coming Christ, as promised in Genesis 3, was not to be born of a married woman but of a virgin. On the other hand, it also tells us that this Christ who was to be born of a virgin to be our Savior is God. He is &ldquo;God with us,&rdquo; &ldquo;Emmanuel.&rdquo; When He comes into the midst of men, God comes into the midst of men. When He comes to be man&rsquo;s Savior, God comes to be man&rsquo;s Savior; God Himself comes of a virgin to be man&rsquo;s Savior.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Unto Us a Child Being Born<br />and a Son Being Given</h2><p>Although this Christ who came to be our Savior was &ldquo;a child,&rdquo; He was called &ldquo;the mighty God.&rdquo; Although He was &ldquo;a son,&rdquo; He was called &ldquo;the eternal Father&rdquo; (Isa. 9:6). God&rsquo;s promise tells us clearly that the coming Christ is both man and God, both the Son and the Father. He became a man; nevertheless, He is God. He is the Son, yet He is also the Father. Although He came to the earth to be a newborn child, He is still the mighty God who is in the heavens. Although He was manifested to be the Son in time, He is also the self-existing and ever-existing Father in eternity.</p><h2 class="head3">3. His Goings Forth Having Been<br />from of Old, from Everlasting</h2><p>Although He was born in Bethlehem of Judah, His origin is from eternity (Micah 5:2). He is the eternal Father, yet He came to be a man in time. He certainly is God, and He surely is a man.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Concerning the Human Living of Christ</h2><p>The earthly human living of this Redeemer promised by God was clearly foretold to us in every aspect in detail. He was born lowly as a tender plant. He came from a poor family, as a root out of a dry ground, without a rich supply and without a comfortable living. Thus, He had no form nor comeliness; His visage was so marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men; and when we shall see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him (Isa. 53:2; 52:14; cf. 2 Cor. 8:9b; Matt. 13:55-57). Men would have expected that when the Redeemer came, His countenance would surely be desirable to them, just as Moses and David both were handsome in appearance (Acts 7:20; 1 Sam. 16:12). And yet He had no comeliness, but appeared worn and old. He was a man of thirty, but people took Him for a man of fifty (John 8:57). In reality, He was altogether lovely and entirely handsome; but this is invisible to our natural eyes and can only be seen through our spiritual eyes.</p><p>He became a man of sorrows, despised and rejected of men. We hid as it were our faces from Him, and the people of God esteemed Him not (Isa. 53:3; Psa. 22:6-7; Luke 23:11). He was destined to be despised and rejected, to endure suffering and hardship, and to grieve daily for the sinner&rsquo;s soul. With sacrificing love, He came to seek His people. However, they rejected Him, and would not even set their eyes upon Him.</p><p>Even so, God&rsquo;s anointed One still did not give up man. He preached the gospel to the poor and proclaimed the year of jubilee of the Lord (Isa. 61:1-2; Luke 4:18-19). He was the great light shining upon those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death (Isa. 9:2; Matt. 4:15-16). Moreover, He would be a light to the Gentiles, that God&rsquo;s salvation might be carried out to the ends of the earth (Isa. 49:6). He would not strive nor cry out. A bruised reed He would not break, and the smoking flax He would not quench (Isa. 42:1-3; Matt. 12:17-21). Not only would He not cry out in the streets, but He also would not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax. In the Old Testament time, Jewish children used to make flutes of reeds. When a reed was bruised and could not give the proper note, they broke it. The Jews also made torches with flax to burn the oil to give a shining light at night. However, when the oil ran out, the flax smoked and could not shine forth light. Then people would quench it and throw it away. The Jews who were against Christ were like a bruised reed and smoking flax. However, Christ was full of compassion toward them. He did not break them, and He did not quench them. He still opened the door of grace to them.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Concerning the Death of Christ</h2><p>He had done no violence, neither was any deceit in His mouth (Isa. 53:9). He had no transgressions, and He had never committed any sin. Nevertheless, men oppressed Him, persecuted Him, and even cut Him off. &ldquo;He was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth&rdquo; (Isa. 53:7; Matt. 27:12-14). When He was judged, He had just and good cause to muzzle the mouth of the false accusers, but He remained silent, like a sheep brought to the slaughter; for He was determined not to save Himself, in order that we might be saved.</p><p>When He died, He was numbered with the transgressors, yet He made intercession for them (Isa. 53:12; Luke 23:32-34). Man&rsquo;s evil intention was that He make His grave with the wicked, but God&rsquo;s arrangement was that He be buried with the rich (Isa. 53:9; Matt. 27:57-60). The year in which He died was the seventh year of the sixty-ninth week after the order was given to rebuild Jerusalem. This fulfilled the prophecy in the book of Daniel concerning the cutting off of the Messiah (Dan. 9:25-26).</p><p>The reason He was afflicted and put to death was because God wanted Him to bear our sin. The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all (Isa. 53:6). &ldquo;It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin&rdquo; (Isa. 53:10). Therefore, He was cut off and stricken because He bore our sins (Isa. 53:8). He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities, so that by His chastisement we might have peace, and with His stripes we might be healed (Isa. 53:5). He was chastised on our behalf, that we might be reconciled to God. The righteous God cannot lay again a claim on us. He was bruised on our behalf that our spirit might be healed and enlivened.</p><p>The scene and pain of His suffering of death are thoroughly described in one of the psalms of David (Psa. 22:1, 7-8, 12-18). Here, the Spirit of Christ, in Christ&rsquo;s own words, describes both the terrifying scene around Him and His painful feelings inwardly and outwardly. He says that fierce evil men, like strong bulls, compassed Him and beset Him around. They gaped upon Him with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion. All they who saw Him laughed Him to scorn; they shot out the lip and shook the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord that He would deliver Him: let Him deliver Him, seeing He delighted in Him (cf. Matt. 27:39-40, 43). At that moment, because He bore our sins, God forsook Him; He then cried out, saying, &ldquo;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo; (Matt. 27:46). As He gave up His life, He was poured out like water. He hung on the cross for several hours, so that even His bones were out of joint and He could tell all His bones. Because He suffered the judgment of God for us and was consumed by the wrath of God, His heart was like wax melted in the midst of His bowels, and His strength was dried up like a potsherd. His pain was so severe that even His tongue cleaved to His jaws. Finally, He said that God had brought Him into the dust of death. The wicked, like dogs, compassed Him; they pierced His hands and His feet and looked and stared upon Him. They also parted His garments among them and cast lots for His vesture (Matt. 27:35).</p><h2 class="head2">H. Concerning the Resurrection of Christ</h2><p>After Christ was buried, God raised Him from the dead on the third day (Hosea 6:2; 1 Cor. 15:4). Because He is the Holy One of Jehovah, God would not leave His soul in hell, neither suffer Him to see corruption (Psa. 16:8-11; Acts 2:24-31). In resurrection, &ldquo;He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities&rdquo; (Isa. 53:11). Christ is the resurrected righteous Servant of Jehovah. Many believe in Him and are thus justified. He shall see of the travail of His soul and shall be satisfied. His travailing will produce a corporate Body which is the church, including all the redeemed believers.</p><p>&ldquo;He shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand&rdquo; (Isa. 53:10). The phrase &ldquo;he shall prolong his days&rdquo; means that He shall be resurrected and live forever. Furthermore, He will impart His life to men, and make them His seed, that through them He can fulfill the pleasure of the Lord.</p><p>In His resurrection, Christ was begotten as the firstborn Son of God (Psa. 2:7; Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5-6; Rom. 8:29). In His divinity Christ was the only begotten Son of God from eternity to eternity; but in His humanity He became the firstborn Son of God through resurrection. Psalm 22:22 says, &ldquo;I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.&rdquo; This means that in His resurrection not only was He begotten to be the firstborn Son of God, but we were also begotten to become the many sons of God, having God&rsquo;s life and becoming His brothers. Thus, He can declare God&rsquo;s name to us and also praise God in our midst. Through resurrection He gains men to be His brothers and become His church. Thus He can reveal God and praise God in the church.</p><h2 class="head2">I. Concerning the Ascension of Christ</h2><p>In the promise of God&rsquo;s redemption, Christ not only died for us and was resurrected for us, but He also ascended for us. Through His death He solves all of our problems; through His resurrection He imparts God&rsquo;s life into us; and in His ascension He brings us into a heavenly position.</p><p>Christ shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high (Isa. 52:13; Eph. 1:20-21). The ascended Christ is far above all rule, authority, power, lordship, and dominion in the universe. He has ascended to the highest place in the universe, the third heaven, where God dwells.</p><p>Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men (Eph. 4:8; Psa. 68:18). &ldquo;Those&rdquo; refers to the redeemed saints, who, before they were saved through the death and resurrection of Christ, were captured by Satan. In His ascension Christ captured them; in other words, the Lord delivered them from the captivity of Satan unto Himself. Then in His ascension and through His resurrection life, He turned these rescued sinners into gifts. These gifts are the gifted ones mentioned in Ephesians 4:11&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. He then gave them to His Body for the building up of the Body.</p><p>In His ascension, He sits on the right hand of God (Psa. 110:1; Acts 2:33-35). This Jesus, the Son of Man who was made a little inferior to the angels, was crowned with glory and honor, and was set over the works of God&rsquo;s hands (Psa. 8:4-6; Heb. 2:6-9). In His humanity, He was crowned with glory and honor. He was a man who ascended to the height, and He was also a man who was crowned.</p><p>God further promised that the ascended Christ would pour out the Holy Spirit. Joel 2:28-29 says, &ldquo;And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh;...and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.&rdquo; This promise of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit has already been fulfilled partially in the disciples on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:33), and it will be fulfilled completely in all the repentant Israelites (Zech. 12:10).</p><h2 class="head2">J. Concerning the Second Coming of Christ</h2><p>In the promise of God&rsquo;s redemption Christ&rsquo;s second coming is clearly mentioned: &ldquo;one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven&rdquo; (Dan. 7:13; Matt. 24:30; 26:64; Rev. 14:14). This refers to the open aspect of Christ&rsquo;s second coming. In His first coming, Christ manifested His power in healing the sick and in casting out demons, proving that He is the heavenly King. However, in His second coming He will come with full authority and power to execute God&rsquo;s judgment, to destroy Antichrist and his army, and to bind Satan, thus building up His kingdom on earth.</p><p>&ldquo;And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east&rdquo; (Zech. 14:4; Acts 1:10-12). Before the Lord&rsquo;s coming, all the surrounding nations will gather their armies together to the valley of Jehoshaphat for a battle (Joel 3:9-13), which is also called the battle of Armageddon (Rev. 16:12-16). At that time all the nations will gather together against Jerusalem to battle (Zech. 14:1-2). At the pressing moment, Christ will come with myriads of His saints (Jude 14; Zech. 14:5), and His feet will stand upon the Mount of Olives. Then the Mount of Olives will be split in two, the north and the south, due to a great earthquake. All the persecuted chosen ones will flee from the valley, and they will look up and see their Savior, the Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth, the One &ldquo;whom they have pierced&rdquo; (Zech. 12:10). They will ask Him: &ldquo;What are these wounds in thine hands?&rdquo; Then He will answer, &ldquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends&rdquo; (Zech. 13:6). Then the whole house of Israel will repent, crying and mourning for the sin of forsaking their Messiah. God will open a fountain of grace for them for sin and for uncleanness (Zech. 13:1). Christ will also fight for His people. He is the stone to smite the nations, and the nations will be scattered like chaff from the threshing floor (Dan. 2:34-35; Rev. 19:11-21). This stone will become a huge mountain, that is, the kingdom of God, filling the whole earth. Christ will be the King to build up His kingdom on the earth (Zech. 14:9-11; Rev. 11:15), just as Genesis 49:10 says, &ldquo;Until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.&rdquo; The meaning of the word Shiloh is &ldquo;a peace-giver,&rdquo; denoting the coming Christ. When Christ comes again He will be the King of peace, the Peace-giver. The whole earth will be full of peace in that age. Isaiah 2:1-3 and 11:10 also show that at Christ&rsquo;s second coming, at the beginning of the millennium, all the nations will become obedient to Christ. They will come to worship Him and to receive His instruction.</p><p>Thus, in the Old Testament, God has made clear beforehand every aspect of His redemption: that He would become a man, that He would live a human life on earth, that He would bear man&rsquo;s sins and suffer death on the cross, that He would be raised from among the dead that man may receive His life and become His brothers, and that He will come again to execute God&rsquo;s judgment against Satan, terminate the age, and bring in His kingdom. All of these have been clearly spoken and promised to us in the Old Testament.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>After man&rsquo;s fall, God immediately came in and promised redemption to fallen sinners. First, He promised that Christ would come as the seed of woman to destroy Satan who had poisoned man; later, He promised that Christ would come as the seed of Abraham, that all the nations on earth would be blessed; again, He promised that Christ would come as the Lion of the tribe of Judah to defeat God&rsquo;s enemy; He also promised that Christ would come as the seed of David to establish God&rsquo;s kingdom. The clear promise concerning Christ&rsquo;s birth, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and second coming was also given by God in the Old Testament to the people He intended to redeem.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>Was God&rsquo;s plan of redemption part of His original plan, or was it something added later?</li><li>After man&rsquo;s fall, what was God&rsquo;s first promise of redemption to man?</li><li>What was God&rsquo;s second promise of redemption to man?

In this lesson we will examine the portion of the Old Testament from Adam to Noah.</p><h2 class="head1">I. IN ADAM IS SEEN GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Receiving the Promise of God&rsquo;s Redemption</h2><p>Immediately after the fall, Adam and Eve realized that they had violated God&rsquo;s prohibition against eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge. They also realized that the result of their transgression was to be death. Therefore, they hid themselves from the Lord&rsquo;s presence, awaiting the sentence of death. However, God came in, not to declare the sentence of death, but to preach the gospel, giving them a wonderful promise that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Experiencing the Anticipated<br />Redemption of God</h2><p>Besides receiving the promise of God&rsquo;s redemption, Adam also experienced the anticipated redemption of God. (The actual redemption was to be accomplished four thousand years later.) After their fall, Adam and Eve realized that they were sinful. Thus, they tried to help themselves by making skirts of fig leaves to cover their nakedness. This indicates that they attempted to cover their sinful self with their own works. Before the fall man did not need blood to redeem him, but after the fall he needed the bleeding sacrifice to redeem him. Thus, man&rsquo;s attempt to cover his nakedness with the product of the vegetable life can never work. The skirts that Adam and Eve made from fig leaves did not cover their nakedness in the eyes of God.</p><p>In Genesis 3:20, after Adam heard the glad tidings, he immediately called his wife&rsquo;s name Eve, which means living. He believed that he and his wife were going to live and not die. Because of Adam&rsquo;s believing, we see God&rsquo;s justification in verse 21. After Adam believed in the glad tidings, God made coats of skins of the sacrifice for him and his wife and clothed them. The coats fully covered them. This means that God justified them (Gen. 3:21). To be justified means to be covered with the righteousness of God, which is Christ Himself. Adam and Eve&rsquo;s being under the coats of the skins of the sacrifice signified that they had put on Christ. Christ as God&rsquo;s righteousness covered them.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Through the Substitution<br />of the Bleeding Sacrifice</h2><p>In order to make coats of the skins of the lambs, God probably killed the lambs in the presence of Adam and Eve. Thus, the blood of the lambs was shed, for without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness (Heb. 9:22). We have been redeemed by the precious blood of God&rsquo;s Lamb, who was ordained by God for us before the foundation of the world (1 Pet. 1:18-20) and was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). Christ is the Lamb of God. Hence, we can see a picture of the shedding of Christ&rsquo;s blood there in the garden of Eden. Without the shedding of blood, God cannot cover the fallen man. On the cross Christ was killed by the righteous God. Through the shedding of His blood God can now cover us with Christ as our righteousness. In the garden of Eden Adam experienced the anticipated redemption. His putting on of the coats of skins was based upon the shedding of the blood of the sacrifice, for the sacrificial lamb became a substitute for sinful man.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Through the Union of the Covering Skins</h2><p>Genuine substitution is based upon union. Adam and Eve were sinful, and the lambs were killed and their blood shed for their sins. But if the lambs and Adam and Eve had been separated from one another, the lambs could not have substituted for them. Once Adam believed in the gospel, God covered him with a coat of lamb skins, and he became one with the lamb. The sinner had become one with the substitute. This is union. Union brings about the effectiveness of substitution. Once we participate in that union, whatever the substitute has accomplished is ours. Christ has done everything for us on the cross. Since we are one with Christ, whatever Christ has accomplished on the cross becomes ours. Hence, when Adam and Eve put on the coats of skins made by God, this typifies that they had believed into Christ and become one with Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">II. IN ABEL IS SEEN GOD&rsquo;S WAY OF REDEMPTION&mdash;<br />ACCEPTANCE BY GOD THROUGH THE SACRIFICE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Abel Working and Living for God&mdash;<br />&ldquo;a Feeder of Sheep&rdquo;</h2><p>Abel worked and lived for God; he also lived by God. He was a feeder of sheep for God (Gen. 4:2, Heb.). During Abel&rsquo;s time sheep were not to be eaten by men, because before the flood men were allowed to feed upon vegetables and fruits only (Gen. 1:29). Therefore, Abel&rsquo;s feeding the sheep was not to seek food for his own existence. He did not work and live for himself as Cain did, but for God&rsquo;s satisfaction as God desired. It seems that the purpose and interest of his life was to satisfy God in God&rsquo;s way.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Abel Worshipping God<br />according to God&rsquo;s Revelation</h2><p>Abel did not present his sacrifice according to his concept, thought, or way, but according to God&rsquo;s way of salvation. He worshipped God according to His revelation (Heb. 11:4). He knew that he had been born of fallen parents and that he was evil, sinful, and polluted in the eyes of God. He needed an offering with the shedding of blood to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirement and the skins of the sacrifice to cover the naked man. Therefore, the Bible says that Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof (Gen. 4:4). When he offered the fat, the sacrifice was killed and the blood was shed. The shedding of the blood was for his redemption, and the burning of the fat was for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. He did this according to the instruction of his parents. What Abel did corresponded exactly to the requirements of the Mosaic law which was given later by God. This proves that his way of worshipping God was according to God&rsquo;s revelation, not according to his concept.</p><p>According to Numbers 18:17, the firstling of a cow or sheep, a type of Christ, could not be eaten by the Israelites; it had to be offered to God. Hence, in typology Abel offered Christ to God. The offering of the firstling of a cow or sheep had two factors: the blood, which was sprinkled on the altar for redemption, and the fat, which was burned on the altar as an offering, as a sweet savor unto the Lord for His satisfaction. The Lord Jesus Christ had these two factors. He had the blood which was shed for us and the fat which satisfied God&rsquo;s desire. Abel, seeing God&rsquo;s way of redemption, presented such an offering to God and was accepted by God.</p><h2 class="head1">III. IN ENOSH IS SEEN MAN&rsquo;S NEED FOR GOD<br />AND MAN&rsquo;S CALLING UPON HIM<br />TO ENJOY GOD&rsquo;S RICHES</h2><p>Enosh means frail, mortal man. After the fall, not only did human life become a vanity, but man also became frail and mortal. When we see that our life is vanity and that we ourselves are frail, spontaneously we will call upon the name of the Lord. This is the reason that Genesis 4:26 says, &ldquo;Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.&rdquo; From the time of Enosh, the third generation of mankind, men began to call upon the name of the Lord, realizing their weakness, fragility, and mortality.</p><p>In Hebrew, the word for &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; is Jehovah. The name Jehovah begins to appear from Genesis chapter two; it is primarily used for God in relation to man. Jehovah is the name for God coming into an intimate relationship with man. Hence, Genesis 4:26 does not say that men began to call on the name of God, but on the name of Jehovah. Men did not call on the One who created all things, but on the One who was so near to them, on the One who was closely related to them. The name Jehovah means &ldquo;I AM THAT I AM&rdquo; (Exo. 3:14); He is the One existing from eternity to eternity. He is the One who was in the past, who is in the present, and who will be in the future forever. He is the eternal One. When men realized that they were fragile and mortal, they began to call on Jehovah, the eternal One. This calling began even with the third human generation. It continues throughout the Bible, and it was also practiced by the New Testament saints (Acts 9:14; 22:16; 1 Cor. 1:2).</p><h2 class="head1">IV. IN ENOCH IS SEEN<br />ONE WHO WAS REDEEMED<br />AND WHO WALKED WITH GOD<br />ON THE PATHWAY OF REDEMPTION</h2><p>Genesis 5 is a record of the living and begetting of some saved people, but they still lived under the ultimate result of the fall&mdash;death. Among these records, we find that one generation escaped death, and that was Enoch. Enoch walked with God for three hundred years, and God took him away (Gen. 5:24). The reason that God took Enoch away was that he should not see death (Heb. 11:5). His being kept away from death was God&rsquo;s ultimate salvation. This is salvation in full.</p><p>The way to escape from death was discovered by the seventh generation of mankind. Calling on the name of the Lord was discovered by the third generation, and four generations later, the way to escape the ultimate issue of man&rsquo;s fall was discovered by the seventh generation, Enoch. Enoch lived in such a way that he was kept from the power of death. Before Enoch was taken up by the Lord and while he was living and walking on earth, death could not kill him. Enoch overcame the killing of death.</p><p>Enoch was the first person to be raptured. To be raptured is to be matured in life by walking with God. To walk with God is not to override God, not to be presumptuous, not to do things according to our own concept and desire, nor to do anything without God. To walk with God is to take Him as our center and everything, to do things with Him according to His revelation and leading, and to do everything with Him. It is not only to live for God and to do things for God, but to do things according to God and with God. Enoch walked with God in such a way, living and doing things according to God and with God, not according to his own desire or concept, nor according to the current of the age in which he lived.</p><p>Enoch&rsquo;s being taken away by God did not happen suddenly. He continually walked upward with God until he touched heaven. Enoch walked with God day and night for three centuries, for more than a hundred thousand days. He walked with God day by day, becoming a little closer to God each day. At the age of three hundred sixty-five, as he was nearly touching heaven, he was taken away by God.</p><h2 class="head1">V. IN NOAH IS SEEN ONE WHO WALKED WITH GOD<br />AND WORKED WITH GOD TO MEET<br />THE NEED OF THAT GENERATION</h2><p>Man went from Adam to Abel and from Abel to Enosh, then he began to call on the name of the Lord to enjoy all His riches. Then in Enoch we see a man who walked with God. In Genesis 6 we see that Noah certainly was saved, pleased God, called on God, and enjoyed all that He is. In addition to all these positive aspects of the life of the saved ones, Genesis 6 shows us even more items.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Walking with God</h2><p>Genesis 6:9 says that Noah walked with God. Undoubtedly, Noah inherited all the spiritual blessings from his forefathers, such as Adam, Abel, Enosh, and Enoch, and he followed his great grandfather, Enoch, to walk with God in a crooked, perverse, and adulterous generation. Noah stood for a strong continuation of the line of life and, with much development, he carried it on further.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Building the Ark</h2><p>Since Noah had found grace, walked with God by faith, and inherited righteousness, God was very happy with him, so He opened Himself to him, telling him to build the ark (Gen. 6:13-14). Thus, Noah was not only one who walked with God, but also the one who built the ark. The ark was for salvation. At that time, the ark of salvation was built up by Noah. Abel offered gifts to God, Enosh called on God, Enoch walked with God, but Noah, in addition to doing all of these things, did something more&mdash;he built the ark.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Changing the Age through His Life and Work</h2><p>Noah&rsquo;s life and work were not simply a matter of walking with God or of building the ark, but also one of changing that age. Satan had corrupted that age to the uttermost, and even God repented that He had made man on earth. But Noah found grace. Noah&rsquo;s life was a life that changed the age. If we want to understand that Noah&rsquo;s life was a life that changed the age, we must see God&rsquo;s economy and purpose when God first created man.</p><p>There is a great contrast between Genesis 1 and 6. If you read the latter part of Genesis 1, you will see that God created man in His own image for the purpose of expressing Himself (1:26). God intended that man be His expression. Man was like a photograph, made in the image of God to express God. Furthermore, man was also committed with God&rsquo;s authority that he might exercise this authority for God&rsquo;s dominion on earth. Man was entrusted with God&rsquo;s authority that he might represent God and set up a dominion on earth over all God&rsquo;s creatures.</p><p>After God created man, He said, &ldquo;Very good&rdquo; (Gen. 1:31). On the second day of His work, God did not say anything, because on that day there were fallen angels in the air and demons in the water. It was impossible for God to say, &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; on that day. In the other days, God simply said, &ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Only on the sixth day, the day in which God created man, God looked at His work, especially on man, and said, &ldquo;Very good!&rdquo; In God&rsquo;s eyes, man was very good.</p><p>In Genesis 6, God took another look at mankind. When God had His first look at mankind in Genesis 1, man was very good. But when God had another look at man in Genesis 6, He saw that man had become wicked and corrupt to the uttermost, and it grieved Him that He had made man. What a change from Genesis 1! Originally, man was on such a high level; but beginning from chapter three, he descended lower and lower. God is not a temporary God, but an eternal God. In Him there is no shadow of change (James 1:17). Once He makes a decision, it stands for eternity.</p><p>Let us read Genesis 6:5-7: &ldquo;And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.&rdquo; If that had been all, there would have been no hope. But verse 8 says, &ldquo;But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.&rdquo; This is one of the greatest verses in the book of Genesis. Satan was glad to hear that God was going to destroy man from the face of the earth, but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. That turned the situation and changed the age. God was not defeated! In the midst of apparent defeat, there was victory through a man who found grace in the eyes of the Lord. That was the turning point. If you read history along with the Bible, you will see that in every generation, when Satan has done his best to damage the situation to the uttermost, there has always been one man or a few people who found grace in the eyes of God and who became the ones who turned the age. In Genesis 6:8 it says, &ldquo;But Noah.&rdquo; At the bottom of man&rsquo;s fall, there is always a &ldquo;but.&rdquo; When man had fallen to the bottom, Noah was used by God to change the age.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>From Adam to Noah, the Bible gives us an illustration or portrait of God&rsquo;s redemption, of the way God wants His redeemed people to follow Him and of the work they should do. In Adam we see an illustration of God&rsquo;s redemption. In Abel we see an illustration of God&rsquo;s way of salvation&mdash;being acceptable to God by relying on the shedding of the blood of the sacrifices. In Enosh we see an illustration of man&rsquo;s need for God and man&rsquo;s calling on God to enjoy God&rsquo;s riches. In Enoch we have a portrait of a person who is redeemed and walks on the way of redemption. We see how he walks with God to be raptured and escape death. In Noah we see a person who walks with God, and we see how he works with God to meet the need of the age, thus being saved to enter into a new age. He was a person used by God to turn the age.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>How did Adam experience the anticipated redemption of God?</li><li>How did Abel worship God according to the revelation of God?</li><li>What is the meaning of &ldquo;Enosh&rdquo;?

IN ABRAHAM IS SEEN<br />GOD&rsquo;S CALLING, GOD&rsquo;S PROMISE,<br />JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH, THE LIVING BY FAITH,<br />AND THE LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</h2><h2 class="head2">A. God&rsquo;s Calling</h2><p>Abraham originally dwelt in Ur of the Chaldees. The background then was that of the fourth step of man&rsquo;s fall. First, man had conspired to rebel against God. Second, man had made bricks by his own labor to build a city and live a man-made godless life. Third, man had built a tower to declare his rejection of God and to make himself a name (Gen. 11:3-4). Fourth, according to Joshua 24:2, man had turned from God to serve idols, that is, to worship demons.</p><p>Abraham lived in such a dark age. But one day the God of glory appeared to him and called him to leave his country and his kindred and to go into a land which God would show him (Acts 7:3). The God of glory appeared to him, spoke to him, called him, and even gave him the promise.</p><p>God called Abraham twice. The first calling of God, referred to in Acts 7:3, was when Abraham was at Ur. God called Abraham out of his country and his kindred into the land which He would show him. Abraham, however, did not accept that calling immediately, and God sovereignly caused his father, Terah, to bring the family from Ur to Haran. They stayed there until Terah died (Gen. 11:31-32). Then, God appeared to Abraham the second time (Gen. 12:1) and told him to leave his country, his kindred, and also his father&rsquo;s house. In God&rsquo;s second calling, He not only told Abraham to leave his country and his kindred but also his father&rsquo;s house. Furthermore, God gave him the promise in three aspects.</p><h2 class="head2">B. God&rsquo;s Promise</h2><h2 class="head3">1. To Make Abraham a Great Nation</h2><p>In Genesis 12:2 God said to Abraham, &ldquo;I will make of thee a great nation.&rdquo; God promised Abraham that He would make of him a great nation, which is the kingdom of God, composed of the nation of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament, the millennial kingdom in the coming age, and the new heaven and the new earth in eternity.</p><h2 class="head3">2. To Bless Abraham</h2><p>God promised to bless Abraham (Gen. 12:2). This is the blessing of God&rsquo;s creation and redemption, including all that God wants to give man&mdash;God Himself and all that He has in this age and in the age to come. Galatians 3:14 shows us that this blessing eventually is the promise of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head3">3. To Make Abraham and His Seed a Blessing<br />to All the Families of the Earth</h2><p>God not only promised that He would be a blessing to Abraham, but that Abraham and his seed would be a blessing to all the families, all the nations, of the earth (Gen. 12:3; 22:18). In His calling, God turned from Adam to Abraham, indicating that He gave up the Adamic race. But, in His promise, God turned again from Abraham back to all the families of the Adamic race through Christ, the seed of Abraham (Gal. 3:14, 16).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Justification by Faith</h2><p>God gave the promise to Abraham, and Abraham believed in Him. So God counted it to him for righteousness (Gen. 15:5-6). This was his justification by faith before God (Rom. 4:21-24).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Living by Faith</h2><p>Hebrews 11:8-9 says, &ldquo;By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to go out to a place which he was about to receive for an inheritance, and he went out without knowing where he was going. By faith he dwelt as a foreigner in the land of promise as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head3">1. Building an Altar</h2><p>From Haran Abraham brought Sarah his wife, Lot his brother&rsquo;s son, and all their substance and people into the land of Canaan. When Abraham came to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh, Jehovah appeared again to him, and there he built an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared to him (Gen. 12:7).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Pitching a Tent</h2><p>After Abraham built an altar, he pitched a tent (Gen. 12:8). At Babel, the people first built a city and then erected a tower. But Abraham first built an altar and then erected a tent. This means that Abraham was for God. He first took care of the worship of God, his fellowship with God. Then he took care of his living. His dwelling in a tent also shows that he did not belong to the world, but lived the life of a sojourner on the earth.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Fighting for the Brother</h2><p>Abraham&rsquo;s nephew, Lot, had separated himself from Abraham and dwelt in Sodom. Because of the fighting between the four kings and the five kings, Lot was taken captive. When Abraham heard this, he led forth his trained men who were born in his house, and fought against the four kings; he smote them and brought back all the goods. After his return, Melchisedec, king of Salem, met him with bread and wine and blessed him (Gen. 14:18). Melchisedec as the priest of the Most High God is a type of Christ as God&rsquo;s High Priest (Heb. 7:1-3, 16-17). Christ today is the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec. He is always living to intercede for us and to nourish us with bread and wine.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Living in Fellowship with God</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Communion with God on the Human Level</h2><p>Genesis 18 speaks of Abraham&rsquo;s intimate experience of God. When Abraham was sitting in the tent door one day, he saw three men coming to him. Of the three, one was Jehovah God and the other two were angels. Abraham prepared water for God to wash His feet and served Him with a meal. Thus, Abraham enjoyed the sweet fellowship with God, and in this fellowship he received the revelation from God regarding the birth of Isaac and the destruction of Sodom.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Offering of Isaac</h2><p>Genesis 22 speaks of the peak of Abraham&rsquo;s experience with God. In verse 2 God said to Abraham, &ldquo;Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.&rdquo; How difficult it must have been for Abraham to do this! By faith, however, Abraham immediately obeyed God&rsquo;s word and did it. Abraham took his son and journeyed three days to the mountain. &ldquo;And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood&rdquo; (v. 9). As he stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son, the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said, &ldquo;Lay not thine hand upon the lad&rdquo; (v. 12). Then God prepared a ram to replace Isaac. Therefore, as far as Abraham was concerned, Isaac was raised from among the dead. This was Abraham&rsquo;s peak experience in satisfying God because of his obedience by faith. The offering of Isaac typifies the offering of Christ, God&rsquo;s only begotten Son, on the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">II. IN ISAAC IS SEEN THE INHERITING OF GRACE<br />AND THE RESTING AND ENJOYING</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Inheriting Grace</h2><p>In the record of Isaac&rsquo;s life the experience of grace is implied. Isaac experienced the inheriting of God&rsquo;s grace.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Born of Grace</h2><p>After God dealt with Abraham&rsquo;s natural strength and self-effort, Isaac was born. This means that Isaac was born of grace, which is signified by Sarah (Gal. 4:24-28, 31).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Grown in Grace</h2><p>Isaac was grown up in grace (Gen. 21:8). From his history we know that he did not labor to do much. He was born in grace, and he was also grown in grace.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Being the Heir in Grace</h2><p>Isaac also became the heir in grace (Gen. 21:9-12). All that his father had was his, for Abraham gave all his riches to this unique heir. It was by grace, not by his effort, that he became the heir of his father&rsquo;s riches.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Inheriting the Promise Given to His Father</h2><p>Isaac inherited not only all that his father had, but also the promise which God had given to his father, especially the aspect concerning Christ as the blessing to all the nations of the earth (Gen. 26:3-5).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Resting and Enjoying</h2><p>Isaac&rsquo;s entire life was a life of rest and enjoyment without much suffering. He was always calm and restful. Isaac was not a laboring person; he was a person of enjoyment. His father and his servant did everything to secure a bride, Rebekah, for him (Gen. 24:61-67). Throughout his entire life, he never suffered thirst. Wherever he went, whether to a wrong place or a right one, there was always a well. In sowing, Isaac received a hundredfold harvest and became very great (Gen. 26:12-14).</p><h2 class="head1">III. IN JACOB IS SEEN GOD&rsquo;S SELECTION,<br />THE TRANSFORMATION IN LIFE,<br />AND THE MATURITY IN LIFE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. God&rsquo;s Selection</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Before His Birth</h2><p>Jacob was chosen before his birth, even before the foundation of the world. &ldquo;And the children struggled together within her;...And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels;...and the elder shall serve the younger&rdquo; (Gen. 25:22-23). Before the children were born, God had already said that the elder would serve the younger, for God had chosen the younger Jacob. According to Ephesians 1:4, God&rsquo;s choosing is long before the foundation of the world.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Not of His Own Works,<br />but of God Who Calls</h2><p>Romans 9:11, referring to Jacob and Esau, says, &ldquo;The children not yet being born, nor having done anything good or bad, (that the purpose of God according to selection might remain, not of works, but of Him who calls).&rdquo; In this verse we see that God&rsquo;s selection does not depend on our works, but on God who calls.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Transformation in Life</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Being Dealt With</h2><p>Although Jacob was defeated in his mother&rsquo;s womb by his brother and was born second, he kept struggling to seize the birthright. After Jacob finally seized the birthright and his father&rsquo;s blessing, Esau hated him and plotted to kill him. So he was forced to leave his parents and to flee to his uncle Laban.</p><p>Jacob, after coming to Laban&rsquo;s home, was dealt with even more than before. He was consumed in the day by the drought, and in the night by the frost. He could not sleep. He served Laban for fourteen years for his two daughters, and six years for his cattle. Laban changed his wages ten times (Gen. 31:40-41).</p><p>Jacob married Leah, Rachel, and the two maids, begetting twelve sons and one daughter. They were all used by God to deal with Jacob from every side in order that he might be transformed.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Being Met by God and Receiving God&rsquo;s Promise</h2><p>During his escape to Laban&rsquo;s house, Jacob one night lay down to sleep in the wilderness, taking a stone for a pillow. As he dreamed, he saw a ladder set up on the earth. And the Lord stood above the ladder and said, &ldquo;I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed...and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed&rdquo; (Gen. 28:10-14). Furthermore, God promised that He would give him and his seed the land of Canaan and that in his seed (Christ) all the families of the earth would be blessed, just as God had promised to Abraham and Isaac. So Jacob took the stone that he had put for his pillow and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel, the house of God (Gen. 28:18-19).</p><h2 class="head3">3. Being Broken</h2><p>Genesis 32:22-32 relates a crucial experience in Jacob&rsquo;s life. Jacob&rsquo;s experience in this chapter is practical, personal, and intimate. The Lord in the form of man wrestled with Jacob &ldquo;until the breaking of the day&rdquo; (v. 24). He did this in order to expose Jacob&rsquo;s natural life. As the day was dawning, the man touched the hollow of Jacob&rsquo;s thigh and Jacob was crippled. Jacob asked the man to bless him, but the man asked Jacob, &ldquo;What is thy name?&rdquo; The Lord wanted Jacob to know himself; then the man changed his name to Israel. The primary meaning of Israel is &ldquo;a wrestler with God,&rdquo; and the secondary meaning is &ldquo;the prince of God.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head3">4. Being Transformed</h2><p>In Genesis 35 God told Jacob to go up to Bethel, so Jacob took his household and went. Before they left for Bethel, however, they made a thorough clearance by putting away their foreign gods, purifying themselves, and changing their garments, that is, their manner of life (v. 2). Upon arriving at Bethel, Jacob built an altar. There God appeared to him and again changed his name to Israel. And Jacob set up a pillar of stone and poured upon it a drink offering and oil. He called the name of the place Bethel (vv. 14-15).</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Maturity in Life</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Heart Numb, but the Spirit Revived</h2><p>When Jacob heard in his old age that Joseph had become ruler over all the land of Egypt, what was his reaction? We are told that his heart became numb, but that his spirit was revived (Gen. 45:26-27, Heb.). His soul life was deadened, but his spirit and his soul had been divided. So when he heard the good news concerning Joseph, his reaction was that his heart became numb yet his spirit was revived.</p><h2 class="head3">2. No Begging after Arriving in Egypt</h2><p>After Jacob arrived in Egypt he did not beg for anything. However, when he was young, he did not only beg but also supplanted others.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Blessing People</h2><p>The strongest sign of Jacob&rsquo;s maturity was his blessing others. After arriving in Egypt, he blessed Pharaoh (Gen. 47:7, 10). According to Hebrews 7:7, &ldquo;the lesser is blessed by the greater.&rdquo; Thus, the fact that Jacob blessed Pharaoh was a proof that he was greater than Pharaoh.</p><p>Jacob also blessed Joseph and Joseph&rsquo;s two sons, and all his children, one by one, and he even prophesied through his blessing (Gen. 49:1-28).</p><h2 class="head1">IV. IN JOSEPH IS SEEN THE REIGNING ASPECT<br />OF THE MATURITY IN LIFE</h2><p>Joseph&rsquo;s biography indicates that he had no defects and was altogether perfect. Joseph signifies the reigning aspect of a matured saint, the matured Israel.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Joseph&rsquo;s Life Being a Part of Jacob&rsquo;s Generation</h2><p>Genesis 37:2 says, &ldquo;These are the generations of Jacob.&rdquo; Then it goes on to tell us of the life of Joseph. This proves that Joseph&rsquo;s life was a part of Jacob&rsquo;s generation.</p><p>The biographies of Joseph and Jacob are blended together in Genesis because they are actually the biography of one person, not of two.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Joseph Being Given the Authority to Reign</h2><p>Joseph was sold into Egypt by his brothers, and then he was imprisoned due to the false accusation of the wife of Potiphar, the captain of the guard, but God was with him. Later, Pharaoh dreamed, yet no one but Joseph could interpret the dreams. Pharaoh saw that the Spirit of God was in him and that he was discreet and wise, so Pharaoh set him over all the land of Egypt (Gen. 41:38-41). Joseph&rsquo;s reigning actually was the reigning of Jacob through Joseph.</p><h2 class="head1">V. ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB,<br />INCLUDING JOSEPH, BEING THREE ASPECTS<br />OF A COMPLETE EXPERIENCE IN LIFE</h2><p>The called race began with Abraham, passed through Isaac, and was completed with Jacob. Even though Abraham had a good beginning with being called, there is no record of his being chosen or of his reaching an ultimate and matured life. For this completion, Abraham needed Jacob. In Jacob we see that the called one was chosen long before his birth; in him we also see the maturity in life. His hands were hands of supplanting, but in his old age, his hands became hands of blessing. Jacob became fully mature. He reached a level of maturity such that he was reigning over the whole land. (The reigning of Joseph was the reigning of Jacob.) In Jacob&rsquo;s life, however, we cannot see the calling, justification by faith, and the living by faith. He was a person without faith; he supplanted everything. Moreover, in both Abraham and Jacob we cannot see the inheriting of grace, nor the resting and enjoying. Isaac was one who did not labor and struggle. He just inherited, rested, and enjoyed. In Isaac, however, we cannot see the selection, the calling and the maturity in life.</p><p>If we add all the experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob together, we see a clear picture of the complete experience of a called one. In them we see God&rsquo;s selection, God&rsquo;s calling, justification by faith, the living in fellowship with God, the inheriting of grace, the resting and enjoying, the transformation in life, and the maturity in life.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>From Abraham to Joseph, the Bible gives a full picture of a person chosen by God, from being called by God to maturing in life. In Abraham, we see God&rsquo;s calling, justification by faith, living by faith, and dwelling in fellowship with God. In Isaac, we see the inheritance of grace and also the rest and enjoyment gained through grace. In Jacob, we see God&rsquo;s choosing, transformation in life, and maturing in life. In Joseph, we see the aspect of reigning in the maturity of life.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>What experiences of a called one do we see in Abraham?</li><li>What was the manifestation of Abraham&rsquo;s living by faith?</li><li>What was the peak of Abraham&rsquo;s experience of God?</li><li>What experiences of a called one do we see in Isaac?</li><li>What experiences of a called one do we see in Jacob?</li><li>What was the common promise God gave to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?

IN MOSES ARE SEEN GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION,<br />SUPPLY, EXPRESSION, AND LEADING</h2><p>In Genesis we do not see a clear picture of redemption. With Abraham we see God&rsquo;s calling, but there is no account of Abraham&rsquo;s redemption. The picture we see in all of Isaac&rsquo;s experience is a picture of the enjoyment of the rich inheritance rather than a picture of God&rsquo;s redemption. With Jacob, even though he was eventually transformed into an Israel, a prince of God, there is also no record regarding his experience of redemption. In the book of Exodus, however, we can see in Moses a clear and full picture concerning God&rsquo;s redemption.</p><p>In the book of Genesis neither do we see God&rsquo;s glory manifested among His people in a substantial way. However, in chapter forty of Exodus, when Moses erected the tabernacle, not only did the glory of God come down upon it, but it also filled it. Thus, in Moses we also see the expression of God&rsquo;s glory.</p><h2 class="head2">A. God&rsquo;s Redemption</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Preparation of a Vessel for Redemption</h2><p>Moses was a vessel prepared by God for redemption. Pharaoh held the children of Israel in slavery and also sought to kill all the baby boys born to the Hebrew women (Exo. 1:11, 13-14, 16). God, however, heard His people&rsquo;s cry and came down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians (Exo. 3:7-8). Hence, He prepared Moses to be a savior for the children of Israel.</p><p>After Moses&rsquo; mother gave birth to Moses, she hid him for three months. When she could no longer hide him, she put him in an ark of papyrus and laid it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile, and Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter took him up and nurtured him as her own son. In the royal palace Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and deeds. But when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel. Seeing one of them being oppressed by an Egyptian, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand (Exo. 2:12). Now he supposed that his brothers would understand that God through his hand would give salvation to them; but they did not understand. Thus, he was rejected by them (Acts 7:25-28). Later, he fled and dwelt in the land of Midian, where he begot two sons.</p><p>After forty years, God appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai in a flame of fire out of a thorn bush and appointed him a leader and a savior to deliver the children of Israel out of the tyranny of Egypt and lead them out of the land of Egypt, the land of bondage, into the land of Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey. Moses performed wonders and miracles in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years to lead God&rsquo;s people out. Hence, in Moses we see a complete picture of God&rsquo;s redemption, including the Passover, the exodus from Egypt, and the crossing of the Red Sea.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Passover</h2><p>In order to deliver His people out of the land of Egypt, the land of bondage, God sent ten plagues through Moses to punish the Egyptians. After nine plagues, however, the Egyptians were still hardened in their hearts and would not let them go. Hence, God sent the last plague, the slaying of all the firstborn, to demonstrate His power and to accomplish His way of salvation.</p><p>God commanded the children of Israel, saying, &ldquo;All the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die&rdquo; (Exo. 11:5), but for Israel God established a way of salvation. God commanded the children of Israel to take to them a lamb without blemish for every household. They were to kill the lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month and strike its blood on the side posts and the upper doorposts of every house, and then at midnight God would pass through the land and go in to smite the firstborn of those whose doors were not sprinkled with the blood. Therefore, on the fourteenth day of the first month at midnight Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. Only the houses of the children of Israel were passed over, because of the blood of the Passover lamb that was sprinkled on the side posts and upper doorposts of their houses. Also, that night all the children of Israel had their loins girded, had shoes on their feet, and had a staff in their hand (Exo. 12:11), and they stayed in their houses to eat the flesh of the lamb. The Passover portrayed in Exodus 12 is a clear, adequate, and even all-inclusive type of the redemption of Christ.</p><h2 class="head4">a. A Type of Christ</h2><p>The Passover is a type of Christ. In 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul says that &ldquo;our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed.&rdquo; Here Paul does not say that Christ is our lamb; he says that Christ is our Passover. Christ is not only the Passover lamb, but also every aspect of the Passover. The lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs are all related to Christ. In principle, therefore, Christ is not only the lamb of the Passover, but the very Passover itself.</p><p>The word Passover means that the judgment of God passes over us. In Exodus 12:13 God says, &ldquo;When I see the blood, I will pass over you.&rdquo; According to Exodus 12, God passed over the children of Israel because the blood of the Passover lamb had been sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts of their houses. The children of Israel had been commanded to eat the flesh of the lamb in their houses. This indicates that the house was to be their covering under which and in which they could eat the flesh of the Passover lamb. The house that covered them was to have blood sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts. When God saw the blood, He passed over them. Hence, this passing over was due to the sprinkled blood.</p><p>In 1 Corinthians 5 Paul shows us that the Passover is related not only to the blood, but to Christ Himself. Are we today under the blood, or are we in Christ? Strictly speaking, to say that we are under the blood is not scriptural. This phrase is not found in the New Testament. But the New Testament says repeatedly that we are in Christ. According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, it is of God that we are in Christ. Because we are in Christ, He Himself becomes our covering. This means that before Christ can be our Passover, He must first be our covering. Our covering today is not the blood; it is Christ. In Exodus 12 the Passover was based on the blood. But today our Passover is based on Christ. This is the reason Paul could say that Christ is our Passover.</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Lamb of the Passover</h2><p>The children of Israel were commanded to take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house. Therefore, the Passover lamb was not for every individual but for every house. Furthermore, the lamb had to be without blemish, a male of the first year, taken either out from the sheep or from the goats (Exo. 12:3, 5). To be of the first year is to be fresh and not to be used for any other purpose. The lamb could be either of the sheep or of the goats. This indicates that when Christ was on the cross, He was both a sheep and a goat. In Himself Christ was altogether good. However, as our substitute, He was made sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21).</p><p>The Passover lamb had to be examined for four days (Exo. 12:3, 6). On the fourteenth day of the first month, the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel was to kill the lamb in the evening and take of the blood and put it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the house. The blood put on the lintel and the doorposts (Exo. 12:6, 7) was a sign for redemption, so that God could pass over when He saw this blood. The children of Israel ate the flesh of the lamb, which was roasted with fire (Exo. 12:8-10), in the house that had been sprinkled with the blood. This is for the life supply. To eat the lamb with its head, legs, and inwards signifies that we need to take Christ as a whole, in His entirety, and take His wisdom, activities, move, and inward parts. The flesh of the lamb was to be eaten with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. This signifies that when we enjoy Christ as our Passover, we must purge away everything sinful, and we also need to regret and repent regarding the sinful things. Nothing of the lamb was to be left until morning (Exo. 12:10), and not one of its bones was to be broken (Exo. 12:46).</p><p>While they were taking the Passover lamb, the Israelites should eat it with their loins girded, shoes on their feet, and staff in their hand; and they should eat it in haste (Exo. 12:17). The result of all these is the producing of God&rsquo;s army. &ldquo;And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies&rdquo; (Exo. 12:51). God&rsquo;s full redemption&mdash;the Passover&mdash;eventually produces an army to fight for God&rsquo;s interest.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Exodus from Egypt<br />and the Crossing of the Red Sea</h2><p>God&rsquo;s full salvation includes the Passover, the exodus, and the crossing of the Red Sea. Through the Passover the children of Israel were saved from God&rsquo;s judgment. When they were in Egypt they were like the Egyptians; they were sinful and even worshipped idols (Ezek. 20:7, 8). Along with the Egyptians, they were under the righteous judgment of God. According to God&rsquo;s righteous judgment, they were under the sentence of death. Therefore, the children of Israel needed the Passover lamb to be their substitute. Because the blood of the lamb had been applied to the doorpost of their houses, God in His righteous judgment could pass over them.</p><p>However, not only were the children of Israel under God&rsquo;s judgment; they were also under the tyranny of Pharaoh. Although the Passover was adequate to save them from God&rsquo;s judgment, it was not effective to rescue them from the usurpation of the Egyptians. In order to be saved from the Egyptian tyranny, the children of Israel needed the exodus and the crossing of the Red Sea.</p><h2 class="head4">a. The Exodus from Egypt</h2><p>In Exodus 12 we see that Pharaoh and the Egyptians were subdued by God to such an extent that they actually drove the children of Israel out of Egypt (12:29-33; 11:1). According to God&rsquo;s command, the children of Israel plundered the Egyptians of their gold, silver, and raiment (12:35-36; 3:21-22; 11:2-3). Not only so, they went forth from Egypt with all their children and their flocks and herds (12:37-38, 31-32). They had dwelt in the strange land of Egypt for four hundred and thirty years (12:40-41). The night of their exodus was a night of observation (12:42). Finally, when they made their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel had become the armies of Jehovah (12:41, 51).</p><h2 class="head4">b. The Crossing of the Red Sea</h2><p>If the children of Israel had only the exodus but not the crossing of the Red Sea, their salvation would not have been secure. It would have been possible for them to return to Egypt. Without the crossing of the Red Sea, there would have been no separating line. Therefore, in order to have a thorough and absolute deliverance from Egypt, they had to make their exodus and also cross over the separating line by passing through the Red Sea (Exo. 14:21-30).</p><h2 class="head5">(1) A Type of Baptism</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 10:1 and 2 Paul says that &ldquo;our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.&rdquo; This indicates that the crossing of the Red Sea was a type of baptism. In Egypt the children of Israel were involved with the evil, corrupt, and condemned world and were under God&rsquo;s judgment. They needed the Passover, a type of Christ, to save them from God&rsquo;s judgment. They also needed to be saved from Egypt through water. Therefore, with the children of Israel we see both the blood and the water. The blood of the Passover lamb saved them from God&rsquo;s judgment, and the water saved them from the tyranny of the Egyptians.</p><h2 class="head5">(2) Saved through Water</h2><p>Through water the children of Israel were saved from Egypt and its slavery (Exo. 13:3, 14), that is, from the world and its usurpation. This water also brought them into a realm where there was no bondage or slavery. In this realm they built the tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. This indicates that through the baptismal water we are saved from the world to a realm where we can accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose.</p><h2 class="head2">B. God&rsquo;s Supply</h2><p>Through the enjoyment of the Passover and the baptism in the Red Sea, the children of Israel made their exodus from Egypt and entered into the wilderness. Having enjoyed the supply of the Passover lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs, they were strengthened to go out of Egypt, to cross the Red Sea, and to enter into the wilderness.</p><p>Then through the tree which caused the bitter waters to become sweet (Exo. 15:23-25), the twelve springs of water in Elim (Exo. 15:27), the manna from heaven (Exo. 16:14-15, 31, 32), and the living water out of the smitten rock (Exo. 17:6), God brought the children of Israel to Mount Sinai. All these items signify that Christ is our life supply in every aspect. With this supply the Lord led the children of Israel to Mount Sinai.</p><p>Now we shall see two items of the life supply in the Lord&rsquo;s caring for His redeemed people.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Heavenly Manna&mdash;the Reconstitution<br />of His Redeemed Ones through a Change of Diet</h2><p>In Exodus 16 manna was sent from heaven to be food for God&rsquo;s people. For forty years in the wilderness, they depended on manna for sustenance.</p><p>By giving His people manna to eat, God indicated that His intention was to change the nature of His people. He wanted to change their being, their very constitution. They had already undergone a change of location. Formerly, they were in Egypt. Now, they were with the Lord in the wilderness, a place of separation. However, it is not sufficient merely to have a change of location, for this is too outward and too objective. There must also be an inward, subjective change, a change of life and nature. Therefore, the way for God to produce such a change in His people is by changing their diet. By eating Egyptian food God&rsquo;s people had been constituted with the element of Egypt. Although they had been brought out of Egypt into the wilderness of separation, they were still constituted with the element of Egypt. God&rsquo;s intention was to change their element by changing their diet. God wanted to feed them with food from heaven in order to reconstitute them. His desire was to fill them, to satisfy them, to satiate them with food from heaven, and thereby to make them a heavenly people.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Living Water out of the Smitten Rock</h2><p>In Exodus 17 &ldquo;all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin...and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink. Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). God commanded Moses, saying, &ldquo;Thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink&rdquo; (v. 6). In chapter sixteen we have a clear picture of manna from heaven, and in chapter seventeen, the record of the living water flowing out of the smitten rock. This indicates that after we experience Christ as manna, we also need to experience Him as the living water.</p><p>In typology, Moses signifies the law, and the rod represents the power and authority of the law. The rock typifies Christ. The smiting of the rock by the rod signifies that Christ was smitten by the authority of God&rsquo;s law. In the eyes of God, the Lord Jesus was put to death, not by the Jews, but by the law of God. During the first three hours of His crucifixion, Christ suffered under the hand of man. But during the last three hours, Christ suffered because He was smitten by the power of God&rsquo;s law.</p><p>Furthermore, the water flowing out of the smitten rock typifies the Spirit. John 7:37-39 say, &ldquo;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive.&rdquo; This clearly indicates that the flowing water signifies the Spirit.</p><p>Therefore, the significance of the smiting of the rock by the rod of Moses and the flowing out of the living water is that Christ is our rock. He is the rock of our salvation, refuge, strength, and rest. Having been smitten by the power of God&rsquo;s righteous law, He was cleft, and living water came forth for us to drink. The living water is the Spirit as the ultimate issue of the Triune God. This water quenches our thirst and fully satisfies our being. This is the proper understanding of the picture portrayed in Exodus 17:1-6.</p><h2 class="head2">C. God&rsquo;s Expression</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Negative Aspect of God&rsquo;s<br />Giving of the Law through Moses&mdash;<br />the Law Coming In as an Extra Thing,<br />Being Added Because of Man&rsquo;s Transgressions</h2><p>In bringing the people to Mount Sinai, the mountain of God, it was not God&rsquo;s intention to give them commandments to keep. When God first spoke to the people in Exodus 19, there was no thunder, darkness, or sound of a trumpet. There at the mountain the atmosphere was pleasant and quiet. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles&rsquo; wings, and brought you unto myself.&rdquo; The people had walked out of Egypt, through the wilderness, and to the mountain of God. But God said it was He who had carried them to Himself on the wings of an eagle. After likening Himself to a great eagle, the Lord went on to say that the people would be His personal possession and that they would be unto Him a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (vv. 5-6). This is a word of grace not of law.</p><p>Because the people knew neither God nor themselves, God changed His attitude toward them and also caused a change in the atmosphere. He told Moses that He would come in a thick cloud. He also charged the people to sanctify themselves, to wash their clothes, and to observe the boundary, not to go up into the mount, nor to touch the border of it (Exo. 19:8-12). Then we see how dreadful and terrifying the atmosphere became; &ldquo;and it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled&rdquo; (Exo. 19:16). At this time the children of Israel were afraid to see God; only Moses went up alone (Exo. 20:21). Thus, God&rsquo;s law was given through Moses (John 1:17).</p><p>Therefore, the law came in as an extra thing (Rom. 5:20, Darby); it was added because of transgressions (Gal. 3:19), and was not in the origination of God&rsquo;s economy. It was added while God&rsquo;s economy was proceeding because of man&rsquo;s transgressions, until the seed, Christ, should come to whom God&rsquo;s promise was made.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Positive Aspect of God&rsquo;s Giving of the Law<br />through Moses&mdash;the Law Being God&rsquo;s Testimony</h2><p>Exodus 20 has not been properly and adequately understood by many readers. They thought that this chapter only tells us how the law was given. But the basic concept in this chapter is that God reveals Himself to His people and thus enables them to know what kind of God they were approaching, what kind of God He was with whom they were having fellowship.</p><p>Concerning the matter of law, there is an important principle: the kind of law a person makes expresses the kind of person that one is. A law is always a revelation of what kind of person has enacted that law.</p><p>The first function of the law is not to expose us; it is to reveal God to us. After God brought His people into His presence to have fellowship with Him, to serve Him, to contact Him, to worship Him, and even to feast with Him, He made Himself known to them.</p><p>This revelation, however, is not given directly. Rather, it is given indirectly through the giving of the law. Apparently Exodus 20 is concerned with the giving of the law. Actually this chapter is concerned with the unveiling of God Himself. In decreeing the law, God made Himself known to His people. Through the law, they were able to understand what kind of God He is. The divine legislation is a revelation of God Himself.</p><p>According to Exodus 31:18, the two tablets of stones upon which the Ten Commandments were written were called the &ldquo;two tables of testimony.&rdquo; This indicates that the law is God&rsquo;s testimony. As God&rsquo;s testimony, the law testifies what kind of God our God is. Because the law as God&rsquo;s testimony was placed in the ark, the ark was called the &ldquo;ark of the testimony&rdquo; (Exo. 25:21-22; 26:33-34). Moreover, because the ark was in the tabernacle, the tabernacle was called the &ldquo;tabernacle of testimony&rdquo; (Exo. 38:21; Num. 1:50, 53). The law is the testimony, the ark is the ark of the testimony, and the tabernacle is the tabernacle of testimony.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Manifestation of God&rsquo;s Glory</h2><p>On the fourteenth day of the first month the children of Israel kept the Passover in Egypt. In the third month, they came to Mount Sinai (Exo. 19:1). There they stayed for nine months and received the revelation concerning God and the tabernacle through Moses. For several hundred years they had stayed in the darkness of Egypt, without light and without God&rsquo;s word. Now, however, under the shining of the light, they lived according to God&rsquo;s revelation and built the tabernacle according to the pattern revealed by God. On the first day of the second year, the tabernacle was erected and filled with glory (40:17, 34).</p><p>Exodus 40:17-34 says, &ldquo;And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. And Moses reared up the tabernacle....Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.&rdquo;</p><p>After the completion and erection of God&rsquo;s tabernacle, it was immediately filled with the glory of God. That was the first time in history of a large scale practical expression of God&rsquo;s glory. God&rsquo;s glory is God expressed. That day when the glory of God filled the tabernacle, it was indeed a great matter because God had gained a habitation on the earth. There is nothing more glorious than God getting a dwelling place on the earth.</p><h2 class="head2">D. God&rsquo;s Leading</h2><p>God led His people out of the tyranny of Egypt and into the wilderness. He further brought them up to the mountain and revealed to them His economy. Finally, they built a tabernacle for God and God&rsquo;s glory filled the tabernacle. However, although they had the tabernacle, they still did not have the solid building typified by the temple in the land of Canaan. Therefore, if the children of Israel intended to reach the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s calling, they needed to press on to enter into the good land. The distance from Egypt to Sinai is about one fourth of the distance from Egypt to Canaan. Therefore, God&rsquo;s chosen people had to press on from Sinai until they entered into the land of Canaan, the land flowing with milk and honey.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Education on Mount Sinai</h2><p>From the first day of the first month of the second year, when the tabernacle was set up, to the twentieth day of the second month, when the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai (Num. 10:11-12), within this period of over a month God spoke from within the tabernacle (Lev. 1:1). In Exodus God spoke on Mount Sinai; in Leviticus God spoke in the tabernacle. The latter indicates that God dwelt among His people and was closer to them. God not only redeemed His people, but He also called them to draw near to Himself. The meaning of &ldquo;Leviticus&rdquo; in Hebrew is &ldquo;and He called.&rdquo; Because God is holy, those who draw near to Him must also be holy. He wanted the children of Israel, His redeemed, to be sanctified through the offerings and the blood of the sacrifices and also by the atonement made by the priests, and then to draw near to Him to worship Him through the tabernacle.</p><p>God also wanted His redeemed people to serve Him. Therefore, God spoke to the children of Israel through Moses, instructing them concerning the setting up of the camps, the journeying of the camps (Num. 1, 10), the service in the tabernacle (Num. 3, 4, 8), and the things they were to do in their daily life (Num. 5&mdash;7). All things were to be done according to fixed regulations without any confusion.</p><p>Now the children of Israel became God&rsquo;s army and journeyed on. On one hand, the cloud was leading in front of them (Num. 9:15-23); on the other hand, the tabernacle of God was among them. They were a peculiar people, because their food was different from the food of all the other people on the earth. They were priests serving God, and in their service every one had his own position and duty. However, their flesh still remained.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Temptation in the Wilderness</h2><p>The Passover solved the problem of the sins of the children of Israel, and the crossing of the Red Sea solved the problem of the world. Their flesh, however, had not been dealt with. Therefore, some of them had an evil heart of unbelief in withdrawing from the living God (Heb. 3:12), and they always went astray in heart, not knowing the ways of God. Hence, within the thirty-eight years from the time they left Mount Sinai until the second time they arrived at Kadesh, they offended God and rebelled against God again and again&mdash;altogether eight times. On the third day of their journey at the place of Taberah, they began to murmur (Num. 11:1-3); they murmured again for food (Num. 11:4-35); they spoke against the leader appointed by God (Num. 12); they did not believe that God promised to give them the land of Canaan (Num. 13:1&mdash;14:38); they did not obey God&rsquo;s righteous judgment (Num. 14:39-45); they did not obey the authority and the office arranged by God (Num. 16&mdash;17); they murmured because of thirst (Num. 20:2-13); and they murmured again due to the difficulty in the journey and the shortage of food (Num. 21:5-9). Therefore, God slew them, being disgusted with them, and He swore in His wrath that they would wander in the wilderness for forty years and not be allowed to enter into His rest until those who were after the flesh all fell in the wilderness (1 Cor. 10:18). Eventually only Caleb and Joshua and the new generation entered into Canaan, the good land.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>From Moses to Samuel represents the period of time from God&rsquo;s redemption of Israel, His saving them out of Egypt, to Samuel&rsquo;s ending of the age of the judges and his bringing in of the age of the kings. In Moses, the Bible shows us a complete picture of all God&rsquo;s various work on His redeemed people. God redeemed them out of His condemnation through the Passover and saved them out of the bondage of slavery through His power, thus bringing them into the land of freedom. In this land of freedom, God supplied them with manna from heaven for their food and living water flowing from the rock for their drink, thus changing their constitution. Then He brought them to the place where He appeared to them, giving them the light of the law to expose their sin and weakness and having them build His dwelling place so that they could enjoy His presence and so that He could gain a glorious expression. Finally, He led them through all kinds of trials to prepare them to enter the good land promised by God.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="title"><li>Briefly describe the process of the Passover.</li><li>What does the word Passover mean?</li><li>Why does God&rsquo;s complete salvation include not only the Passover but also the exodus from Egypt and the crossing of the Red Sea?</li><li>What was the purpose of sending the manna from heaven?</li><li>Explain the negative and positive aspects of the law given by God through Moses.</li><li>Briefly describe the education given by God to the children of Israel at Mount Sinai.</li><li>Why did God in His leading allow the children of Israel to be tempted in the wilderness?</li></ol><h1 class="series">TRUTH LESSONS&mdash;LEVEL ONE</h1><h1 class="msg">LESSON TEN</h1><h1 class="title">A KEY VIEW OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="subtitle">FROM MOSES TO SAMUEL</h1><h1 class="subtitle">(2)</h1><ol class="upper-roman" start="2"><li>In Aaron are seen the priesthood and the offerings:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Aaron typifying Christ as the High Priest.</li><li>Ministering in the priestly office to maintain God&rsquo;s testimony.</li><li>The various offerings:<ol class="decimal"><li>The burnt offering.</li><li>The meal offering.</li><li>The peace offering.</li><li>The sin offering.</li><li>The trespass offering.</li><li>The wave offering.</li><li>The heave offering.</li><li>The drink offering.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>In Joshua are seen the destruction of the enemies and the entering into rest:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Destroying the enemies&mdash;the seven tribes in Canaan.</li><li>Entering into rest.</li></ol></li><li>In the age of the judges are seen confusion and revival:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>Confusion.</li><li>Revival.</li></ol></li><li>In Eli is seen the fall of the priesthood.</li><li>In Samuel is seen the voluntarily consecrated Nazarite replacing the ordained priests, ending the age of the judges, and speaking for God as a prophet:<ol class="upper-alpha"><li>The voluntarily consecrated Nazarite replacing the ordained priests.</li><li>Ending the age of the judges.</li><li>Speaking for God as a prophet.</li></ol></li></ol><h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><h2 class="head1">II. IN AARON ARE SEEN<br />THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE OFFERINGS</h2><p>Aaron was the brother of Moses (Exo. 4:14); he was Moses&rsquo; representative, his spokesman to Pharaoh and to the people (Exo. 4:16). While Moses stayed on Mount Sinai for forty days, Aaron made a golden calf for the people and thus brought a great sin upon them (Exo. 32:1-6, 21). But because of Moses&rsquo; petition, they were able to escape God&rsquo;s destruction. Then, following their exodus from Egypt, when the tabernacle was erected, on the first day of the first month of the second year, Aaron and his sons were anointed and sanctified to serve as priests. The period of consecration was seven days (Lev. 8:33). On the eighth day they began to offer the sacrifices (Lev. 9:1-22), thus ministering in their priestly office before God and maintaining God&rsquo;s testimony.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Aaron Typifying Christ as the High Priest</h2><p>Aaron typifies Christ as the High Priest (Heb. 5:1-5). Christ did not glorify Himself to become a High Priest, but He who said to Him, &ldquo;You are My Son, this day I have begotten You.&rdquo; He is One who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses, for He has been tried in all respects like us, yet without sin (Heb. 4:15). He, through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, having found an eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12b).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Ministering in the Priestly Office<br />to Maintain God&rsquo;s Testimony</h2><p>In their priestly service, Aaron and his sons first took care of all the offerings (Lev. 6:8&mdash;7:34). The offerings typify the different aspects of Christ as man&rsquo;s supply. From the standpoint of experience, the trespass offering is first, the sin offering second, the peace offering third, the meal offering fourth, and the burnt offering fifth. Some parts of these offerings are the wave offerings and some parts are the heave offerings (Lev. 7:29-34). The priests had to take care of all these offerings. Aaron offered the sacrifices of the sin offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering for the people, typifying Christ in one aspect as the sin offering for God&rsquo;s people, and in another aspect as the One who offered Himself to God together with all God&rsquo;s people to live a life for God, and now leads them to live in Him for the mutual enjoyment of God and man in peace, and for the maintaining of God&rsquo;s testimony.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Various Offerings</h2><p>As fallen sinners we are under five conditions: we do not live for God, we do not have a proper and balanced living and conduct, we have problems with God and are not able to maintain peace with God, we have the sinful nature, and we commit sinful deeds. Because of our fivefold situation, Christ became the offerings to solve and to meet these five needs.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Burnt Offering</h2><p>The burnt offering signifies that Christ&rsquo;s living on earth was absolutely for God. He offered Himself without blemish and spot to God to do God&rsquo;s will and became a sweet savor to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire. As a result, we are also accepted by God through our union with Him (Lev. 1:1-17; Heb. 10:5-7; Phil. 2:5-8).</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Meal Offering</h2><p>The meal offering signifies that Christ&rsquo;s human living was so proper, even, tender, fine, balanced, pure, and sinless. He became a sweet savor for God&rsquo;s enjoyment and also the food for our satisfaction (Lev. 2:1-16; Matt. 11:29; 12:19-20; Heb. 4:15).</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Peace Offering</h2><p>The peace offering signifies that Christ became the peace and the fellowship between God and us by shedding His blood and dying for us. On the one hand, He is a sweet savor as food to God; on the other hand, He is our nourishment, enabling us to enjoy Christ with God and to have peace and fellowship with God in Christ. In this way both God and man are satisfied (Col. 1:20-22; Rom. 5:1; 2 Cor. 5:18-20).</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Sin Offering</h2><p>The sin offering signifies that Christ was made sin for us that through His death on the cross sin might be condemned. Thus He dealt with the sin in our nature that we might be forgiven by God in our nature (Lev. 4:1-23; 2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3).</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Trespass Offering</h2><p>The trespass offering signifies that Christ bore our sins in His own body and was judged by God on the cross to deal with our sinful deeds that we may be forgiven in our sinful conduct (Lev. 5:1-19; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18; Isa. 53:5-6, 10-11).</p><p>In addition to the five basic offerings, there are three more offerings.</p><h2 class="head3">6. The Wave Offering</h2><p>The breast of the sacrifice was offered as the wave offering (Lev. 10:15). The breast denotes God&rsquo;s love. Waving implies resurrection. The wave offering signifies the resurrected Christ in love.</p><h2 class="head3">7. The Heave Offering</h2><p>The shoulder of the sacrifice was offered as the heave offering (Exo. 29:27). The shoulder is the strength for movement; hence, the heave offering signifies the powerful Christ in ascension.</p><h2 class="head3">8. The Drink Offering</h2><p>This is supplementary to the five basic offerings (Num. 15:1-10; 28:7-10). In the drink offering, wine was offered. The drink offering signifies Christ as the enjoyment of the offerer; this kind of offering enables the offerer to be filled with Christ as the heavenly wine, and even to become the wine to be offered to God (Phil. 2:17; 2 Tim. 4:6).</p><h2 class="head1">III. IN JOSHUA ARE SEEN THE DESTRUCTION<br />OF THE ENEMIES AND THE ENTERING INTO REST</h2><p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s calling was not only to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt, the land of bondage, but also to bring them into Canaan, the land flowing with milk and honey (Exo. 3:8, 10, 17). In typology, to bring the children of Israel into the good land signifies the bringing of man into Christ, the all-inclusive One typified by the good land. Today Christ is the good land flowing with milk and honey.</p><p>The children of Israel were redeemed through the Passover, delivered out of the tyranny of Egypt, and brought to the mountain of God to receive the revelation concerning the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God. Due to their unbelief, however, most of them fell in the wilderness and were not able to reach the goal (Heb. 3:8, 10, 17). Even Moses, because he struck the rock twice in Kadesh (Num. 20:11) and thus disobeyed God&rsquo;s economy, was not allowed to bring the children of Israel into the good land (Num. 20:12). Eventually he died in the wilderness (Deut. 34:5).</p><p>God spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses&rsquo; minister, to rise up and cross over Jordan with all the people to the land that He would give to them as their inheritance (Josh. 1:2, 6). Joshua 11:23 says, &ldquo;Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">A. Defeating the Enemies&mdash;<br />the Seven Tribes in Canaan</h2><p>There were seven tribes in the land of Canaan: the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites (Deut. 7:1). After the children of Israel entered into the good land under the leadership of Joshua, they defeated the seven tribes who were the enemies occupying the land. These enemies typify the rulers and the authorities in the air (Eph. 6:12), who try to frustrate us from the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ. The Egyptians were dealt with when the children of Israel ate the Passover lamb. But after they entered into the good land, they were not fighting with the Egyptians but with the many nations of the land. In type, these nations refer to the evil forces of darkness, the evil authorities, the rulers, and the authorities of the air. These usurping forces in the heavenlies always try to prevent us from enjoying the riches of the all-inclusive Christ. Hence, in order to enjoy the all-inclusive riches of Christ, we must defeat the rulers, the principalities, the powers, and the authorities in the heavenlies.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Entering into Rest</h2><p>According to the Bible, the real rest comes when man expresses God and represents God for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. When the children of Israel entered into the good land under Joshua&rsquo;s leadership, they defeated the enemy and settled down to live. Then they built the temple and thus were able to express and represent God. When God is expressed and represented, both God and man are satisfied. This is the real rest.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. IN THE AGE OF THE JUDGES ARE SEEN<br />CONFUSION AND REVIVAL</h2><p>From the time the children of Israel left Egypt to the time of the prophet Samuel when David was king of the whole nation of Israel (2 Sam. 5:3-4), it was about 450 years (Acts 13:17-20; Judg. 11:26; 1 Kings 6:1). A major section of this period may be called the age of the judges. During this age, the children of Israel could not utterly drive out and destroy the seven tribes in Canaan. Consequently, they gradually forsook God, followed the customs of the nations, had mixed marriages with the nations, and worshipped other gods. Therefore, God delivered them into the hands of the nations according to His warnings. But whenever they repented, God would listen to their prayers and would deliver them through the hand of a judge. The children of Israel would forsake God, but they would then repent and God would deliver them. But eventually they would forsake God again. This cycle was repeated, as many as seven times.</p><p>Thirteen judges are mentioned in the book of Judges: Othniel (3:9), Ehud (3:15), Shamgar (3:31), Deborah (4:4), Barak (4:6), Gideon (6:11), Tola (10:1), Jair (10:3), Jephthah (12:7), Ibzan (12:8), Elon (12:11), Abdon (12:13), and Samson (15:20). Besides these, in the book of Judges there were other judges whose names are not mentioned, such as Eli (1 Sam. 4:18), Samuel (1 Sam. 7:13), Joel and Abiah (1 Sam. 8:2).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Confusion</h2><p>After the children of Israel possessed the land as their inheritance, they did not obey God&rsquo;s word to utterly drive out and destroy all the seven tribes inhabiting Canaan (Judg. 1:27-36). As a result, the children of Israel dwelled among them, took their daughters to be their wives, gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods, thus doing evil in the sight of the Lord. The children of Israel forsook the Lord God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they followed the gods of the people that were around them. They bowed themselves down to them, and provoked Jehovah to anger. So God delivered them into the hands of spoilers, and He sold them into the hands of their enemies so that they could no longer stand. Wherever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil (2:11-15).</p><p>Even though God raised up judges to deliver them out of the hands of those who spoiled them, they would not hearken, but they defiled themselves with other gods and bowed down to them; they turned quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked. They corrupted themselves more than their fathers and did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way (2:16-19).</p><p>The age of the judges may be considered the darkest period in the history of Israel. At that time, among the children of Israel there were rebellions against God, idolatry (Judg. 17&mdash;18), infighting (Judg. 9), hostility and controversy among the tribes (Judg. 20&mdash;21), fornication (Judg. 19), filthiness, brutal killings, and all manner of evil doing. Every man did that which was right in his own eyes (Judg. 17:6; 21:25). It was also a period of tragedy. The unbelief of the children of Israel caused them to wander for forty years so that even their carcasses fell in the wilderness (Heb. 3:7, 19). But their forsaking God and their idolatry after they entered the land issued in a situation of defeat and tragedy that lasted not merely forty years, but ten times forty years.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Revival</h2><p>The children of Israel forsook God repeatedly, followed the nations&rsquo; customs, and bowed themselves down to other gods, but as soon as they repented, God listened to their cries, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies through the judges. In God&rsquo;s grace and faithfulness the children of Israel needed only to repent from their hearts and to cry to God; then God would listen to their prayers and deliver them. As many as seven times, they rebelled, were enslaved, repented, and were delivered.</p><p>Some of the judges raised up by God were born of poor and humble families, such as Gideon, who was poor in Manasseh and the least in his father&rsquo;s house (Judg. 6:15). Some were women, such as Deborah (Judg. 4:4). Some were like Jephthah, the son of a harlot (Judg. 11:1). Some were like Samson, who was a voluntarily consecrated Nazarite (Judg. 13:3-5). However, because Jehovah&rsquo;s Spirit had come upon them (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 13:25; 14:6, 19; 15:14), they could prevail against their strong enemies and could be deliverers to the children of Israel. As it is said, &ldquo;Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts&rdquo; (Zech. 4:6).</p><p>God raised up judges for the sake of the children of Israel, and God was with the judges. God delivered them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judges were present. This continued until Samuel was raised up by God. Then the age of the judges was ended.</p><h2 class="head1">V. IN ELI IS SEEN THE FALL OF THE PRIESTHOOD</h2><p>Eli was both a priest and a judge (1 Sam. 4:18; 1:9). When God&rsquo;s ark was in Shiloh, he ministered to God in the priestly office. He blessed Hannah, Samuel&rsquo;s mother, that she might have a son (1 Sam. 1:17). He also taught the child Samuel how to minister to the Lord (1 Sam. 2:11).</p><p>Eli had two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, and both were wicked. They both were priests but they did not know the Lord. Their custom with the people was that, when any man offered a sacrifice, the priest&rsquo;s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand, and he thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. Because they abhorred the offerings of the Lord, their sin was very great before Him (1 Sam. 2:12-17), to such an extent that He would slay them (1 Sam. 2:25).</p><p>But Eli allowed his two sons to make themselves fat with the best of all the offerings of God&rsquo;s people, for he honored his sons more than God (1 Sam. 2:29). He knew that his sons defiled themselves, but he did not restrain them (1 Sam. 3:13). Therefore God swore to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli&rsquo;s house would never be cleansed with sacrifice or offerings (1 Sam. 3:14).</p><p>When the children of Israel went out to fight against the Philistines, God allowed His ark to be taken, and the two sons of Eli were slain (1 Sam. 4:11). When Eli heard that the ark of the Lord was taken, he fell from the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke and he died (1 Sam. 4:18). From the time God established Samuel as a prophet (1 Sam. 3:20) until the death of Eli, the priests no longer held the important position but were replaced by the prophets.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. IN SAMUEL IS SEEN<br />THE VOLUNTARILY CONSECRATED NAZARITE<br />REPLACING THE ORDAINED PRIESTS,<br />ENDING THE AGE OF THE JUDGES,<br />AND SPEAKING FOR GOD AS A PROPHET</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Voluntarily Consecrated Nazarite<br />Replacing the Ordained Priests</h2><p>The Lord had given Moses a supplement in chapter six of Numbers. This supplement was His special provision against the degradation of the priesthood. The Lord had appointed and ordained only the house of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi, to be the priests. The rest of the Levites who served in the tabernacle were not the priests.</p><p>God&rsquo;s intention had been to make the whole nation of Israel a kingdom of priests; however, through Israel&rsquo;s failure, the Lord chose the Levites as a tribe of priests to replace a nation of priests in Israel. But not all of the tribe of Levi were chosen by the Lord. Only those of the house of Aaron were to be the priests. But the house of Aaron eventually came to the point of being fully and utterly fallen at the time of Eli&rsquo;s sons (1 Sam. 2:12-17). However, the Lord foresaw the situation. Besides His ordination of the house of Aaron as priests, He had made a supplement in the sixth chapter of Numbers. This supplement was given in case there should be an inadequacy in the ordained priests. When the house of Aaron fell, this supplement was put into practical use.</p><p>The principle of the Nazarite is voluntary consecration. It is not by being appointed, ordained, or even chosen by the Lord, but by voluntarily consecrating yourself to Him. At the time of Eli, the Lord was really poor as far as the priesthood was concerned; so Hannah lent Samuel to the Lord. She told the Lord that if He would give her a son, then she would lend him to the Lord (1 Sam. 1:11, &ldquo;give...unto&rdquo; in the original has the meaning of &ldquo;lend...to&rdquo;). When the situation is abnormal, the Lord becomes poor with respect to His administration, and there is the need for someone to voluntarily lend himself to the Lord.</p><p>Samuel was of the tribe of Levi (1 Chron. 6:33-38), of Mount Ephraim (1 Sam. 1:1-2). He was not of the house of Aaron. But he became a priest by being consecrated, separated, and lent to God. Samuel became a priest by coming through the side door, not by coming through the main entrance. He became a priest according to the supplement provided in Numbers 6, not according to an appointment or ordination. By the principle of the Nazarite he became a voluntarily consecrated person to replace the ordained priest.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Ending the Age of the Judges</h2><p>Samuel was not only a priest, but also a judge. The judges were in the line of authority. He was a person both in the priesthood and in the kingship. In such a position he ended the age of the judges and turned the age into the age of the kingdom.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Speaking for God as a Prophet</h2><p>Samuel was also a prophet, one who spoke for God. First Samuel 3:19-21 says, &ldquo;And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord...for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.&rdquo;</p><p>With Samuel there was the priesthood, the kingship, and the prophethood. Through him the age of degradation was turned into the age of the kingdom. Samuel could be so much used by God simply because he came into God&rsquo;s administration through the principle of the Nazarite and became a voluntarily consecrated person.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>In the section from Moses to Samuel, Aaron is the second important figure. In him we see the priesthood and all the offerings. Afterwards, in Joshua we see God&rsquo;s power destroying the enemies in the land of Canaan and bringing His chosen people into the rest of the good land. Following this is the age of the judges where we see the confusion caused by God&rsquo;s chosen people forsaking God and the revival gained by their turning back to Him. Next, we see the fall of the priesthood in Eli. Finally, in Samuel we see a person voluntarily consecrated as a Nazarite, replacing the ordained priests, ending the age of the judges, speaking for God as a prophet (prophesying for God), and bringing in the age of the kings.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>How did Aaron minister in the priestly office?</li><li>Give a brief description of each of the five basic offerings and their meanings.</li><li>What is the significance of Joshua leading the children of Israel to destroy the seven tribes in Canaan?</li><li>What is the rest?

IN BOAZ IS SEEN ONE VALUING<br />THE GOD-GIVEN BIRTHRIGHT AND USHERING IN<br />THE KING WHO ESTABLISHED THE KINGDOM&mdash;DAVID</h2><p>In the book of Ruth, Boaz typifies Christ and Ruth typifies the church. This book shows us how Boaz redeemed both Ruth and her birthright. The birthright included a double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship, that is, the right and position to enjoy Christ fully with the privileges to be a priest to bring man to God and a king to bring God to man. Ruth was Naomi&rsquo;s daughter-in-law, and both had lost their birthright due to poverty. According to God&rsquo;s ordination, the recovery of one&rsquo;s birthright required the redemptive effort of a kinsman (Lev. 25:25).</p><p>Boaz treasured the God-given birthright. He was not only concerned for his own birthright, but also for that of others. He paid a price to redeem his kinsman&rsquo;s inheritance and married his widow (Ruth 4:1-17). It was due to his compassion on the poor and weak Ruth and his redemption of her birthright that David, the king who established the kingdom, was brought in.</p><h2 class="head1">II. IN DAVID IS SEEN ONE DOING GOD&rsquo;S WILL<br />AND ONE AFTER GOD&rsquo;S HEART,<br />CONQUERING THE ENEMIES<br />TO ESTABLISH GOD&rsquo;S KINGDOM<br />FOR THE BUILDING OF GOD&rsquo;S TEMPLE</h2><p>David was the last in the age of the patriarchs and the first in the age of the kings. He ended one age and began another. He was the landmark between two ages. Because the kingdom and the kingship began with David, he was the only one to be called &ldquo;the king&rdquo; in the genealogy of Christ in the Gospel of Matthew.</p><p>David, being the eighth son of his father, was chosen and anointed by God (1 Sam. 16:10-13). The number eight signifies resurrection. As the eighth son, David&rsquo;s selection by God denotes his union with Christ in resurrection. He was also one who was after God&rsquo;s heart, establishing God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Doing God&rsquo;s Will</h2><p>Acts 13:36 says, &ldquo;For David indeed, when he had served his own generation by the counsel of God, fell asleep....&rdquo; This shows that David&rsquo;s reign was according to the will of God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being after God&rsquo;s Heart</h2><p>David was a man after God&rsquo;s heart (Acts 13:22). God sent Samuel to tell Saul that He had found another to replace him, for He had found Himself a man after His own heart (1 Sam. 13:14). Apart from the sin he committed because of the wife of Uriah, David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord (1 Kings 15:5).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Conquering the Enemies</h2><p>The children of Israel fought their way step by step into Canaan. After they crossed the river Jordan, beginning from Jericho, they captured the land of Canaan battle by battle and city by city. The warfare did not end until David&rsquo;s time. It was after David became king that all the enemies of the land were subdued (1 Chron. 22:18).</p><h2 class="head2">D. Establishing God&rsquo;s Kingdom</h2><p>After David became king and subdued the surrounding enemies, the kingdom of God was established. From the time when God called Abraham to the end of the age of the judges, the nation that God promised to make of Abraham (Gen. 12:2) had never come into being. This was because the land had not been completely possessed and the adversaries destroyed. Only when God found David the son of Jesse, a man after His own heart, one who fought for God&rsquo;s interest and conquered the enemies, was the kingdom of God established.</p><h2 class="head2">E. For the Building of God&rsquo;s Temple</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Caring for God&rsquo;s Ark</h2><p>When God&rsquo;s tabernacle was erected, it became the center of the lives of God&rsquo;s people. Whether in encampment, in movement, in worship, or in battle, the tabernacle was their center. The ark, in turn, was the center of the tabernacle.</p><p>Unfortunately, such a condition did not remain very long before God&rsquo;s people fell and became desolate. The book of 1 Samuel records how the children of Israel were defeated by their enemies to such an extent that even the ark of God was captured (1 Sam. 4:10-11). The captured ark eventually ended up not only in the land of the Philistines but in an idol&rsquo;s temple. However, God exercised His divine power to preserve the ark and caused the Philistines to return it to the people of God. The Israelites, instead of taking it back to the tabernacle, moved it to the house of Abinadab (1 Sam. 5&mdash;7). Thereafter it was transported to the house of Obed-edom (2 Sam. 6:1-10). Later, David brought God&rsquo;s ark to the city of David, that is, Mount Zion, a high hill within the city of Jerusalem. It was there that David pitched a tabernacle for God (2 Sam. 6:12-19).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Preparing Both the Materials and the Site<br />for the Building of God&rsquo;s Temple</h2><p>David not only cared for God&rsquo;s ark, but he was also concerned for the matter of God&rsquo;s habitation. Although he prepared a tabernacle for the ark according to his own desire, he realized that this was only a temporary arrangement. He longed to build a temple for God. In Psalm 132, David swore unto God, saying &ldquo;Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for the Lord, a habitation for the mighty God of Jacob&rdquo; (vv. 3-5). He then prayed, &ldquo;Arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength&rdquo; (v. 8).</p><p>Although it was in David&rsquo;s heart to build a temple for God, God told David through the prophet Nathan that, in spite of his desire to do so, the time had not yet come. The enemies were not yet fully subdued and the land was not completely at rest. God then promised him a son, Solomon, who would build the temple for God (2 Sam. 7; 1 Chron. 17). Moreover, God revealed to David by His Spirit the pattern of the temple. Throughout his lifetime, David endeavored, under difficult circumstances, to prepare materials for the house of Jehovah (1 Chron. 22:13-15; 29:1-5). He bought from Oman the Jebusite the threshing floor of Oman (also called the threshing floor of Araunah) as the site for the temple (1 Chron. 21:18-31; 2 Sam. 24:18-25).</p><h2 class="head1">III. IN SOLOMON ARE SEEN<br />THE ISSUE OF GOD&rsquo;S FORGIVENESS<br />AND THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Issue of God&rsquo;s Forgiveness</h2><p>David committed only one evil in his whole life: he murdered Uriah for lust to marry his wife Bathsheba. In a single act, he committed the two great sins of fornication and murder. God intentionally sent the prophet Nathan to rebuke and condemn him (2 Sam. 12:1-12). After he was condemned, he repented and confessed to God. Psalm 51 is David&rsquo;s psalm of repentance. Following David&rsquo;s repentance, God forgave him and he begat Solomon (2 Sam. 12:24). Thus, Solomon is the fruit of man&rsquo;s transgression and repentance along with God&rsquo;s forgiveness.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Building of the Temple</h2><p>David&rsquo;s intention to build the temple for the Lord was acceptable to God. However, as he was a man of war and the land was not yet at peace, God prohibited him from doing so. God instead promised that his seed who was to succeed him would build a house for God&rsquo;s name (2 Sam. 7:12-13; 1 Chron. 28:2-3, 6). God further showed David the pattern of the temple by His Spirit. Before David died, he had already given the pattern to Solomon his son (1 Chron. 28:11-19).</p><p>The first thing Solomon did after he ascended to the throne of David was to worship God and sacrifice to God at the tabernacle in Gibeon. During the night, God in His kindness appeared to Solomon in a dream to ask what he desired. Solomon did not ask for riches and longevity for himself, but only for wisdom to rule God&rsquo;s people. God therefore answered him and gave him wisdom and understanding. When Solomon awoke, he left Gibeon and returned to Jerusalem at once to stand before God&rsquo;s ark to offer burnt offerings and peace offerings (1 Kings 3:4-15). This shows us that upon receiving wisdom from God, Solomon realized that a tabernacle without the ark is empty, having only an appearance and not being of much value. Therefore, he immediately left the empty tabernacle in Gibeon and went back to the ark which was at Jerusalem. He also understood that while the tabernacle without the ark was but an empty shell, the ark without the tabernacle was also abnormal. A short time thereafter, he built the temple according to the pattern seen by his father David. The temple became the proper and solid dwelling place God had desired. At this juncture, not only did God secure a kingdom to demonstrate His authority, but He also gained a temple to manifest His glory.</p><p>Both David and Solomon occupied special places in the building of the temple. The former prepared the building materials and the site, while the latter finished the building work. Both David and Solomon typify Christ. David typifies the suffering, fighting, and crucified Christ. As David prepared building materials in hardship, Christ also redeemed us through suffering and in death to prepare us as building materials. Solomon typifies the resurrected Christ, including His ascension and His second coming. As Solomon finished the building, Christ is also building His church in His resurrection until His return.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. IN REHOBOAM IS SEEN THE RESULT OF THE FALL<br />OF ONE WHO HAD OBTAINED GRACE (SOLOMON)&mdash;<br />THE DIVISION AND CONFUSION OF GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Fall of Solomon</h2><p>During Solomon&rsquo;s reign, the temple was built in Jerusalem. First Kings 8 tells us that God&rsquo;s glory filled the temple (vv. 10-11). The age of the building of the temple was a golden age in the history of Israel. When the work of the building of the temple was completed, Solomon offered a marvelous prayer. However, not long after that, in 1 Kings 11 Solomon&rsquo;s heart was turned from Jehovah, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice, and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods (vv. 9-10). And Solomon did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and did not follow Jehovah fully, as did David his father (v. 6). Besides marrying the daughter of Pharaoh, Solomon loved many other Gentile women. He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines. In his old age, these Gentile wives turned away his heart after other gods, and for their sake he rebuilt high places for the Gentile gods, which places Moses commanded the Israelites to destroy after they entered the land of Canaan. Deuteronomy 12:2-3 says, &ldquo;Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: and ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.&rdquo; After the destruction of these things, the Israelites were to come to the unique place of God&rsquo;s choice (Deut. 12:5, 11). Moses commanded this in order to preserve the oneness of God&rsquo;s people, for he knew well that the unique place of God&rsquo;s choice and the destruction of places of pagan worship had much to do with the people&rsquo;s fate before God. If they were faithful to destroy the Gentile worship centers and come to the one place of God&rsquo;s choosing, then they were doing what was right in God&rsquo;s eyes. If they would not obey this commandment, they were doing evil in the sight of God. After the Israelites entered into the good land, they did in fact destroy the high places and the names of idols. As a result, they conquered and subdued that land, ushered in God&rsquo;s kingdom, and built God&rsquo;s temple.</p><p>At Solomon&rsquo;s time, however, the destroyed items were brought back again. The high places, the pillars, the wooden symbols, and graven images were all recovered. The very king who had built the temple according to God&rsquo;s desire actually took the lead to build high places (1 Kings 11:6-8). The very king of unsurpassed wisdom took Gentile women as wives and followed them in idolatry. This offended God and resulted in the division and disorder of God&rsquo;s people.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Division of the Kingdom</h2><p>After Solomon died, his son Rehoboam succeeded him. According to His word, God rent the kingdom from his son, leaving only one tribe for him (1 Kings 11:9-13). The Israelites rebelled against the house of David and made Jeroboam king over them, and none followed the house of David except the tribe of Judah (1 Kings 12:19-20).</p><h2 class="head1">V. IN JEROBOAM ARE SEEN<br />THE ILL RESULTS OF ONE WHO CAUSED DIVISION<br />AMONG GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Setting Up High Places to Establish<br />Another Center of Worship,<br />Thus Bringing About Division</h2><p>After Jeroboam became king, he wanted to protect his throne and thought that if the Israelites would go up to Jerusalem to worship God, the kingdom could still return to the house of David. Due to his ambition, Jeroboam made two golden calves and said to the people, &ldquo;It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt&rdquo; (1 Kings 12:28). Then he set the calves, one in Bethel and the other in Dan (1 Kings 12:29). This caused the people to sin, for they went to worship before the golden calf in Dan. Jeroboam was indifferent to God&rsquo;s unique chosen place and established another worship center because of his ambition. This damaged the ground of oneness and produced division among God&rsquo;s people. Moreover, he ordained a feast, which was of his own heart, in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that was in Judah, even making priests of the lowest of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi (1 Kings 12:31-33).</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Tragic End of One Who Caused Division</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The House of Jeroboam<br />Being Cut Off from the Earth</h2><p>Since Jeroboam did evil in making other gods and molten images and in causing the people to sin, God was angry with him and said, &ldquo;I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every man-child...and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweepeth away dung, till it be all gone&rdquo; (1 Kings 14:10 ASV). In the second year of the reign of Jeroboam&rsquo;s son Nadab over Israel, Baasha of Issachar conspired against him and killed him and reigned in his stead. And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him (1 Kings 15:25-29).</p><h2 class="head3">2. Destruction and Captivity</h2><p>The Bible mentions over twenty times &ldquo;the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.&rdquo; These sins caused him and his house to be eradicated from the earth, and even caused the children of Israel to be delivered to their enemies and carried to faraway places. As God spoke through the prophet Ahijah, &ldquo;For the Lord shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river....And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam&rdquo; (1 Kings 14:15-16). In 2 Kings 17, because the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did, and departed not from them, Jehovah removed them out of His sight. Thus, Israel was carried away from their own land to Assyria (vv. 22-23).</p><h2 class="head1">VI. IN THE DIVIDED KINGDOMS OF JUDAH AND ISRAEL<br />ARE SEEN THE RISE AND FALL OF THE KINGS<br />BEING DEPENDENT ON<br />THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD,<br />AND GOD&rsquo;S FORBEARANCE, ENDURANCE,<br />AND RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT TOWARD THEM</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Kings of Judah</h2><p>There were nineteen kings of Judah from Rehoboam to Zedekiah (1 Kings 12&mdash;2 Kings 17). Athaliah is omitted (2 Kings 11:3) because when she usurped the throne, Joash continued the lineage of the house of David to be king in the house of Jehovah. Eight of the kings were proper, doing what was right in the eyes of Jehovah. They removed the idols made by their fathers, and the high places were taken away; but the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places (2 Kings 12:3; 14:3-4; 15:3-4, 34-35), except in the times of Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:4; 2 Chron. 31:1). They never fully returned to the unique place of God&rsquo;s choice to serve God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Kings of Israel</h2><p>There were also nineteen kings of Israel from Jeroboam to Hoshea (1 Kings 12&mdash;2 Kings 17). Besides Jehu (2 Kings 10:30-31), who did the Lord&rsquo;s will, but not wholeheartedly, none of the kings were good. In God&rsquo;s judgment pronounced against them, over twenty times it was mentioned that they &ldquo;departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin.&rdquo; The sins of Jeroboam were the making of the golden calves, the high places, and the temples, the ordaining of ones who were not Levites as priests, and the establishing of his own feasts. These sins provoked God to anger and led to the destruction of the nation and captivity.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Key to Their Rise and Fall</h2><p>The rise and fall of the kingdom of God&rsquo;s people depended on their relationship with God. When they feared God, their nation prospered, and when they departed from God, their nation declined. Whenever God perceived that the kings and the people rebelled against Him and left Him to serve the abominable Gentile idols, He was always kind and enduring. He would send His prophets to warn them in hope of their repentance and return to Himself. It was when the people failed to listen that God&rsquo;s righteous judgment would come upon them.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. IN AHAB IS SEEN THE RESULT<br />OF TOLERATING THE HARLOT JEZEBEL&mdash;<br />THE DEVASTATION OF HIS HOUSE</h2><p>Jezebel, who came from the Gentile land of Sidon, was the wife of Ahab the king of Israel. King Ahab allowed Jezebel to persecute those who worshipped Jehovah, lead the people to worship Baal (1 Kings 16:30-32), kill the prophets of Jehovah (1 Kings 18:13), and build the house of Baal. Ahab was also influenced by Jezebel to serve Baal and did more to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him (1 Kings 16:33). He strongly promoted idol worship among the children of Israel, he determined to slay the Lord&rsquo;s prophet Elijah, and he tolerated Jezebel&rsquo;s murder of Naboth because Naboth would not give him the inheritance of his fathers. He was the head of the evils of Israel in those days. The Bible says, &ldquo;But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel&rdquo; (1 Kings 21:25-26). God therefore sent the prophet Elijah to Ahab, saying, &ldquo;I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel....And of Jezebel also spake Jehovah, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel&rdquo; (1 Kings 21:21-23 ASV).</p><p>When Jehoram, son of Ahab, was king, Jehu smote Jehoram with an arrow, and commanded people to throw Jezebel down from the window until her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses. All the seventy sons of Ahab in Samaria and all who remained of his house were also slain, fulfilling the words of the prophet Elijah (2 Kings 9:14&mdash;10:17).</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. IN HOSHEA IS SEEN THE RESULT<br />OF NOT LEAVING THE EVILS OF JEROBOAM&mdash;<br />DESTRUCTION AND CAPTIVITY</h2><p>Hoshea, the last king of Israel, did evil in the eyes of the Lord. The king of Assyria attacked him, shut him up, and bound him in prison. Later, he took over Samaria and carried Israel away into Assyria, which is today&rsquo;s Syria. He placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan and in the cities of the Medes (2 Kings 17:4-6). All this was due to Israel&rsquo;s sinning the sins of Jeroboam and being reluctant to depart from them. They refused to obey Jehovah&rsquo;s exhortation through the prophets to leave their evil ways. Being stiff-necked, they turned away from Jehovah their God and all His commandments and made for themselves two images of calves, made an Asherah, worshipped the heavenly bodies, served Baal, and did what was evil in Jehovah&rsquo;s eyes, provoking His anger. Jehovah therefore resented them and chased them away from His presence (2 Kings 17:7-18). Just as they rejected God, God eventually also rejected them.</p><h2 class="head1">IX. IN JECONIAH AND ZEDEKIAH IS SEEN<br />THE RESULT OF STUBBORNNESS AND REFUSAL<br />TO REPENT&mdash;ALSO DESTRUCTION AND CAPTIVITY</h2><p>The judgment Israel received from God and their captivity should have been a strong warning to the kingdom of Judah. Instead of being forewarned, the people were wholly indifferent and continued in what was evil in the eyes of Jehovah. After Jeconiah (also known as Coniah&mdash;Jer. 22:24, and Jehoiachin&mdash; 2 Chron. 36:8-10; Jer. 37:1), the king of Judah, was carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon with the king&rsquo;s mother, the king&rsquo;s wives, his officers, and the mighty of the land (2 Kings 24:15), he was succeeded by Zedekiah his brother. Zedekiah still did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet who spoke from the mouth of Jehovah. He stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning to Jehovah, the God of Israel. Moreover, all the chief priests and the people transgressed much, mocking the messengers of God, despising their words, misusing His prophets, until the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against His people without remedy (2 Chron. 36:9-16).</p><p>So Jehovah placed them in the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Chaldea, who took all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Jehovah, to Babylon. The Chaldeans then burned the house of God and broke down the walls of Jerusalem and burned all the palaces with fire. All of this fulfilled the words of the prophet Jeremiah, &ldquo;For as long as she [the land] lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years&rdquo; (2 Chron. 36:17-21).</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>From David to the captivity covers the period from the building up of the kingdom of Israel by David to the loss of the kingdom and the carrying away of the children of Israel into captivity caused by the corruption of the kings of Israel. David who established the kingdom of Israel was a descendant of Boaz. In Boaz, we see a person who valued the birthright given by God and brought in the king who established the kingdom. In David, we see a man who did God&rsquo;s will, a man after God&rsquo;s heart who conquered the enemies and established God&rsquo;s kingdom for the building of God&rsquo;s temple. Afterwards, in Solomon we see the result of God&rsquo;s grace in forgiving David&rsquo;s transgression and the building of the temple. Next, in Rehoboam, we see that the fall of Solomon, one who had obtained grace, resulted in the division and confusion among God&rsquo;s people. Following this, in Jeroboam, we see that the ill results of one who caused division among God&rsquo;s people were the devastation of the house and the destruction of the kingdom. Later, in the kings of Judah and Israel we see that their rising and falling depended upon their relationship with God and on God&rsquo;s forbearance, patience, and righteous judgment toward them; since they did not repent even at the end, their kingdom was destroyed and they were carried away into captivity.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>What blessings did the birthright include?</li><li>State David&rsquo;s desire and action toward the building of God&rsquo;s temple.</li><li>What were the reasons for Solomon&rsquo;s downfall?

THE PROPHET DURING THE CAPTIVITY<br />AND IN CAPTIVITY&mdash;JEREMIAH</h2><p>Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah the priest, was born in Anathoth (Jer. 1:1). He was born as a priest and was called to be a prophet in the thirteenth year of King Josiah. He spoke for the Lord until the captivity of Israel (Jer. 1:2-3, 5-7). Among all the prophets, he was the one who suffered the most persecution. Except for a few of the kings, leaders, priests, and people, everyone was against him and hated him. The false prophets, who assumed to speak in God&rsquo;s name, especially lied about and contradicted his prophecy. Finally, Azariah and Johanan and those who were close to Egypt forced him to go to Egypt (Jer. 43:2-7). In Jeremiah&rsquo;s ministry, he rebuked the kings and the people for their sins and warned them that unless they repented they would be carried into captivity and their nation would be destroyed. He wept for God&rsquo;s people when he saw that they refused in their stiff-neckedness to repent and that they eventually lost their country. His writings include Jeremiah and Lamentations.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Rebuking the Kings and the People<br />for Their Sins</h2><h2 class="head3">1. Forsaking God and Disobeying His Word</h2><p>Jeremiah 2:13 says, &ldquo;For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s people forsook God, the fountain of the living water. This was not only a loss to them but also a great sin which became the main factor of their fall.</p><p>Jeremiah 9:13 says, &ldquo;They have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein.&rdquo; Because the people forsook God, they also disobeyed His word.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Worshipping Idols and Committing Fornication</h2><p>Jeremiah 1:16 says, &ldquo;Touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.&rdquo; Having forsaken God and having disobeyed His voice, they burned incense unto other gods, who actually were not God, and worshipped the works of their own hands, making the idols their gods.</p><p>Jeremiah 11:13 says, &ldquo;For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s people had truly fallen into a very wicked situation. Their false gods were as many as their cities; the shameful altars of Baal were as many as the streets in Jerusalem.</p><p>The people of Israel were holiness unto the Lord, and the firstfruits of His increase. In the beginning they also had the kindness of their youth, and the love of their espousals unto God (Jer. 2:2-3). But they backslid, forsook God, and turned to the false gods; thus, they committed spiritual fornication. They committed adultery in every high mountain and under every green tree, with stones and with stocks, so that even the land was defiled (Jer. 3:6-9).</p><h2 class="head3">3. Speaking Lies, Deceiving Others,<br />and Committing Iniquity</h2><p>When God&rsquo;s people fell into the condition of forsaking God, disobeying God&rsquo;s word, and committing adultery in worshipping idols, they spontaneously spoke lies, deceived others, and committed iniquity. They bent their tongues like their bow for lies. They taught their tongue to speak lies, and wearied themselves to commit iniquity (Jer. 9:3, 5). They were turned back to the iniquity of their forefathers, who refused to hear the words of God (Jer. 11:10).</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Kings Scattering God&rsquo;s People<br />and Not Caring for Them</h2><p>The kings of Israel not only took the lead to do such evil, but also scattered the people and did not care for them. &ldquo;Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them&rdquo; (Jer. 23:2).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Warning concerning<br />Captivity and Destruction</h2><p>Jeremiah, on one hand, rebuked the kings and the people for their sins and wanted them to repent; on the other hand, he warned them that they would be taken into captivity, that their nation would be destroyed, and that the cities of Judah and Jerusalem would become desolate.</p><p>In chapter one Jeremiah began to warn the backsliding people of the evil that would be coming upon them, saying, &ldquo;Then the Lord said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land. For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the Lord...they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah&rdquo; (vv. 14-15).</p><p>The coming evil was like a spoiler who would suddenly come upon them. The enemies would thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine (Jer. 6:9, 26), and the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness would cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem, for the land would be desolate (Jer. 7:34).</p><p>In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the first year of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah, &ldquo;From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the Lord hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you...but ye have not hearkened....Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words, behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the Lord, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof...and will utterly destroy them...and make them... perpetual desolations&rdquo; (Jer. 25:3, 8-9).</p><p>Finally, in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city. Zedekiah was captured, and his sons and the nobles of Judah were slain. The walls of the city were broken down, the houses in the city were burned, and the remnant was carried away to Babylon (Jer. 39:2-9).</p><h2 class="head2">C. Weeping for the Stiff-necked<br />and Unrepentant People</h2><p>Jerusalem fell and the people were taken captive. All the warnings of Jeremiah were fulfilled. But because he loved God and God&rsquo;s people, Jeremiah could not bear to see the fall of Israel and the loss of God&rsquo;s glory due to the degradation of the people of Israel. Thus Jeremiah wrote Lamentations and wept for them.</p><p>Lamentations, composed of five chapters which are five songs, may be divided into five sections: suffering, lamenting, hope, confessing, and prayer. Except for the fifth, each song speaks first of the tragic destruction of Jerusalem and then of the righteousness of God&rsquo;s severe judgment. &ldquo;How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! How is she become as a widow! She that was great among the nations&rdquo; (1:1). &ldquo;How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel&rdquo; (2:1). &ldquo;The Lord is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment&rdquo; (1:18). &ldquo;Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people&rdquo; (2:11). &ldquo;Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old&rdquo; (5:21).</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE PROPHETS IN THE LAND OF CAPTIVITY</h2><p>Daniel and Ezekiel were the prophets in the land of captivity.</p> <h2 class="head2">A. Daniel</h2><h2 class="head3">1. With His Three Friends Being Overcomers<br />in Captivity from Their Youth</h2><p>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and carried away Daniel and his three friends (Dan. 1:1-6). They were chosen to be taught in the palace and prepared to serve the king, for they were well favored, skillful in all wisdom, and gifted in knowledge and the understanding of science.</p><p>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king&rsquo;s meat, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. Daniel requested that they be tested ten days by being given only vegetables to eat and water to drink, after which their countenances would be judged. At the end of ten days, their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the rest. Hence, the prince of the eunuchs allowed them to take vegetables and water only (Dan. 1:8-16).</p><p>At that time, God&rsquo;s people were carried away, the house of God was destroyed, and the vessels of the house were taken to the house of the false gods (Dan. 1:2; 2 Chron. 36:7). The dominion and glory of God on the earth were completely gone. The people were under the rule of the king of Babylon and were associated with demons, because even the food they ate and the wine they drank, being sacrificed to demons, were defiled and unclean. In such a time, God gained Daniel and his three friends, some who cared for the dominion and glory of God. They were determined that, by refraining from eating the royal food and drinking the royal wine, they would not be defiled. Hence, they were the overcomers in captivity.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Praying for the Holy City<br />and the Holy Temple of God<br />until They Were Recovered</h2><p>In the first year of Darius, Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem (Dan. 9:1-2; Jer. 25:11). Daniel prayed and made confession unto the Lord with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes concerning his sins and those of his nation. He presented his supplication before the Lord concerning the holy mountain, Jerusalem (Dan. 9:1-20). Then God heard the prayers made by His people. According to His promise, in the first year of Cyrus, the king of Persia, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus to make a proclamation allowing the people of Israel to go to Jerusalem of Judah and to rebuild the holy temple of the God of Israel (Ezra 1:1-3). Finally, Daniel saw the fulfillment of his prayer concerning Jerusalem (Dan. 1:21).</p><h2 class="head3">3. Interpreting the Image in Chapter Two<br />and Seeing the Visions<br />in Chapters Seven through Twelve of His Book</h2><p>God gave Daniel extraordinary wisdom to interpret the image in Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream. This was a great image. Its head was of fine gold; its breast and its arms, of silver; its belly and its thighs, of bronze; its legs, of iron; and its feet, part iron and part clay. This was a prophecy concerning the nations of the earth. The head of gold symbolizes Babylon; the breast and arms of silver, Medo-Persia; the belly of bronze, Greece; the two legs of iron, the eastern and western Roman Empires; and the feet of iron mixed with clay, the nations, which in the period after the fall of Rome and before the second coming of Christ, would be part democracy and part autocracy. The prophecy concerning the nations represented by the image has been fulfilled in history. At the end of the dream, a stone, cut out without hands, smote the image upon its feet, which were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces. &ldquo;Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together...that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth&rdquo; (vv. 34-35). This is a prophecy concerning Christ. He is the stone, cut without human hands, which will come down from heaven to smite the image, the kingdoms of the earth, and break them into pieces. Then He will become a great mountain, the kingdom of God, which will fill the whole earth (Rev. 11:15).</p> <p>Chapter seven presents the first series of visions seen by Daniel, that is, the visions of the four beasts, the ten horns, the little horn, the Ancient of Days, and the Son of Man. Chapter eight presents the second series of visions seen by Daniel, that is, the visions of the ram, the he-goat, the great horn, the four notable horns, and the little horn. The second half of chapter nine presents Daniel&rsquo;s third vision, the vision of the seventy weeks. Chapters ten through twelve present the fourth series of visions seen by Daniel.</p><p>Of all these visions, the most important are those of the four beasts in chapter seven and of the seventy weeks in chapter nine. These two visions, plus the image in chapter two, are the crucial points of Bible prophecy from the time of Israel&rsquo;s return from captivity until eternity.</p><p>The four beasts in chapter seven correspond to the empires of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome in Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream. The fact that they are signified by beasts indicates that these empires were cruel, merciless, and inhuman.</p><p>The seventy weeks in chapter nine can be divided into three stages of seven weeks, sixty-two weeks, and one week (vv. 24-27). Seven weeks are forty-nine years, that is, from the proclamation of Artaxerxes, the king of Persia, to rebuild the city of Jerusalem until the completion of the rebuilding. Sixty-two weeks are 434 years, that is, the exact period of time from the completion of the rebuilding of the holy city to the cutting off, the crucifixion, of the anointed One (Christ). After that, the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary (v. 26). This refers to Titus, the prince of Rome who destroyed the city of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. Following this, there is an interim period, that is, the age of the mystery of the church. Then at the end of the church age, the final week of seven years will come. In the beginning of those seven years, Antichrist will confirm the covenant with many people. At the middle of the seven years Antichrist will break the covenant, persecute God&rsquo;s people, carry out destruction in the holy city and sanctuary, and do evil things. At the end of the seven years, Christ will defeat Antichrist at Armageddon (Rev. 16:16; 19:19-21). Thus, Christ will be the King on the earth, and the nations on earth will become the kingdom of Christ (Rev. 11:15).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Ezekiel Seeing the Visions<br />in the Land of Captivity concerning<br />the Spiritual Recovery of God&rsquo;s People</h2><p>Ezekiel was also a prophet in captivity. His visions were concerning the spiritual recovery of God&rsquo;s people.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Vision of the Wind, the Cloud, the Fire,<br />and the Electrum in Chapter One of His Book<br />Signifying the Spiritual Revival of God&rsquo;s People</h2><p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire.&rdquo;</p><p>This verse mentions four things: wind, cloud, fire, and amber or electrum. God uses physical things to illustrate spiritual things. The strong wind signifies the Holy Spirit. At Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out as a rushing violent wind (Acts 2:1-4). The whirlwind brought in a great cloud, which also signifies the Spirit. When the Spirit stirs up people, He is like the wind. When the Spirit visits people and overshadows people, He is like a great cloud. The great cloud was covered with a fire. God is a consuming fire (Heb. 12:29). Therefore, fire signifies God&rsquo;s burning and sanctifying power, which performs a shining and purifying work in man. Out of the fire comes the glowing electrum. Electrum signifies the divine nature in glory and honor.</p><p>Whenever there is a spiritual revival, there is the rushing wind of the Spirit followed by the covering of man by the Spirit. There is the burning of the consuming fire in man, shining and purifying. Thus man becomes like the electrum, shining with glory and honor.</p> <h2 class="head3">2. God Reviving His People and Giving Them<br />a New Heart and a New Spirit<br />in Chapter Thirty-six</h2><p>Verses 26 and 27 say, &ldquo;A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you...And I will put my Spirit within you.&rdquo; Before a person is saved, his heart is an old heart. But after a person is saved, his heart becomes a new heart. Furthermore, man&rsquo;s heart is renewed in every revival. The heart is man&rsquo;s loving organ. The old heart does not love God but rather things outside of God. When God comes in to visit and revive man, He not only cleanses his defilement, but also renews his heart and softens it to love God.</p><p>God also gives man a new spirit. The spirit of man was deadened because of the fall. The new spirit is a living spirit. God revives man&rsquo;s old and deadened spirit and makes it a new spirit. He gives the spirit of man a new function that man may be able to contact God and fellowship with Him.</p><p>Furthermore, God puts His own Spirit within man. When God puts His Spirit within man, God Himself enters into man, so that within man, there is God. At such a time, man is completely renewed within and becomes a renewed man.</p><h2 class="head3">3. God&rsquo;s People as the Dry Bones<br />Being Revived and Formed into God&rsquo;s Army<br />in Chapter Thirty-seven</h2><p>Verses 1, 5, 6, and 10 say, &ldquo;...in the midst of the valley which was full of bones;...thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin....So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.&rdquo;</p><p>After their degradation, the children of Israel were not only sinners but also dead people. They were surely dead to the uttermost. What was left was just a pile of white bones. God caused Ezekiel to prophesy twice. When he prophesied the first time, there was a noise and a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to bone. Then sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them from above. When Ezekiel prophesied the second time, breath came into them and they lived; then they stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. This was the prophecy that God would revive His people and make them one.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Rebuilding<br />of the Holy City and the Holy Temple<br />in Chapters Forty through Forty-eight</h2><p>Ezekiel 40:1-2 says, &ldquo;The hand of the Lord was upon me....In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.&rdquo;</p><p>Ezekiel 40 through 48 are concerned with the rebuilding of the holy city and the holy temple. He saw the holy city and the holy temple in this vision. Here, all the items and their measurements have their spiritual significance.</p><p>There are forty-eight chapters in Ezekiel. At the end God obtains a holy temple and a holy city in the Holy Land. The holy temple is for God&rsquo;s presence, fellowship, and service, whereas the holy city is for God&rsquo;s ruling, administration, and government. The building of the holy city and the holy temple are the issue of the enjoyment of God by His people in their living in the Holy Land. When God&rsquo;s people have an abundant and full enjoyment of God, He obtains from them an expression in fullness&mdash;God&rsquo;s house and God&rsquo;s city. Here God can fellowship with man and rule through man; man can enjoy God, and God can also enjoy man. Man can be filled to the uttermost with God and can express God.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>After the degradation of the priesthood, God raised up Samuel as a prophet to bring in the kingship. After the degradation of the kingship, God still used the prophets to care for the people He had judged and sent into captivity by speaking to them constantly, either by rebuking their evil deeds or by promising them that they would return to the Holy Land. Jeremiah, a prophet at the time of the carrying away, who was taken into captivity, rebuked the king and the people for their sins, warned them of the captivity and the loss of the kingdom, and lamented over the stiff-necked and unrepentant people. Daniel and his three friends were among the prophets in the land of captivity. They were God&rsquo;s overcomers in the captivity. Daniel prayed for God&rsquo;s holy city and His holy temple until the holy city and temple were recovered. There was also Ezekiel who saw visions in the land of captivity. He spoke of God&rsquo;s coming to His people in their recovery to revive them and give them a new heart and a new spirit, making them as dry bones revitalized to become His army and eventually to rebuild His holy city and holy temple in their midst.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>What were the sins for which the prophet Jeremiah rebuked the kings and the people?</li><li>What was the situation of God&rsquo;s people when they were in captivity?
