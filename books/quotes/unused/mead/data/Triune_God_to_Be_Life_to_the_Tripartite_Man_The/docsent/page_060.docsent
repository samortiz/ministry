   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING A GRAFTED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The life that we live together with Christ is a grafted life Rom 11:24; 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are joined with Christ and live together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we live by Christ, Christ's element is added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This element is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We live a life that is actually Christ living through us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has no intention of asking us to do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the past, our teaching concerning the cross stopped with termination.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason our teaching was incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Termination is not the end. Paul said, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me" Gal 2:20 . In Galatians, Paul said that he lived a life not by himself alone, but by Christ as his partner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He lived a life by Christ who was with him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ was living in him and through him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The turning point in Paul's experience was the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sixty years ago I read some books concerning the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was helped to know that I had died, that I was finished, and that I should not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result of this understanding, I determined not to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, I realized that my understanding concerning the cross was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To say that I have been crucified with Christ is certainly right, but I also must live.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I still live and do things, but I no longer do them by myself; I do them with Christ who lives within me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way I live a grafted life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our experience the turning point in living a life with Christ is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the cross, we live, but not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With the cross, we still live, but we no longer live by ourselves; Christ now lives with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I prepare to speak a message, I check with myself as to whether I am going to speak by myself or with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I realize that if I do not go through the cross, whatever I speak has nothing to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must always realize that we have been crucified, and that we should no longer live by ourselves but by Christ who lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Death terminates the old creation; resurrection germinates the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The cross is the turning point.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we reckon ourselves as being on the cross, we are terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We die in the old creation, and we now live in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In resurrection we no longer live alone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We now live in the new creation with Christ living with us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We and Christ live together a grafted life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE CROSS OF CHRIST BEING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE GOAL OF CHRIST'S INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>CHRIST'S MANGER POINTING TO HIS CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The cross of Christ was the goal of Christ's incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His manger pointed to His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was born to be crucified, but when we were reborn, we were already crucified Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His story is one of going to the cross to be crucified, and our story is one of being crucified already.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we live a crucified life 2 Cor 4:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This crucified life is the application of Christ's crucifixion, issuing in the manifestation of His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE CROSS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>BRINGING FORTH THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The cross of Christ is not the goal, but the means to reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The goal is to bring forth the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So where the cross is, the resurrection follows, and in the resurrection is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the way for us to experience and participate in the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The way is to take the cross, and the issue is the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>OUR SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A CYCLE OF THE CROSS AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>NO DEATH, NO SPIRIT; MORE SPIRIT, MORE DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our spiritual experience is a cycle of the cross and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not experience death, we do not experience the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the more we experience death, the more Spirit we enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then the more Spirit we enjoy, the more death we experience.</S>
