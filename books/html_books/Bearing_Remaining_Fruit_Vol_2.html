<h1 class="title">THE CONTENT OF CHRISTIAN MEETINGS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE EFFECT OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
THROUGH DOOR-KNOCKING BEING UNLIMITED</h2>
<p>From our observation of the new ones&rsquo; coming to the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, we found that the sweetest part is the fellowship with some light refreshments after the meeting. This time of fellowship has many advantages. First, the brothers and sisters can have more contact with the new believers. Through more fellowship and contact, the new believers&rsquo; real situation can be known. This is very helpful to new believers. It can cause them to become stable in Christ and in the church. Moreover, during the fellowship with refreshments the new believers can be invited to visit the meeting hall, through which they can be introduced to the church service, causing them to further know the church life.</p>
<p>Not only did a great number of new ones attend the meeting, but the way they entered the meeting hall was also orderly. There were about two thousand people who came. The attendance of two thousand people proves that there are five or six thousand people in the background, and most of these five or six thousand have meetings in their homes. This is indeed encouraging.</p>
<p>From the new believers&rsquo; testimonies we see that the result of preaching the gospel through door-knocking is unlimited. One brother testified that after he was saved, his cousin and his colleagues were all saved. How wonderful this is! When the gospel goes out, it can be widespread. We believe this has no limits. Another brother testified that while he was knocking on a door, the friend there was about to commit suicide. If the brother had not gone that day, that friend might have already committed suicide. This truly encourages us, as we feel that this way is not only workable but also excellent. There may not be another way by which the gospel can be widespread in such an unlimited way.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some testified that they were considering to become Christians but did not know how, and they were hoping that someone would visit them. The brothers and sisters were there at the right moment. This situation can be compared to the Lord sending Peter to visit Cornelius&rsquo;s house in Acts 10. On the one hand, the Lord wanted Peter to go, while on the other hand, the Lord had already done all the preparation work in Cornelius&rsquo;s house. Therefore, when we little &ldquo;Peters&rdquo; go to knock on doors, there are already quite a few people waiting for us. This situation also proves that if we had knocked on doors selectively and not from house to house, it would not have been possible for us to have such results. If we still followed the old ways to publicize in the newspapers, put out advertisements, and invite people by phone, we would not have had this kind of result. At the same time, the gospel could not have been so widespread and so properly preached. Preaching the gospel through door-knocking is truly positive and profitable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SONS OF PEACE IN THE GOSPEL OF LUKE</h2>
<p>In His Word the Lord has shown us knocking on doors from house to house. Matthew 9:36 says of the Lord Jesus, that &ldquo;seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd.&rdquo; The Lord told His disciples that they needed to pray: &ldquo;The harvest is great, but the workers few; therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). In this short passage, on the one hand, the Lord likened God&rsquo;s chosen people to sheep, while on the other hand, He likened them to His harvest. The sheep have to be found, while the harvest has to be reaped and brought home.</p>
<p>In both the Gospels of Luke and of Matthew the Lord said that He sent forth His disciples as lambs in the midst of wolves (Luke 10:3; Matt. 10:16). What the Lord said here seems to be contradictory. He first said that these people were His sheep, harassed, cast away, and not having a shepherd. On the other hand, He said that He sent the disciples out into the midst of wolves. However, the Lord Himself explained, seeming to say, &ldquo;I send you out. Simply go from house to house and do not be selective.&rdquo; Then He said, &ldquo;And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it&rdquo; (Luke 10:6). Such a son of peace is one who was chosen and predestinated by God before the foundation of the world. Hence, this shows us that although there is a pack of wolves, the sheep of God are among them. It may look as if all of them are wolves. However, the sheep are quietly and securely hidden in the midst of the wolves. These sheep are the sons of peace. If we rely only on putting out newspaper advertisements and making telephone calls, we may never be able to find them. Instead, all that we find may be wolves. However, if we go out knocking on doors from house to house, there will be many sheep, the sons of peace, waiting for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOCKING ON DOORS FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE<br />
ALL OVER THE EARTH<br />
IN PREPARATION FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RETURN</h2>
<p>We thank the Lord for revealing this way to us. I hope that the brothers and sisters in the church will be able to knock on the doors of the whole world from house to house. This all depends on whether or not we would do it. On the one hand, we are reluctant to stir people up to serve full-time, but on the other hand, we hope that there will be a group of college students who can serve the Lord full-time after graduation. Figuratively speaking, they are a &ldquo;suicide squad&rdquo; with a spirit of the gospel, using <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> as a weapon, spreading the gospel from Taiwan, through Thailand, Burma, India, the Arab world, then to Greece, all the way to Asia Minor, the Aegean Sea, then to Eastern Europe, and to Egypt, South Africa, and so forth. By that time, there will be gospel stations and local churches all over the world. The gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth, and then the end will come (Matt. 24:14).</p>
<p>Having the gospel preached to the whole earth indeed makes us excited, but it also means that we must experience much hardship and suffering, such as not being able to eat and to sleep well. However, there will be sweetness in bitterness, and bitterness in sweetness, and at the end of the bitterness, the sweetest part will come&mdash;the coming of our Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s coming requires our hastening. If we do not hasten His coming, He will not come back. In order to hasten His coming, we have to prepare the environment on the earth. It is not until the environment is well prepared that He will come back.</p>
<p>For the past two thousand years, Christianity has indeed tried to do something on the earth according to the Bible. However, the overall situation of Christianity on the earth today is not very encouraging. Hence, the Lord has raised up His recovery on the earth, which is not motivated by men. For the past twenty-five years, besides the churches in the Far East, the Lord has raised up more than five hundred fifty local churches in the other big continents. Who did this? We have not employed any preachers, and we have no missions nor any fund-raising, but the Lord has led us to spread from continent to continent in this way. This has all been done by the Lord. When we recall how a meeting sometimes requires interpretation for ten or fifteen languages, it is difficult to imagine how much the Lord has done through His recovery.</p>
<p>Door-knocking truly can bring in all kinds of people, and the result is immeasurable. Therefore, wherever we are, we have to practice door-knocking. After going door-knocking for a month, we can gain at least two or three brothers and sisters. We may then form a group with them and go out to knock on doors again. After knocking for a month, eight or ten will definitely be gained. Knocking again for a month, thirty may be gained; then knocking for another month, sixty can be gained. If it goes on like this, the result will be tremendous. If the saints in the recovery in various places hear this, aim at this, and practice this, then the propagation and increase of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be unlimited.</p>
<p>Some may ask, What if there are false believers mixed in the midst? In principle, it was not that first the tares were sown and then the wheat. Rather, the Bible says that the wheat was sown first, and then the tares came (Matt. 13:37-40). Therefore, there are always the real ones first and then the false ones. In that sense, the existence of the false ones proves that the real ones already existed. Ten false ones may indicate the presence of one hundred real ones. The Lord Jesus told us in Matthew 13 that the seeds were sown here and there, but in the end, tares (a kind of weed similar to foxtail) grew in the midst of the wheat. Where did these tares come from? Probably the only answer is that they were spread by the blowing of the wind. It is amazing that the wind sent the tares only to the wheat field but not to the cotton field. I believe it is not easy to find the reason for this, and any explanation may not be accurate. It is very meaningful that the Lord Jesus used this as a parable. What He meant was that we should not be afraid of speaking or of knocking on doors. Rather, we should knock on as many doors as possible. We should baptize anyone who wants to be baptized. We have to believe that among those who are baptized, the number of the false ones will be far less than the real ones. If one hundred people are baptized, perhaps only one of them will be false. Therefore, do not worry. Simply take courage until one day all the doors on the earth will be visited by knocking.</p><h2 class="head1">SOME FELLOWSHIP<br />
CONCERNING CHRISTIAN MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Factors of Christian Meetings&mdash;<br />
the Spirit, the Word, Prayer, and Reading</h2>
<p>The new ones often come to the meetings joyfully, but it seems that we all forget our sense of duty. As a result, the new ones are not satisfied, and they leave the meeting disappointed. In simple words, those who attend the meetings regularly are not well prepared, so the meetings do not have the adequate supply and riches. By riches we do not mean merely shouting or singing boldly. Rather, we are referring to a meeting that has weighty prayers, prayers with light, life, truth, experience, and supply. Mere stirring up and singing with shouting in the meetings are not the proper worship to God or remembrance of the Lord. Rather, they may be meaningless actions. This shows that we have not received adequate training concerning the content of the meetings.</p>
<p>A meeting must have content, but the content does not depend on a fixed and rigid program. In a big meeting, such as a meeting with over ten thousand people, the number of people constrains us to have a kind of program and let several brothers lead the meeting. In reality, however, a meeting does not have a set program. Nevertheless, it still has its course and its factors. The factors of a meeting are nothing more than the spirit, the Word, prayer, and reading. The spirit is God&rsquo;s Spirit with our spirit. The Word is the Word of God, that is, the Bible. Prayer includes praise, and reading the Word of God includes prayer; these four items are the elements of the contents of a meeting. Just as a delicious meal has its main ingredients&mdash;rice, noodles, chicken, duck, fish, and meat, together with vegetables and fruit&mdash;our meetings must have the spirit, the Word, prayer with praises, and the reading and speaking of the word of God. These are all necessary in a meeting.</p>
<p>There is too much singing in some of our Lord&rsquo;s table meetings. To speak even more strongly, I would say that sometimes the saints sing hymns to the extent that they are merely playing or being entertained, without any control. This is not right. This will cause the newcomers to be bewildered about such a strange place, wondering whether they are in a sports arena or a hall for worship. It is a hall for worship, yet there may be no worship rendered. Although sacred songs are sung, there is no flavor of sacred singing. What then should we do? We should pray immediately, using a proper prayer to bring everyone before God. The above matters show us that if we all in various places only go knocking on doors, leading people to be baptized and establishing home meetings, yet we do not have the proper spiritual content in the meetings, there will be a great deficiency.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sharing the Responsibility in the Meetings<br />
by Exercising to Pray</h2>
<p>In addition to the elders, every person should share the important responsibilities in the meetings by exercising to pray, so as to fill the content of the meetings with the spirit, the Word, prayers, and the reading and speaking of the word of God. In the matter of prayer, there is no difference between brothers and sisters. When we come before God, there is no distinction. Perhaps a sister&rsquo;s prayer may not immediately &ldquo;steer the helm&rdquo; of the meeting in the right direction. The reason the helm does not turn may simply be that there is only one person turning it. At this point another sister should immediately add a prayer. Then if there is still no turning, a brother should add another prayer, and if necessary, another brother should add more. In this way, everyone is in one accord, and the helm turns. If one, two, or three prayers are not sufficient, a fourth and fifth can be added until the direction turns. This will turn away the playful atmosphere and turn everyone into the spirit of prayer. Moreover, our prayers must have the content of life, light, truth, experience, and supply.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Content of the Meetings<br />
Needing to Be Enriched<br />
in Order to Render the Best Life Supply</h2>
<p>If we spend much effort to bring the new ones to the meeting, but we bring them only to watch an exciting display, this is a complete failure in terms of the proper content. To be sure, the ones we bring are all newly saved and may not have much spiritual feeling. It may seem good to them to visit the meeting hall where so many people are excited and joyful, a situation which can rarely be seen elsewhere. Where else in the world can anyone find such a pleasant gathering? However, those who truly know the Lord realize what we are really doing. We have not given anything to people except some laughter and excitement. Where is our content? In that meeting, other than the singing of some hymns, what content have we actually given to people? It may be nothing. We have only shown them some excitement.</p>
<p>Because this kind of excitement may seem very good, many are willing to come again. It is difficult to find a situation like the church, with several hundred people coming together, talking and enjoying with no fighting or quarreling; this is indeed rare. However, after coming for two more times, some new ones will not come again. This is because there is no content. People want something with content. We should give them a content that is nothing other than truth, light, life, and testimonies. Therefore, when we lead the home meetings from house to house, we need to practice not only teaching them <em>Life Lessons</em> topic by topic, lesson by lesson, but also having more fellowship with them. Through this fellowship, life is sown into them, and with every visit we give them more life supply. This way is limitless; it is altogether comprehensive and manifold.</p>
<p>In the practice of the home meetings, we should have a three-minute speaking before the meeting and a five-minute speaking after the meeting. These three and five minutes are very important. We need to prepare beforehand what we will supply them with so that between the two lines of speaking the riches of the Lord can be sown into them, and the life of the Lord can be supplied to them. This is the lesson that every one of us needs to learn. Moreover, we have to know how to use <em>Life Lessons</em>. When we take this new way, we study while we conduct trainings, putting things into practice, observing the practical needs, and then seeking for improvement. Our biggest shortcoming at present is that the content of our meetings is not rich. Hence, we must do our best to fill up this shortcoming as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Meetings Not Being Playful and without Control</h2>
<p>To be playful in the meetings is a big mistake. Such playfulness in our meetings should not have occurred in the past and was improper. For example, in singing the hymn &ldquo;Since Jesus Came into My Heart,&rdquo; certain ones sang the line &ldquo;Floods of joy o&rsquo;er my soul like the sea billows roll...&rdquo; prolonging <em>roll</em> in a peculiar and excessive way. This is neither praise nor worship but is altogether playful and not proper. Our spirit should be released, and our voice must be uplifted, but we should not shout aloud for the purpose of having fun. We are not watching a ball game in the meeting; we are gathered around the Lord to worship, praise, and remember Him. We should be rejoicing before the Lord, as David leapt joyfully before the Lord (2 Sam. 6:14-16), but we should never be playful. We have to pay more attention to this matter and should never take it lightly.</p>
 <p>Our eyes should be open, and our feeling should be sensitive. It is often easy to lose control when people are gathered together. We should rejoice and even sing joyfully. However, there should not be any flavor of playfulness in this joyful singing, and we should not take it lightly. Whatever makes people laugh and brings in a taste of playfulness should be totally avoided. We are gathered together for the purpose of worshipping God and remembering the Lord. On one hand, we minister the truth and supply life so that people can see a fresh and living situation when they come to the meeting. On the other hand, we should make people feel respectful, sensing that God is here, because we are before God and before the Lord.</p>
<p>Never despise the newly saved ones, because every man created by God has within him a desire, a feeling, to worship God. We can compare this to a thirsty person who wants to be quenched inwardly by drinking a glass of cold water; if we give him a glass of hot water, he cannot drink it. When people come to the meetings, they are not attending a school party or going to a nightclub or a ball game. People come to meetings to seek God. This is man&rsquo;s basic concept. Hence, we meet not to have fun but to worship God, to remember the Lord, and to supply people with life.</p><h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL,<br />
STRESSING THE MATTER OF SIN</h2>
<p>We need to pay attention to leading the new ones to confess their sins before the Lord. In the meetings we have heard many testimonies about how people were saved, but we have not often heard someone testify that he felt he was sinful, that he had confessed his sins before the Lord, and that he believed that the precious blood of the Lord Jesus shed on the cross for him had cleansed away all his sins. Often no one testifies about this point. This is a big deficiency in our preaching of the gospel. Therefore, when we contact new believers, whether before or after their baptism, we should have some good fellowship with them on the matter of sin so that they may have a proper feeling toward sin.</p>
<p>People must realize that in the Bible the first word of the gospel is &ldquo;repent&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). On the day of Pentecost, after the crowd heard the gospel preached by Peter, they asked Peter, &ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; Peter said to them, &ldquo;Repent&rdquo; (Acts 2:37-38). Of course, the way we have discovered to use <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> to preach the gospel is right, but using <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> is simply to open the door. We may also compare this to opening the cork of a bottle; after opening the bottle, we need much careful study as to what the bottle should contain. First, we should put repentance into man that he may know that he is sinful. This is what we lacked in the past, so now we all have to fill this gap. We need to learn how to lead people to repent, how to help them to care for their conscience, and how to cause them to have an inner sense. For example, if someone was dishonest and offended his parents, brothers, and sisters, we certainly cannot rebuke him face to face. Rather, we should first pray before the Lord. Then when we go to preach the gospel to him, we have to learn how to lead him to repent and be convicted. When the Spirit comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment (John 16:8). The word <em>convict</em> in Greek is a word that is difficult to translate. This word denotes thorough repentance, confession, and condemning of oneself. This is what is lacking in our gospel, and we have to endeavor to make it up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S TABLE MEETINGS<br />
NEEDING TO HAVE A SPECIFIC SUPPLY OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>For the sake of the new ones in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings, we should fellowship concerning the meaning of bread-breaking and have a certain amount of ministry from the Word. We should have a message every Lord&rsquo;s Day to share with the saints. Strictly speaking, the church should be living and full of riches to the extent that there is no need to give the saints a printed message excerpt. Rather, there should be a brother who simply rises to speak a passage for ten minutes. The speaking should be living, enlightening, real, and rich. Although since Brother Nee&rsquo;s time, we have tried hard to do well in this matter, this has not been worked out until now. The old way in the past annulled this matter. Now we are like the lame, walking with a crutch. We hope that after six months or a year, some skilled persons may be brought forth. They should have some learning and can use ten to fifteen minutes in the meeting to lead all the saints to read a few passages in the Bible, to pray-read together, and to speak something so that people can be benefited and nourished.</p>
<p>If in a meeting of two thousand people, hardly one word of life can be heard throughout the meeting, this is not right. We cannot merely give people hymns, because when people sing hymns, they seldom pay attention to the meaning of the hymn; often they pay attention only to the melody, sound, and expression. Hence, in every meeting there should be the spirit and the word instead of entertainment, making merry, or being playful, all of which should be totally avoided. Meetings should be living and released, but there absolutely should not be any playfulness or merrymaking. This does not mean that we should put on a long face in the meetings. Rather, it means that we have to give people a sense of solemnity. After all, the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting is for the remembrance of the Lord and the worship of God. Although today is the age of grace, as long as people contact and meet the Lord, they will prostrate before Him. The presence of the Lord often causes people to be in awe and is not as light as we may have understood. This speaking is not to discourage us but to help us to practice diligently so that every activity in the meeting can be carried out properly before the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STRENGTHENING THE TRAINING AND PRACTICE<br />
OF HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Although the way we are taking is the right one, it is very difficult to succeed completely in this last step of practicing the home meetings. This is a very heavy burden within us. In the past we baptized people, but we could not keep them because we did not have the home meetings, and we did not know how to practice the home meetings. Now we have spent much time and effort to practice this, hoping that through the home meetings in our localities we will be able to establish people in the church life and cause them to grow in life.</p>
<p>An enthusiastic display is momentary, and excitement is temporary. We have to nourish people continuously, as a mother prepares meals at home several times a day, always feeding her children from the time they are born until they are at least twenty. This is not an easy matter. When we practice home meetings, we have to see them with this view. It is necessary that first we are enriched with life, equipped with the truth, and skilled in our method. These three things&mdash;the enrichment of life, the equipping of truth, and the usage and practice of the lessons for the home meetings&mdash;must be well taken care of. We have to experiment with the home meetings personally, attending them to see how they are conducted and carried out. The same Bible and <em>Life Lessons</em>in others&rsquo; hands may be rich, living, fresh, and enlightening, but when they are in our hands, they may not work effectively. This should not be the case. We all help people to read the Bible, but while others do it in a living and enlightening way, we may do it in a dead, rigid, and darkening way. This shows us that we all need to be trained.</p>
<p>If the home meetings are practiced successfully, the new way will be successful, but if the home meetings are not practiced successfully, our labor for the new way will be in vain. This matter is very serious. Hence, we need to pray to ask the Lord to give us a clear view for the way ahead. Apparently there are many things that are praiseworthy and encouraging, but the content of the meetings does not deserve any praises, nor is it encouraging. We should not say that it is at least better than that in Christianity. We should not compare our picture with the black picture. Our standard for comparison is not yellow earth but gold. How much gold is in us? We need to be continuously enriched with life, truth, light, and experience, and exercise continuously with our methods until we are skillful.</p>
<p>(A message given on April 28, 1987 in Taipei, Taiwan)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WEIGHT OF LIFE REQUIRED<br />
IN LEADING HOME MEETINGS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FLOCKING NATURE CREATED BY GOD FOR MAN</h2>
<p>The home meetings are according to the longing of man. Nevertheless, they are against man&rsquo;s habits, customs, and traditions. On the one hand, there is a desire within man, but on the other hand, many are not willing to pay the price to practically achieve this desire. Man is created by God and desires to flock together. This nature is an innate need within him. If a person is sent to live on a mountain, even though he had his whole family there, he would still feel lonely and lacking. This is because having only himself and his family cannot meet the need of the flocking nature which God created in him. Man&rsquo;s nature is to flock together.</p>
<p>As a result of their research, sociologists claim that man needs to be gregarious. Seventy years ago there was a certain Christian youth association which laid emphasis on three aspects of education: moral, intellectual, and physical. Morality refers to ethics, intellect implies wisdom, and physical education is for the body. According to the Bible, the body is the outermost part of man, the soul is where our reasoning and intellect reside, and the spirit is the noblest part in which there is morality. Gradually, in less than ten years, that youth association altered its motto, saying that there are four aspects of education: moral, intellectual, physical, and social education. Instead of the three aspects of education, they said there should be four. They realized that in human society there is such a need called &ldquo;flocking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lesson fourteen of the second volume of <em>Life Lessons</em> is on the meetings. It speaks particularly of the human nature and its characteristic of flocking together. Man has a gregarious nature. He is not like the wolves but like the sheep, who flock together. It is rare to see a sheep living by itself. A wolf is different, however, often keeping to itself. To use another example, man is not like a butterfly but like the bees, which also have a gathering instinct. When a Christian is saved, the new life within him enriches the human life that originally was created according to God&rsquo;s image. Man&rsquo;s intellect, moral characteristic, and good nature were all created by God according to what He is. Thus, man is the outward form, and God is the inward content. An unsaved person not only has God&rsquo;s image, but he also has the need for being moral and intellectual, exercising physically, and gathering together with others. However, his human life cannot fully meet all those needs. For this reason, people turn in wrong directions to seek satisfaction.</p>
<p>Today in our society there are many social activities. Nearly every kind of entertainment requires more than one person to participate. One man alone cannot entertain himself. Dancing, for example, requires a group of people to take part. One cannot dance by himself for very long. Other group activities include ball games, various sports, concerts, and clubs. Therefore, we must realize that the instinct to gather together can also bring in many evils.</p>
<p>After we are saved, we are delivered not only from sin but even more from the improper condition of our human nature. There are love and affection in human nature, but if they are exercised in an inappropriate, improper way, they become sinful. When they are properly exercised, they are not sinful. Likewise, there is nothing wrong with eating and drinking. Indeed, how can one survive without eating and drinking? However, when man abuses eating and drinking, he makes eating and drinking sinful. This is what people refer to as &ldquo;Wining, dining, carousing, and gambling.&rdquo; Eating and drinking are essential to human life, and there is nothing wrong with them. However, the secret lies in where we place our needs. If they are put in the right place, they are appropriate; if they are put in the wrong place, they are sin. As human beings, we have the need for love and gathering together, but love and gathering together must be put in the right place. Otherwise, both love and gathering together can produce the element of sin. Considering the crimes in society as a whole, we can see that most of them come out of these two needs&mdash;love and gathering together. All parents realize that they must not let their children have contact with bad children. If they are allowed to gather together with them, many problems will arise.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRISTIANITY INVENTING BIG MEETINGS<br />
TO MEET THE NEED<br />
OF THE FLOCKING NATURE OF MAN</h2>
<p>It is true that there is a flocking nature within man. When a man is saved, God&rsquo;s life comes into him. This divine life is even more of a flocking life, which in turn strengthens the need within man for gathering together. Thus, he desires to meet. However, he has to pay the price and learn in order to have a proper meeting. People desire to have gatherings, but many are unwilling to pay the price. For the sake of meeting the need of man&rsquo;s fallen, slothful, and loose character, fallen Christianity has invented big meetings. In addition, they have trained many pastors and preachers for the purpose of delivering messages to the gathered congregation. This is similar to the ancient Chinese people who came together to listen to legends of the past.</p>
<p>These pastors and preachers are good at entertaining people. Particularly in America, nearly all of the popular preachers are good at making people laugh. The entertaining speaking, the musical accompaniment, and the singing of hymns are a big attraction in Christianity. In the past in mainland China a church building was a Western style house with a tower on its top. It was quiet and clean, and its seats were very comfortable. When people went there to take a seat, no one would make a noise and no one would argue. Whoever went in would sit there in an orderly way. Playing the piano and singing were always included in the program. Afterward, one pastor after another would say prayers, read the Scriptures, speak sermons, and give blessings. This was very attractive. For this reason, many people liked to go to the chapel on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning and to the football field in the afternoon. This met both the psychological need and the physical need. That was the kind of meeting in Christianity that suited man&rsquo;s slothful and loose character as well as his need for gathering together.</p>
<p>This kind of situation has also entered unconsciously into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Especially in America, almost all who have turned to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, even though they have left the denominations and the improper ground, have not been delivered from the loose and lazy habit of attending big meetings. Many who have come to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery still have the desire to have a Sunday service, although they do not say it as such. They have had a change in form but not in content.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s society people have a holiday on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. During the weekdays, people of all trades and professions are busy and exhausted. On their day off, the Lord&rsquo;s Day, most of them prefer to take more rest. That is why many Sunday services in America start at 11 A.M. People go to the chapels in a leisurely and relaxed manner. It is very comfortable to sit there. There are singing, speaking, and telling of jokes, which raise people&rsquo;s enjoyment &ldquo;up to the heavens.&rdquo; It seems that all the problems related to their business, their family, and their children have been cast far, far away and forgotten completely. At the end, the pastor says some prayers and gives blessings. Then a bag or plate for the offering of money is passed around, and everyone leaves the church cheerfully. This is the situation of today&rsquo;s Christianity. For this reason there is a need of recovery. If we want to be well pleasing to the Lord and to seek what He wants, we must pay the price to live the church life that is ordained by the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
NOT BEING AN EASY MATTER</h2>
<p>It is not an easy matter to recover the meetings that are ordained by the Lord&mdash;the home meetings. In order to have home meetings, everyone has to be busy and diligent, and everyone needs to labor. In the home meetings there is no vocal quartet or a pastor giving a message or saying a prayer. Everything has to be done by ourselves. We may use eating as an example. Everyone needs to eat, but not every one likes to cook. Sisters cannot avoid cooking because of those around them, such as their husbands and children. Even so, a sister may still make a deal with her husband that she cooks for only six days and has one day off; otherwise, she will quit. Not only is cooking a hard and thankless chore, but washing afterward is also a burden. That is why all sorts of restaurants, Western or Chinese style, can be seen everywhere. People can eat whatever they like, and the restaurants have a booming business. This proves that man not only likes to eat but is also very lazy; he likes eating but not cooking.</p>
<p>This illustrates that not only the unsaved people need to gather together, but the saved ones have even more of a need. However, everyone likes to come to the meetings with the thought that others will prepare everything, and they simply can come to enjoy. The saved ones desire to have meetings, but few of them want to bear responsibility for the meetings. That is why we need to be trained to labor on the home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FUTURE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
BEING WITHOUT LIMIT<br />
IF THE HOME MEETINGS ARE A SUCCESS</h2>
<p>We need to see that it is not a small thing to practice the home meetings. If the home meetings are not properly handled, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be over, and there will certainly be no way for us to go on. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, whether or not the new ones can remain hinges on how well we handle the home meetings. If the home meetings are successful, people will remain, but if the home meetings are not successful, everything will be a failure. When we first came to Taiwan, we cared very much for small group meetings and not as much for the big meetings. As a result we had a great increase. However, after working for more than thirty years, the small group meetings are nearly gone, while the big meetings are all the more flourishing. The saints gradually like the big meetings and prefer to have the gifted brothers give messages. Then the church trains people to stand on the podium and give messages, specifically cultivating this kind of gift. Once we have this situation, the &ldquo;car&rdquo; is turned around, and we return to degradation. For this reason we need to change the system so that we may be delivered from this abnormal situation. However, this is by no means an easy task. It is like asking a family not to cook; no family can do this because everyone needs to eat. Today whether the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can spread, flourish, or even survive depends on whether we succeed in the home meetings. If we fail in the home meetings, we will go back to relying on the big meetings, which is degradation.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we do not need big meetings at all. The New Testament mentions big meetings when the whole church comes together (1 Cor. 14:23). Paul also implies this in Acts 20:20. However, as far as human living and eating are concerned, it is true locally and abroad that home-cooked meals are the most nutritious and capable of making us live longer. If a man eats in restaurants every day, he will be sickly.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee raised a cry again and again that we should have a meeting that is the same as the one described in 1 Corinthians 14:26. It should not be one person speaking while all the others listen, but &ldquo;each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation.&rdquo; You have this, and I have that; &ldquo;let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; Brother Nee tried to carry this out, and indeed he did it. From his writings we see that he abhorred big meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to the uttermost. He said that big meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Days should be abolished. In place of them, everyone should go to preach the gospel. However, even when the big meetings were dismissed, there were not many who went to preach the gospel. Therefore, he studied the Bible again and again with the hope of finding a proper way of meeting.</p>
<p>We have seen clearly that if the small meetings are flourishing, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will also become flourishing. Once big meetings are flourishing, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will decline. Therefore, the home meeting is a crucial matter, which is also a burden on our shoulders. May the young generation among us see this point clearly. Whether or not the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has a way depends on whether the home meetings are successful.</p>
<p>Since 1984 I have put aside the work in America except for the two semi-annual trainings. It seems that I have stopped almost all the work there just to come back to Taiwan to change the system, to experiment, and to see if the new way can work. Although we do not have the full assurance of success, we are persuaded that this is the right way. Whether or not it will be a success depends on our willingness to labor. If we are willing to labor, it will succeed; if we are not willing to labor, there will be no hope of success. Church history in the past two thousand years is a record of many repeated failures. The Brethren failed, the Baptist Church failed, and so did the Pentecostal movement. The main reason for their failures was that most of them preferred to have big meetings and to have well-known people give messages. They did not care to have a good meeting at home, where everyone has to exercise his spirit, grow in life, know the truth, and be dealt with, restricted, led, and strengthened by the Lord in his living. People do not like to pay such a price. They prefer an easy way.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is not easy for the host of a family to have a home meeting. Before a person believed in the Lord, he was free to do anything at home, seven days a week. Now he has believed in the Lord, been baptized, and agreed to have a home meeting once a week. When it is time for a home meeting, he has to dress himself neatly, tidy up his house, and wait for the saints to come for the meeting. On the one hand, he gains something, while on the other hand, this home meeting is a true bondage to him. Moreover, each one in the home meeting has to open his mouth to pray, to read the Bible, and to speak. If something goes wrong, he cannot help being bothered. That is the reason why we say it is not easy and is even difficult to have home meetings. However, we have to learn how to deal with these matters.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH DIFFICULT SITUATIONS<br />
IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Allowing the Lord to Increase,<br />
Gaining the Weight of Life</h2>
<p>In order to deal with difficult situations in the home meeting, we first need to be respectable persons, persons highly regarded by others. Even though the host of a home meeting may be a successful, famous, retired person over sixty years old, when we go to his home to lead the home meeting, we need to have his high appraisal as we stand or sit before him. We must be persons with weight and dignity. Even before we speak, by our expression, appearance, and posture, people may realize that we are persons with weight. This cannot be purchased with money or gained in a day. This takes a long time to cultivate.</p>
<p>We should be respectable before men. Where does this weight come from? Our weight comes first from life and second from the truth. If we grow in life and pursue the truth every day, year after year, little by little the element of life within us will increase spontaneously, and so also will the element of the truth. Thus, we become persons with weight and gravity. According to the Bible, life is the Lord Himself, and the truth is also the Lord Himself. Therefore, our weight is the Lord Himself. He is adding Himself into us more and more continuously. The addition of life and the truth is the addition of the Lord Himself. When people look at us, whether in our speaking or conduct, they will not find us light because there is weight within us.</p>
<p>Such a weight comes from the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s changing in us and His gradual growth in us since our salvation. If you young ones go home weekly or monthly, your parents will be very happy to see that you have such a change and growth. They will not think that you are pretending, because you live out such a life spontaneously. This is like our saying, &ldquo;Sincerity within is expressed without.&rdquo; Since we have been saved, day after day we have been growing in life. Thus a weight increases within us that the people around us can perceive.</p>
<p>Home meetings require skills, such as how to study <em>Life Lessons,</em> how to read the Scriptures, how to sing hymns, and how to speak. All these are skills and are necessary. However, these are still not primary. The most important thing is whether or not we have a spontaneous outflow of weight and gravity before others. Once others see us, they will find us to be weighty persons. This is not by pretense but is spontaneous. Your manner of speech is spontaneous, and out of this spontaneity there is something weighty. Such a weight is not from without but from within, which is the Lord Himself who has been added into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising to Pray<br />
and Be Filled with the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>For this purpose, we need to pray and be filled with the Holy Spirit. This Holy Spirit is the Lord. To be filled with the Holy Spirit is to be filled with the weight of the Lord. We all know that it takes time for life to grow. Growth cannot be attained instantly. It does not take much time to produce artificial flowers. A thousand pots of artificial flowers can be produced overnight. Yet after you have sown the seeds of real flowers, they still need two to three months of watering and fertilizing before they can grow. Therefore, all the activities in our church life must be the addition of weight within us. This weight and gravity are very useful in the home meetings.</p>
<p>Even a robber shows respect to a weighty person. Once there was an elderly sister, a Norwegian missionary, who took a boat from Shanghai to Tientsin in the north. On the way the boat came across pirates who were armed with swords and spears to rob the boat. When the owner of the boat and the captain were captured, the pirates took control and gave the orders. However, it was very strange that when those pirates saw the elderly sister, they all showed respect to her because she was filled with the weight of life in the Lord. Eventually, this Norwegian missionary became the &ldquo;commander-in-chief,&rdquo; and all the pirates listened to her. This was because she was a weighty person. Even just standing there, she was full of weight, which made the pirates respect her and listen to her.</p>
<p>This is the most important thing we must have when we go to practice the home meetings. Being young is not a hindrance; some people are light even though they are older. Whether we are young or old, once we go to practice the home meetings, the first thing we need to remember is that we must be weighty and that this weight needs to increase daily. We must pursue and learn in life and accept all kinds of dealing, restriction, and discipline. By learning in life, being freed from the habits in our behavior, breaking away from the influence of others, exercising to pray more and more, and allowing the Lord to fill us, we will become weighty over time.</p><h2 class="head2">Pursuing the Truth to Renew and<br />
Sanctify Our Whole Being</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we need to let the truth, the words given to us by the Lord in the Bible, sanctify us (John 17:17). The Lord&rsquo;s own word tells us that the truth can sanctify us. To translate <em>sanctify</em> as <em>make holy,</em> as in the Chinese Union Version, is too poor. <em>Separated</em> is a better translation, but the best translation is <em>sanctified.</em> The Lord&rsquo;s word not only renews us but also sanctifies us.</p>
<p>In which part does His word sanctify us? First of all, it sanctifies our concepts and our viewpoints. The reason why a person has opinions is that he has his viewpoints and perspectives, and because of his points of view, he has opinions. The first things that the Lord&rsquo;s words deal with are our viewpoints and perspectives. A person&rsquo;s views come from many sources. First, some views are innate. Second, they come from family education. Third, they come from formal education, and then they are cultivated from our social environment and background. Moreover, our habits, the influence of our friends, our experiences of life, and other matters all make up our particular viewpoints.</p>
<p>Not only does a young person in his twenties have his viewpoints, but even children who are only seven or eight years old have their viewpoints. Sometimes children even surprise and anger adults by trying to adjust them. This shows us how many concepts a person has. What can change a person&rsquo;s concepts? There is no other way but the truth. Once the truth enters into a person, it operates within him and transforms him. When the truth operates in someone and transforms him, it becomes life. Ultimately, truth and life are one as the Lord Himself. When we pursue life, grow in life, experience restrictions, and are regulated by the law of the Lord within us, and at the same time we study the Bible, pursue the truth, and are enlightened by it, the concepts within us are unconsciously and completely changed.</p>
<p>The most noticeable result of the change in our concepts is the oneness among the saints in the church. When unbelievers come to the church meetings, they marvel and say, &ldquo;This is truly an international church with all kinds of people: black, white, yellow, brown, and red. It is incredible and amazing that you can gather these five kinds of people together.&rdquo; They do not realize that this is not achieved by human effort. Our ability to be together is all due to the truth. All those who are saved have the life of the Lord, and the life within us requires us to love our brothers. However, what truly causes us to be blended as one is the truth. The truth works within us, the various kinds of people, and sanctifies our concepts. It sanctifies us to the point that we do not have our own feeling. We can no longer tell who is white, who is black, and who is brown. We all have become one new man.</p>
<p>It is the life and the sanctification by the truth that make us weighty. When we go to visit people, it does not matter whether we sit or stand, speak or remain silent. As long as we are there, people should find that we are weighty. This is a great perfecting to the home meetings. I hope that we all will pay attention to this. In addition, we have to labor. To start a home meeting and to establish it requires much labor. This cannot be achieved merely by going there for one week, two weeks, or three weeks. It requires a genuine and steadfast labor.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sowing Seeds in a Serious Way to Build Up<br />
a Proper Expression</h2>
<p>To labor is not simply to prepare a prayer or a message from <em>Life Lessons.</em> It is a preparation in many respects. In addition, we need to grasp the time and opportunity and not waste any time loosely. We should not speak excessively. However, this does not mean that we do not exchange a few words of greeting, wishing someone good health, and answering those who speak to us. The point is that when we wish someone good health, answer him, and exchange words of greeting, we need to be under a limitation and restriction. We are &ldquo;driving a car,&rdquo; and the steering wheel is in our hands. Therefore, we should not go slowly. Rather, we should make every effort to grasp the time. Whatever we speak to others should leave them with the impression that it was spoken seriously. Do not let others despise us. If someone brings up a certain matter, we should not answer it in a casual way but always answer it with assurance. Our spoken words must carry weight and value. All this requires practice.</p>
<p>To go to the home meetings once a week is a sowing; we are sowing ourselves into them. We let them observe our expression, listen to our voice, and grasp the main points of our speaking. In this way we will surely be effective. In less than half a year what we have deposited in them will be established.</p>
<p>We need to learn one other thing. After we knock on doors, bring people to salvation, and have meetings with them for a certain time, we should bring them to knock on doors with us. To perfect them in this way is marvelous. At the same time we also need to lead them to learn how to baptize people, and after baptizing people, how to make appointments with them for home meetings. All this requires us to spend much effort to lead them slowly and perfect them step by step. We should not merely learn a technique or know how to stir up the atmosphere. Concerning all these things, we need to have the knowledge and practice and keep building upon them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Learning from One Another, Studying Together, and Laboring Together</h2>
<p>We should not merely be stirred up while being short of weight, the element of life, the constitution of the truth, and even the proper laboring. We may illustrate proper laboring by sewing. If we give a length of fabric to a skilled tailor, it may take him only two hours to make a garment. However, if we give it to a man who does not know how to make clothes, he may work hard on it for half a day, not finish the garment, and even ruin the fabric; then, all his labor will be in vain. It should not be that we work hard on the home meetings, yet they eventually come to nothing. Therefore, we must determine that we need not only to learn and to practice in a common way; we also must practice from learning and learn from practicing.</p>
<p>We all know when a piece of fabric is given to us, we should not cut it in any way that we please. In the same principle, when we go to have a home meeting, we should not regard it as a light matter, thinking that it is not difficult to have a home meeting and that everyone knows how to knock on doors and open his mouth to speak. Rather, we need to learn to do these things in coordination. It is best to form a team of three persons, each of whom is a &ldquo;team leader.&rdquo; Then they all work and learn in coordination. A Chinese saying declares, &ldquo;If three of us advance together, at least one of the other two is able to be my teacher.&rdquo; The meaning of the Chinese word <em>teacher</em> indicates that regardless of who the person is, there is always something for us to learn from him. It is not that I am a master and have no more need to learn. Rather, even though others are younger, there is still something I can learn from them. If we go to labor, we should labor in this way. Whether we are young or old, when we go to have a home meeting, we need to learn from one another and study together, lest we labor in vain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STUDYING THE PRACTICAL SITUATION<br />
FOR THE GOING ON OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>When practicing to have home meetings, we often face the problem of people not welcoming us. When we go the first time, they may give us a warm face, but the second time we go, they may give us a frowning face. Then the third time, they simply may tell us that we need not come anymore. Nevertheless, we have learned endurance from the Lord. Even if people tell us not to go to their house, we still strengthen ourselves to go again. It is true that to break through barriers is difficult, but if we do not give up visiting them, the door eventually will be open to us, and there will be a way for us to go on. We all have this kind of experience. However, we should study the reasons why they do not want to receive us. Whenever we go out to practice home meetings and are rejected, we should analyze and study the reasons so that we may find a way to adjust the situation.</p>
<p>As we are taking the new way, we study while we practice and proceed, and we are prepared to make any adjustments. At the present time we have not defined the way to have a meeting. We have no definite form for either home meetings or big meetings held in the meeting hall. On the one hand, this is because we do not want to see the situation of the old way reappear, and we do not want to follow any practice according to fallen Christianity. On the other hand, we are willing to seek the Lord&rsquo;s new leading, and according to what the Bible has shown us, to experiment bit by bit and practice while learning. Therefore, concerning the matter of how small the home meeting should be and how big the big meeting should be, we are willing to do our best to study further. This is a critical moment. We are willing to have a thorough study concerning all these things so that we may have a guiding principle to go on in the future.</p>
<p>(A message given on May 5, 1987 in Taipei, Taiwan)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE HOME MEETINGS BRINGING IN<br />
AN INCREASE IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">STRENGTHENING THE HOME MEETINGS,<br />
CAUSING PEOPLE TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE<br />
TO FUNCTION ORGANICALLY</h2>
<p>The home meetings need not only to be carried out but also to be strengthened. It is not sufficient for us to have a meeting once a week for half an hour or fifty minutes according to our old method. To strengthen the home meetings is to lead the new ones to function in the meetings. In other words, it should not be we who conduct the meeting. We do not go there to lead the whole meeting from the beginning to the end. Rather, we commit the meeting to them and let them lead. In principle, we are there to strengthen them, support them, let them lead the meeting, and let them function. This is what we need to strengthen.</p>
<p>After meeting in a home for several weeks, we need to let the new ones actively lead the meeting instead of taking the initiative ourselves. It is not right if we always have to start the home meeting. We need to let the new ones start it and be active. This requires much skill. Once they start the meeting, they will function. Of course, this is not easy, just as cooking is not as easy as eating. It is easy to eat at a restaurant, but it is much trouble to cook. Everyone likes to take the easy way. However, neither an individual or a family will live long by constantly eating at a restaurant. For the health and growth of the new ones, we must spend time to help them cook for themselves.</p>
<p>God created man with many different natural characteristics, and each one has its requirement. For example, man has the characteristic of needing to eat. If this characteristic is treated improperly, it becomes sin, but the characteristic of eating itself is not sin. Man needs to drink when he is thirsty. This is also a natural characteristic, and it is not a sin. However, to become addicted to drinking wine is a sin. This applies not only to our eating and drinking but to other things as well. Our body needs exercise, but if exercise becomes a lust, it is excessive and harms the body. According to statistics, a large number of famous athletes have died young because they over-exercised and damaged their bodies. A person needs to exercise properly in order to gain the benefit from it. All this illustrates that man cannot live in contradiction to the laws created by God. Therefore, for the health and growth of the new ones, we must help them to care for the &ldquo;natural law of eating&rdquo; by functioning in the home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEGRADATION OF CHRISTIANITY<br />
NULLIFYING MAN&rsquo;S FUNCTION</h2>
<p>One brother testified that his father met in a denomination that practiced home meetings. Their result was that none of the homes knew how to meet. Because of this, the people sat there with nothing to do and not knowing what to do. After a few meetings, they stopped coming. The reason their home meetings were not successful is because in the whole of Christianity the system established from the beginning relies on big meetings. It does not require the individual saints to be able to pray, speak, testify, and function. Although many seminaries have been opened to train students of theology how to use parables and stories in sermons, none of these can meet the need of the home meetings.</p>
<p>According to our observation, no books of value have been published in the whole of Christianity during the last few decades, other than certain Greek and Hebrew lexicons, glossaries, and word studies. This is the case not only in the English-speaking world of Christianity but also in the Chinese-speaking Christian world, of which Hong Kong may be considered the center. There have been no books published with light on truths and the supply of life. Why are there no such publications? It is because Christianity throughout the last few centuries has been built on the foundation of opening seminaries and educating students of theology. However, these theological graduates have not gotten into the depths of the Bible.</p>
<p>In the past few decades since the Second World War, Christianity has not published a single book of great spiritual value. This is unlike the previous century. Beginning from 1828 when the Brethren were raised up, many spiritual books of great value were published, especially in England. However, this situation no longer exists. About sixty years ago, it was very easy to buy valuable spiritual expositions of the Bible and books on the inner life, the Holy Spirit, and the church. Such books were in abundance and were available everywhere. The reason for the decline is that instead of being built up, the whole of Christianity is being organized with various traditional methods. America is entirely a traditional Christian country. There are many church buildings, and people go to Sunday services. Many people belong to a church where they gather together to sing hymns and listen to sermons. As a result, though, there is almost no one who has the concept that he needs to function in the meeting. For singing there is the music minister, for praying there is the praying minister, and for preaching there is the preaching minister. Everyone goes to the Sunday service in a relaxed way. To be sure, among them are some devout persons, but in general all who attend the Sunday services go in a loose way without any requirements. This is the reason why Christianity has degraded to the situation it is in today.</p><h2 class="head1">THE STATISTICS OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE<br />
IN THE MAJOR DENOMINATIONS IN ENGLAND</h2>
<p>Recently a brother from England brought us a copy of the statistics of the whole of Christianity in England. Almost every group in England&mdash;whether the Catholic Church, the Baptist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church, or the Episcopal Church&mdash;has dropped in its numbers. Only one newly formed group called the &ldquo;Home Church&rdquo; is increasing in number. In England and the United States no other religion has as much influence as Protestantism and Catholicism. On April 19, 1987, the <em>Sunday Times</em> of England published a report on the number of people in the major denominations in 1970, 1980, and 1985 and included a prediction for 1990. The first denomination is the state church, the Anglican Church, which is also called the Episcopal Church or the Church of England. Their numbers were 2,500,000 in 1970, 2,100,000 in 1980, 1,980,000 in 1985, and the prediction for 1990 is 1,800,000. This shows a decreasing trend. In other words, they did not have a gain but a loss.</p>
<p>The second denomination is the Presbyterian Church. Their numbers were 1,700,000 in 1970, 1,400,000 in 1980, 1,300,000 in 1985, and the prediction for 1990 is 1,200,000. Their number is also decreasing sharply. The third one is the Baptist Church, which produced the great gospel preacher C. H. Spurgeon a century ago. The number in the Baptist Church was 870,000 in 1970, 700,000 in 1980, 640,000 in 1985, and the prediction for 1990 is 580,000. This is also a decreasing trend. The Methodist Church, also called the Wesleyan Church, being founded by John Wesley, is also included in this trend. These are the numbers in the Protestant denominations.</p>
<p>Next we come to the Roman Catholic Church. Their numbers were 2,650,000 in 1970, 2,300,000 in 1980, 2,130,000 in 1985, and the prediction for 1990 is 1,960,000. Without exception, this also shows a downward trend. As for the Pentecostal Church, there were 91,000 in 1970, 89,000 in 1980, 78,000 in 1985, and an estimate of 71,000 in 1990. Some people say that the charismatic groups are spreading rapidly and are powerful in the Western world, but in fact the charismatic group in England has decreased, not increased. Hence, even the Pentecostal and charismatic movements have had no power at all.</p>
<p>The numbers in the independent churches were 250,000 in 1970, 220,000 both in 1980 and 1985, and the prediction for 1990 remains at 220,000, showing no further increase or decrease in number. This situation may be considered to be the best one. Then we come to the Home Church. It was not in existence in 1970, but the number in 1980 was 25,000, in 1985 was 89,000, and the prediction for 1990 is 145,000. In the beginning the number was 25,000, but by 1990 it is estimated to have 145,000. From these predictions and statistics, we have an impression that we must take the way of homes. These statistics are not insignificant. Within the twenty years between 1970 and 1990, all the major sects and denominations, including the larger ones, have been decreasing in number. Without exception every one of them has displayed a downward trend. However, only the Home Church, which was not even in existence in 1970 but was recently raised up, is on the increase. This is a warning to us.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">CHANGING THE SYSTEM<br />
FROM BIG MEETINGS TO HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Therefore, we have a reason to change the system. Before the change of system, we also showed the same downward trend. This is not a small matter. Christianity has come to such a point because no one wants to labor. Everyone wants to &ldquo;go to restaurants,&rdquo; and no one wants to &ldquo;cook.&rdquo; When we first started the work in Taiwan thirty-eight years ago, we paid much attention to small groups and put emphasis on the small group meetings. Therefore, there was a constant increase and multiplication. However, gradually the small groups disappeared, and we went backward and retrograded. For this reason, we were led by the Lord to strictly correct this error by abandoning the way we practiced, changing from big meetings in the meeting hall to the meetings in the homes.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, we know that leading a home meeting is not easy. Nevertheless, there is a secret of success. We have used the illustration of eating, but we must also consider man&rsquo;s need for education. Education is not achieved by luck. A person grows not only physically but also in maturity. He must be matured to the age of twenty-five to twenty-eight before he can receive a doctoral degree. A person&rsquo;s education progresses from kindergarten, through elementary school, junior high, high school, and then college. In a sense, no one likes to take this way, because it is difficult. However, those who have the understanding of human life realize that a person must be willing to spend twenty years in studying, from kindergarten at the age of four, all the way through college or graduate research afterward. Then his education can be considered adequate.</p>
<p>Six thousand years of human culture have progressed to the state where everything begins with education. In the past even an illiterate person could work in a factory, but today to work in a factory requires a minimum of a junior high education. This compels people to pursue education. We truly respect the parents in Taiwan. They are frugal in eating and spending so that their children&rsquo;s education can be furthered. Because of this, Taiwan has advanced to where it is today. This is absolutely not by chance. This illustrates our need for continual learning in changing the system from the big meetings to the home meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">ESTABLISHING HOME MEETINGS<br />
NOT BY THE WAY OF CHANCE</h2>
<p>The reason for the decline in Christianity is that people have taken the way of chance. Spiritual giants cannot perfect many saints. Even though the charismatic movement does much promoting of miraculous healing, casting out demons, and speaking in tongues, they are still very small in number. For this reason, we must take the right way. The right way today is the homes.</p>
<p>Billy Graham, the famous preacher in Christianity, was manifested in a big convention in Los Angeles in 1948. In the past thirty-nine years, he has been all over the globe, traveling to many countries and holding numerous evangelistic meetings. However, even though he has worked in this way for thirty-nine years, the number of people in Christianity is still diminishing. The place he visited the most is England. In 1954 and 1955, he preached there every day for several months. At that time it rained very often, but people still went with umbrellas to listen to his preaching. Despite this prosperous circumstance, after thirty-nine years the number of people in Christianity is still dropping. We are not here to criticize people. We are simply pointing out the fact that we cannot take the same way.</p>
<p>The reason for our change of system is that we do not want to take the way of chance, the way of inviting famous people to give speeches. No college education has been successfully carried out merely by inviting famous people to give lectures. Every success has come about through diligent study. About forty to fifty years ago, Nankai University was a famous university in northern China. Its founder was a naval captain named Chang Po-ling. He realized that in the eyes of the international community at that time China was despised and persecuted, and the people in general were ignorant of the times, circumstances, and world situation. He felt that instead of continuing to be a naval captain, he should offer himself for the field of education. He was not merely a talented person, but he was truly for his nation and people. He ran a school in Tientsin very well, and many useful persons have come from Nankai University. We labored at that campus in Tientsin from 1935 to 1936, and it was not until we baptized a professor of physical education that we learned about this situation. Our point is that Mr. Chang carried out the work of education not by inviting famous people from all over the world to give lectures but through great effort and practical work.</p>
<p>From the age of six, we began to suffer in school. After graduating from elementary school, we suffered for another three years in junior high. After graduating from there, we suffered for yet another three or four years in high school. Then after entering into college, we still suffered for four more years. Finally with much difficulty we were produced as persons useful to the country, to society, and to our family. Today Christianity does not take this laborious way. Rather, it takes the way of chance. The result has been a drastic decline in numbers.</p>
<p>We are truly joyful that there are about one thousand young people here who are willing to serve full-time. We need to thank our government for providing a complete educational system so that many of our young people have been able to receive a high education. Our work in America was quite promising, but we left our work there to return to Taiwan. Even if we cannot call this a sacrifice, it is at least a very great price. We chose to come here because there are so many young people here who have already worked hard for sixteen years. This is very precious. They started working diligently even from kindergarten, and now they have all become useful material and have joined the procession of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is truly very encouraging. Since we are in the procession of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we should reject the degraded practice of Christianity and take God&rsquo;s ordained new way. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, we have to establish the home meetings in Taiwan and even in the whole world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOME MEETINGS BEING OUR CANAAN, THE GOOD LAND</h2>
<p>Our home meetings are not a bondage. Rather, the home meetings are pleasant and good. Our home meetings should be our Canaan, the good land. We need to endeavor not only to enter into them but also to develop them, so that every home meeting will become our Canaan, the good land. For this we need to strengthen our prayers, be strong to receive the burden, and do our best to labor on every home and strengthen every home. We should arrive early before the meeting and stay late after the meeting. We should not make a schedule to be in one home meeting for fifty minutes and then attend another meeting for another fifty minutes. If we do this, we will not be able to produce Canaan. Canaan needs to be developed, cultivated, and watered. Although the meeting is supposed to be fifty minutes, if we are willing to stay for an hour and a half, and people are happy with us and not bored, this home meeting will be successful and will have the potential to become our Canaan.</p>
<p>Someone may ask, &ldquo;What will happen if we are not able to labor on so many homes?&rdquo; Regardless of the situation, we must endeavor to labor. We must do whatever we are able to do and labor as much as we are able to labor. We ought to produce some Canaans from among the homes we care for. After putting in so much effort, we do not want to see that all the homes are unstable and that none of them is a Canaan. It would be regrettable if this were the case. We need to produce some Canaans which are stable. In addition, we should pay attention and observe to see whether we should combine a few neighboring homes to teach them how to have a small group meeting. Using this as a starting point, we should lead them to know each other and to have their own meeting. At the same time, we can lead them to have one more meeting during the week. If they have only one meeting at first, we can help them to add another one. However, we should not add too many at first. To meet twice a week is sufficient, once on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and another time during the week. This depends on how we do it. Not only so, but we must also lead them to build up a relationship with the meeting in the meeting hall. According to the district they are in, we should take them to the meeting hall to attend the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. All of this depends upon our effort. If we put in the effort, there will certainly be the result.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PANORAMIC VIEW OF GOSPELIZING TAIWAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Full-timers Working Diligently in One Accord</h2>
<p>After two terms of the full-time training, there will be two hundred fifty full-timers. After they complete their training, they will have some time off for rest. Then they will be completely &ldquo;yoked.&rdquo; However, this yoke is not a bondage; rather, it is Canaan, the good land. This good land requires us to cultivate it diligently.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some full-timers from other cities also have the burden to stay in Taipei to take care of the home meetings. Regarding this point, I hope that every one of the full-timers will seek the consent of the church from which they came, because the churches are the ones who supported the full-timers to come here. We have already heard the good news that some churches want to stand in one accord with the Lord&rsquo;s move today in gospelizing Taiwan. If there is the need for some to stay, then they may stay. If some should return to their localities, then they should go back to their respective localities. This all depends on the fellowship of the brothers.</p>
<p>This is a proper word. The original intention of the training was that the trainees should return to where they came from to serve there. Therefore, upon the completion of the training, the full-time trainees must seek the consent of the church in their locality regarding where they are to go. This is in the principle of fellowship. Of course, the majority of the churches are willing to bear the burden together in gospelizing Taiwan. After all, there is only one move of the Lord today on the whole earth. We need to spread from Taiwan to the entire earth, taking Taiwan as the center. However, on this central line, we still must keep the principle of having fellowship with every locality.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Gospelizing Cities and Communities First,<br />
Then Propagating in Towns and Villages</h2>
<p>In order to gospelize Taiwan, we must first gospelize the communities of Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, and then Tainan. After we gospelize all the communities in the big cities, we can then propagate out from the city centers to towns and villages. This is our initial blueprint.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Setting a Goal and Putting All of Our Effort<br />
into the Home Meetings</h2>
<p>Every year, there are college graduates joining the full-time service, and the training also continues every year. Through these, we need to make the homes of the new ones into Canaan. However, we should not do this in a rigid way. Instead, we should do it in an active, attractive, living, and fruitful way. The result we obtain should not be something rigid but something living and abiding as our Canaan, the good land.</p>
<p>From our past experience in leading the new ones to the corporate Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, we learned the lesson that the table meeting is short of the word of God. At the end of the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting there should be the ministering of some short messages. For example, we can first minister on the Lord&rsquo;s life and His precious blood, then on God&rsquo;s love, and third on God&rsquo;s grace. After speaking on God&rsquo;s love and God&rsquo;s grace, we can proceed with God as light as the fourth topic and then continue with God&rsquo;s Spirit, God&rsquo;s power, God&rsquo;s righteousness, and other topics.</p>
<p>We who lead the home meetings are already familiar with these messages, so we should share and minister to the new ones a little each time. This can be compared to a dessert after a feast with many delicious dishes. However, we should not serve the dessert in a rigid and inflexible way. As long as a topic is interesting to people, we can serve it according to their need without following a set rule, and we can plant that topic into them. If the Lord wills, we should supply a message every Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>We can never take the old way of degraded Christianity. Not only does history prove this, but the entire situation in today&rsquo;s Christianity also indicates this. The statistics that we saw earlier, in particular, give us a clear picture of the present trend. The result brought in by the old way of traditional Christianity has been a decline in the number of people. Hence, we must set our goal on the home meetings and labor on them. This is a fierce fight and not a small matter. The work we are doing in these days is not an easy work. To work out a foundation of the home meetings is unprecedented in the history of Christianity. This will turn the age. This is absolutely not a small matter.</p>
<p>We need to pray much more, endeavor in one accord toward this goal, and concentrate all of our strength on the home meetings. The Lord&rsquo;s work will not hold still. We will continue to study to take the home meetings further so that the Lord will have a way to accomplish His heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>(A message given on May 12, 1987 in Taipei, Taiwan)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GOAL OF THE HOME MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES<br />
TO FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD IN LIFE</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s new move today, the home meetings are a crucial matter. Through our practical experience we can say that gaining the new ones by door-knocking is not a difficult matter. However, to take care of the home meetings is not as easy. This is the heavy burden within us.</p>
<p>The primary function of the home meetings is to keep and stabilize the new ones. However, merely to keep and stabilize the new ones is not adequate. First, we must bring them into fellowship with the Lord. Second, we need to bring them into the Lord&rsquo;s Body, which is the church. This is the matter that Christianity has missed for thousands of years. Today there are many zealous Christians who serve the Lord fervently, and they are willing to pay whatever price is required. However, it appears that they do not know what fellowship with the Lord means. They may know a little about drawing near to the Lord and praying to the Lord, yet they do not know that the One who dwells in them is the Triune God. They do not know that this Triune God is processed and is already dwelling in them to be their life. This life is not separate from God, as if God is God, and the life of God is something else. Neither does it mean that the life of God is merely related to God. The Bible tells us that the life of God is simply God Himself.</p>
<p>In the New Testament there are phrases in Greek such as <em>the life of God, the love of God,</em> and <em>the power of God.</em> Such phrases indicate that the two items are one. <em>The life of God</em> means that God is life, <em>the love of God</em> means that God is love, and <em>the power of God</em> means that God is power. We can see many instances of these phrases in the Bible. First John 4:8 says that God is love, and speaking in another way verse 9 says, &ldquo;The love of God was manifested among us.&rdquo; These two ways of speaking refer to the same thing: that the love of God is God Himself. In the same way, the life of God is God Himself. However, it is not simply that God Himself was willing to be our life and that He came in a simple way to be our life. Rather, He needed to pass through many processes. Although He is God and is life, if He had not passed through many processes, He could not be our life and He would not be able to dwell in us. Therefore, He needed to pass through many processes so that He could enter into us and be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
PASSING THROUGH VARIOUS PROCESSES</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45 says that the Lord became &ldquo;a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; to dispense life into us. It is very easy for us to understand this verse to mean that God has merely given us a gift. When someone gives us a gift, the gift is the gift, and we are we; the gift and we are separate. This is a wrong understanding of dispensing. When God dispenses His life into us, He dispenses Himself into us. He is not separate from us. Moreover, for God to dispense Himself into us and enter into us to be our life, He needed to pass through various processes.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Becoming Flesh</h2>
<p>First, He needed to become a man. He was God on high in eternity, but in order to enter into man, He had to become a man. How could He become a man? It was by putting on a physical body, that is, by becoming flesh. There is a difference between the body and the flesh. The body is that which was created by God. It was sinless; it was not contaminated by sin, defiled by sin, or corrupted. Nevertheless, after the fall of man, man was contaminated and corrupted by sin inwardly, which caused the body that God created to become flesh. This is true even to the extent that the Bible calls man &ldquo;flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Genesis 6 speaks of the corruption of man. Concerning man, verse 3 says, &ldquo;For he indeed is flesh.&rdquo; This proves that the man that God created in the beginning was a man with a body but not flesh. It was at the time of Noah that man became flesh. Not only was his body flesh, but even the whole being of man was flesh. Therefore, Romans 3:20 says that out of the works of the law no flesh, that is, no man of blood and flesh, shall be justified before Him. The Greek word here denoting the man of blood and flesh is <em>flesh.</em> No flesh shall be justified before God out of the works of the law. <em>Flesh</em> refers not to the man created by God but to the man that was fallen and corrupted.</p>
<p>At the time God was incarnated, two thousand years ago, man was no longer in the condition in which God originally had created him. Man had been corrupted and had become flesh. Therefore, since God became flesh, did He become a corrupted man? Romans 8:3 says, &ldquo;God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&rdquo; When the Son of God came in the flesh, He came not merely in the likeness of the flesh but in the likeness of the flesh of sin. To be sure, Christ became flesh. However, He had only the likeness of the flesh of sin and had no reality of sin. He had the shell, the outward form, but no inward substance of sin within Him.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the bronze serpent is a type of Christ in the flesh. When the bronze serpent was lifted up on the pole, the children of Israel who looked upon the bronze serpent lived. In the New Testament the Lord Jesus said that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness and everyone who looked upon the serpent would live, &ldquo;so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:14-15). This word was uttered by the Lord Himself and proved that the bronze serpent, which Moses lifted up, was a type of Him. In Christianity we most often hear, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God.&rdquo; Many preach only that Christ is the Lamb of God. Never can we hear, &ldquo;Behold, the bronze serpent.&rdquo; The Brethren liked to interpret typology, but they also mainly preached that Christ is the Lamb of God. This is because to say that Christ is the bronze serpent seems dangerous and is irritating to the ear. Some people may even think that this is a heresy. In fact, the Bible says clearly, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&rdquo; The word<em> as</em> denotes that the Son of Man was according to the form and image of the serpent. However, He had only the likeness of the serpent. He did not have the serpent&rsquo;s poison, which is the very sin within the serpent.</p>
<p>For God to enter into us and to be our life, the first process that He went through was the process of incarnation. When God became a man, man was already corrupted and was no longer pure and complete; man had become flesh. Therefore, when the Lord was on the earth, He was not in the likeness of a pure, complete, undefiled, and uncorrupted man. Rather, He was in the form of a man who had fallen and become flesh. However, He had only the shape, the outward form of the flesh but without the inward sin. The Bible explicitly says, &ldquo;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:21). This is a sober word. God not only became flesh, but God made Christ to be sin. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;And the Word became flesh,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 5:21 says, &ldquo;Him...He made sin on our behalf.&rdquo; <em>Became</em> and <em>made</em> are used here. The One who became flesh was also made sin. However, He did not know sin and did not comprehend it subjectively. This means that He had no sin whatsoever. He was not related to sin at all, yet He was made sin. This is a mystery in the universe, and this is also the first process which God passed through.</p><h2 class="head2">Passing through Human Living</h2>
<p>Afterward, He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. He first lived in a poor carpenter&rsquo;s family in Nazareth for thirty years. When He was thirty years old, He came out of Nazareth and began to minister. While He was working as a carpenter, He was found in the likeness of a man. Philippians 2 says that He became in the likeness of men and was found in fashion as a man (vv. 7-8). When He was found by people as a man, He had the likeness not of an angel but of a man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Passing through Death</h2>
<p>Then He passed through the process of death. The process of the death of the Lord Jesus is special. He did not die on the cross in a common way. His way of passing through death was a very special process. According to the book of Colossians, while He was passing through death, there was a spiritual warfare at the cross (Col. 2:14-15). While His flesh was being put to death there, His Spirit was still working there (1 Pet. 3:18b-19). Then He entered into Hades, passed through Hades, and came out of it. When He was passing through Hades, He remained for a period of time to carry out His work there. Afterward, He came out of Hades and out of the tomb.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Entering into Resurrection</h2>
<p>When He came out of the tomb, He did not come out hastily. Instead, He came out gracefully, taking off and folding in an orderly way the linen cloths He wore in His burial. In the morning of His resurrection, the disciples went into the tomb and saw that the handkerchief and cloths were lying there in an orderly manner (John 20:6-7). This proves that He went out of the tomb calmly and gently. He came out from death and entered into resurrection.</p>
<p>After He entered into resurrection, He was still in the midst of the disciples and stayed on the earth for forty days and nights. In these forty days and nights He was within them and moved with them, yet they did not realize it. At that time the Lord&rsquo;s presence with the disciples was sometimes visible and sometimes invisible. It was sometimes manifested and sometimes hidden. When He was manifested, the disciples felt that He had come. When He hid Himself, the disciples said that He had gone. In fact, He had neither come nor gone. He was simply there, allowing them to see Him in one instance and hiding Himself in another. When two sorrowful disciples were talking on their way to Emmaus, the Lord Jesus also joined them and went along with them, asking them what they were talking about. These two disciples condemned Him and said, &ldquo;Do You alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days?&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;What things?&rdquo; They began speaking with one another and enjoyed it very much. However, these two disciples were not able to recognize that this person was the Lord Jesus (Luke 24:13-27).</p>
<p>The Lord put Himself before their eyes but did not manifest who He was. This is marvelous. They continued walking until they drew near to the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther. They constrained Him to stay there. As they were about to eat, they passed the loaf to the Lord Jesus. When the Lord Jesus broke the loaf, the eyes of the two disciples were opened and they recognized that He was the Lord. When they did not recognize the Lord, He was there. As soon as they recognized Him, He disappeared from them. The two disciples were no longer interested in eating but rushed back to Jerusalem where they found the eleven apostles and those with them assembled together. They began to fellowship with the disciples the things which had occurred. In fact, what the disciples saw was even more than what the two disciples had seen. As they were speaking these things, the Lord Jesus appeared again and stood in their midst and said to them, &ldquo;Peace to you&rdquo; (vv. 28-36). This is the condition of the Lord in resurrection.</p>
<p>Today the Lord and we have the same relationship. Sometimes He is manifested and sometimes He is hidden. Sometimes we feel that the Lord is truly with us, but sometimes we feel that we do not know where He has gone. It seems that although our circumstances are very difficult, He is not with us. Our situations are difficult, yet He does not appear to care. Nevertheless, when we feel that the Lord no longer cares for us, He appears again suddenly. This is the Lord Jesus in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD BEING PROCESSED<br />
TO ENTER INTO MEN TO BE THEIR LIFE</h2>
<p>Our God is the God who put on humanity so that divinity could be mingled with humanity as one. In addition, He completed the experience of human living, accomplished an all-inclusive death, and entered into resurrection. It is hard to tell whether such a One is physical or spiritual. You may say that He is spiritual, but He could be touched by the disciples. On the other hand, you may say that He is physical, but He was able to enter into a room where the doors were shut. After His resurrection He became such a mysterious One. Now He has put Himself into His words so that the gospel we preach and every sentence we speak is He Himself. He is in the words which we speak. When these words are spoken and when they touch the spirit of a person, this person is enlightened to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; and He enters into him. Such entering is the entering of the Triune God, the entering of God yet man, who completed human living, passed through death, and entered into resurrection. He enters into man with His human living, death, resurrection, His divinity, and His humanity, to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>When we go to lead a home meeting, it is a joyful matter if the new ones are kept and stabilized. However, this is not adequate. If we are not able to bring them into the fellowship of life, what we do is simply a work of human affiliation, a work of dealing with people&rsquo;s emotion. When we lead them in the home meetings, they enjoy it very much, and when we visit their homes, they welcome us. All this is very good, but it is not adequate. We need to bring them into the Triune God who dwells in them so that they may have the fellowship of life with Him. Merely having contact with us is not enough; they must also contact God. Merely having fellowship with us is not adequate; they must also fellowship directly with God. It is not adequate if we are the only one who fellowships with them. We must bring God along with us so that they know that there is a Triune God in us and on us. Moreover, this God is also in them, so they can fellowship with such a One in life in their daily living not only when we are there but even when we are not.</p><h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES TO EXPERIENCE<br />
THE FILLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is our burden to lead the newly saved ones to enter into this experience. However, we must also note that not every home is suitable for this. For those who have reached this stage, we need to bring them into the experience of fellowshipping with the Lord. If we want to bring people into fellowship with the Lord in life, we first need to lead them to be filled with life and to have the experience of the filling of the Holy Spirit. However, we ourselves have to be such people in the first place.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of the filling of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit fills us not only inwardly but also outwardly. In Greek the word <em>pleroo</em> is used for the inward filling, and <em>pletho</em> is used for the outward filling. One is within, whereas the other is without. This is spoken of clearly in lesson nineteen of <em>Life Lessons.</em> This lesson first shows us the two aspects of the filling of the Holy Spirit, the inward filling and the outward filling. Second, it describes the promises related to the two aspects. The promise of the outward aspect is in Joel 2:28-29 and repeated in Luke 24:49. The promise concerning the inward aspect is the one made by the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of John (14:16-17; 16:7). Following this, the lesson speaks about the functions of the two aspects, the inward filling being for life and the outward filling being for power. There are also two symbols of the two aspects. Breath and living water are the symbols of the Holy Sprit as the inward Spirit of life, and the wind and the mantle are the symbols of the Holy Spirit as the outward Spirit of power. In the evening of the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection the Lord breathed into the disciples, and on the day of Pentecost there was a rushing violent wind blowing outwardly. In addition, water is for people to drink, and a mantle is for people to be clothed with. These symbols are very meaningful. At the end of lesson nineteen, we can see the experiences of the two aspects. Not only did the Lord Jesus have the experiences of the two aspects, but the disciples also had these experiences.</p>
<p>Lesson nineteen mentions the two aspects of the Holy Spirit, and lesson twenty speaks about the inward filling of the Holy Spirit, how the Holy Spirit fills us and occupies us inwardly. First it mentions the fact of the inward filling of the Holy Spirit in us. Then it speaks of the function of the inward filling of the Holy Spirit in us and our condition after being filled inwardly. Then it talks about the way to be filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit. The ways to be filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit are by receiving the co-death with Christ on the cross, offering ourselves fully to the Lord, believing the filling of the Holy Spirit in us, and walking according to the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE<br />
THE FILLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT&mdash;<br />
CONFESSING TO THE LORD</h2>
<p>To receive the co-death with Christ on the cross and to offer ourselves fully to the Lord involve a practical matter, that is, confessing our sins. If we do not confess our sins thoroughly, it is very difficult for the Holy Spirit to have the ground in us, and we are not able to receive the co-death with Christ on the cross. Even more, we are not able to consecrate ourselves to the Lord. This is the basic matter we need to care for.</p>
<p>When we take the lead in the home meetings, we need to lead the new ones to confess their sins. There is a proper way to confess our sins. We should not confess in a general way, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, I am a sinner. Lord, You died for me and bore my sins.&rdquo; We must teach them to set aside at least one certain time to come before the Lord, personally and on their own, and say to Him, &ldquo;O Lord, I am a sinner. Shine on me. I am willing to deal with my sins thoroughly before You.&rdquo; After such a prayer, if they feel that there is any specific sin within them, they should confess it. If someone has struck his younger sister, for example, then he should also confess to her. If he has lied in the past or recently, then he should confess the sin of lying. Confession is like dusting and cleaning. Before dusting, we may not realize that there is so much dust, but the more we dust, the more the dust comes out. It seems that the more we dust, the more dust there is. Actually, it is not that there is more dust but that the dust is more apparent. After the cleaning is completed, there is no more dust; everything is clean.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confessing Thoroughly and Carefully, <br />
Not in a General and Casual Way</h2>
<p>We should not confess our sins in a casual way, like someone who cleans only the areas that can be seen and not the ones that cannot be seen. If you go to such a person&rsquo;s home, you will dare not look underneath his bed or in the corners of the house where there are piles of dust. When this person sweeps the floor, he sweeps in circles, never reaching the corners of the house. In a house like this, the edges of the sink counters are also dirty and have stains. I am afraid that we may confess our sins like a person who sweeps the floor in circles, only confessing the sins &ldquo;in the circle&rdquo; and not the sins &ldquo;in the corners&rdquo; and &ldquo;at the edges.&rdquo; That is why it seems that the more we confess our sins thoroughly, the more sins we have. In actuality, the more we confess, the fewer sins we have, but they are manifested more. At the beginning of our confession we should first draw near to the Lord and contact Him. Then when we sense that we have sins, we should begin to confess them, not only the big ones but also the small ones. The more we confess, the more we will have to confess. We must not confess in general but in detail, confessing item by item, one by one. After confessing our sins in this way, we will truly be filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly.</p>
<p>We must lead the new ones in such a way so as to help them to be filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly. We do not need to follow <em>Life Lessons</em> completely. We can guide the new ones to confess their sins according to our experience. When we lead them to confess their sins, we do not need to purposely dig out their old account but simply lead them to confess. The Holy Spirit will operate. When they have confessed one item, another item will come, one item after another, and they will continue to confess to the Lord. In this way they will touch the Spirit within. If the people we lead do not have such an experience, it is definite that they still have not entered into the fellowship of life. We must lead those we care for to such an extent that they will truly be stabilized and have a solid foundation. As they touch the Spirit within and have fellowship with the Lord within, they will live in the Lord spontaneously.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Thorough and Serious Confession<br />
Being a Personal Matter</h2>
<p>I believe that many new ones are waiting for us to bring them to this stage. We should not waste any more time or be restricted by regulations. Some homes have already reached a stage that requires us to focus on leading them until the Spirit has the opportunity and the ground to fill them within. For this, we need to pray with them, while telling them that our praying with them cannot replace their own prayers of seeking to be filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly. Anyone who seeks to be filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly must have prayers of his own, preferably with no one else present. Sometimes a person may say that he is too weak and that he needs help from others. This is right. However, no matter how much help he receives in seeking to be filled, as long as there is someone beside him, it is very hard for him to be filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly in a thorough way. Those who seek to be thoroughly filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly must confess their sins thoroughly before the Lord themselves.</p>
<p>When leading the new ones to confess their sins, we do not need to talk about many other matters. Instead, we should simply lead them to be focused and to come before God to confess their sins from within. It does not matter whether their voice is high or low, loud or quiet. What is important is to confess, one by one, the sins that they feel, sense, realize, and see. The New Testament commands us first to repent and second to confess our sins. Repenting without confessing our sins can never be thorough. We need to pay attention to the new ones we lead to see whether they have had a thorough confession of their sins after their repentance. We have to realize the importance of this matter and lead them to have an experience of the most serious and thorough confession of sins.</p>
<p>This does not mean that it is our confession alone that brings the inward filling of the Holy Spirit. It means that confessing our sins empties out our being within, allowing the Holy Spirit to gain the proper ground within us. After we have confessed our sins, we have peace within because how many sins we have confessed is how much God has forgiven us, and how many sins we have confessed is how much the precious blood of the Lord Jesus has cleansed us. The extent of the forgiveness of God is according to our confession. How much we confess is how much God forgives, how deeply we confess is how deeply God forgives, and how broadly we confess is how broadly God forgives. Following God&rsquo;s forgiveness, the precious blood of the Lord cleanses us. As we believe the forgiveness of God and receive the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood, we have peace within, and we also have the inward filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>At this time we will have a deeper feeling of the presence of the Lord and a deeper feeling of our intimate and deeper relationship with the Lord. If we can bring the new ones to such an extent, they will have fellowship with the Lord in life. One thing worth mentioning is that we need to help them to see that confession of sins and clearance of the old living are different matters. Clearance of the old living is outward; it deals with the outward matters. Sins, however, are both inward and outward. Therefore, when the new ones confess their sins, they need to deal thoroughly with both the inward and outward sins. In this way they will be filled with the Holy Spirit. This filling will bring them into the fellowship in life, and they will learn to have fellowship with the Lord.</p>

<h1 class="title">THE GOAL OF THE HOME MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>Colossians 1:27-29 says, &ldquo;To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE TRUTH<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us already has a history of over sixty years. In the beginning our scale was very small, the situation was very difficult, and what the Lord had shown us was very limited. Gradually, however, over the last sixty years we cannot say that we saw something new every day, but we certainly have seen something new each year. In particular, for thirty-eight years the Lord has led His recovery overseas, and in these years the Lord has shown us very many new things. Most recently, through fourteen years of labor since 1974, the Lord has led us to complete the life-study of the New Testament from Matthew to Revelation, and He has used us to finish the footnotes of the entire New Testament.</p>
<p>It is evident to us that the knowledge of the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is clear and complete. This is shown in the truth and light from hymn #450 in the Chinese Hymnal. The following is a literal translation of this hymn:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>What God is in truth to man hinges on the spirit;<br />
In his spirit man must touch the essence <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God&rsquo;s Spirit<br />
To experience God.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit begets spirit, spirit worships the Spirit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that the Spirit fills me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit also has become the word with life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abundant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowing out as rivers of living water.<br /><br /></li>
<li>God is Spirit and He created man with a spirit<br />
That with his spirit man may worship the Spirit;<br />
In this way man can receive Him as life<br />
And take Him as his supply.<br /><br /></li>
<li>As the Spirit, God enters into man&rsquo;s spirit<br />
For man to be regenerated;<br />
Thus, man can fellowship with Him in spirit<br />
And enjoy His riches.<br /><br /></li>
<li>As the Spirit, God fills me, waters me, refreshes me,<br />
Transforms and renews me,<br />
Until He spreads from my spirit to my whole body,<br />
Saturating my entire being.<br /><br /></li>
<li>As the Spirit, God is blended and mingled with me<br />
For the transfiguration of my body;<br />
His element continually increases in me<br />
Until He is manifested.<br /><br /></li>
<li>All of God&rsquo;s riches are in the Spirit<br />
For me to experience and enjoy;<br />
I must breathe in God constantly in my spirit<br />
To enjoy all that God has.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was after this hymn was written that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States. Therefore, when the Lord&rsquo;s recovery reached the United States, the truth, knowledge, and experience of life had already reached a level of maturity. Today we are here studying the new way. In terms of the truth, we are adding nothing to what we have seen. However, in terms of the practice of the truth and the real increase and spread of the church, we have had certain discoveries. Therefore, we are very concerned for those who have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for many years. It is a pity if they have not been following what the Lord has shown us at this time. Without a doubt, those who have not followed are a big step behind.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INFLUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>Prior to October of 1984, we practiced the truth, preached the gospel, established churches, and lived the church life. However, that view and that realm were not broad enough, causing us to suffer a great loss. In what matters did we suffer loss? First, we had almost no expanding, increase, and spread. Due to the damage caused by the poison of the practice in Christianity of one man speaking and all others listening, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has not propagated and expanded much for many years. Although most of us were not born in Christianity or raised up in Christianity, the religious power of Christianity has permeated the whole earth and greatly affected our living.</p>
<p>Today the whole world takes the Lord&rsquo;s Day as a holiday. A person does not need to be a Christian, understand the truth, or read the Bible, but he can still keep the so-called Sunday service. In addition, celebrating Christmas, hanging up Christmas lights, giving out Christmas cards, and having Christmas parties are all part of Christianity&rsquo;s influence. In actuality those who practice this may not be Christians. Before a person comes to know Christ, he is already influenced by Christianity. Then when he is saved and comes into the church, he spontaneously brings in the worldly things from Christianity.</p>
<p>Today there are many new ones among us. After we baptize them, they desire to go to a big chapel to attend a service. If we lead them only to have meetings in their homes, they will not feel that this is what they expect of Christianity. Even if we bring them to the meeting hall, they may look around and wonder where the bell, the cross, the pastor, and the choir are. If they do not find these things, they may feel puzzled. This shows us that the thick atmosphere of Christianity has not only attacked us but also permeated us.</p>
<p>Beginning from Brother Nee, we have felt like security guards on duty, fearing that if we doze off slightly, something improper will come in. In the eighteen years that Brother Nee was with us, we saw his many sufferings and frustrations. He was like a big umbrella covering us, causing us all to be under his protection. The rain could not fall on us, the sun could not scorch us, and the wind could not blow upon us. At that time the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was greatly troubled from within and without. From time to time someone would open all the doors and windows to the rain, or even tear down the ceiling altogether. It seemed that every negative thing entered into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Sometimes it was an opinion that came in, and at other times it was a certain method. However, we were all under the covering of Brother Nee.</p>
<p>After 1949 we came to Taiwan. The condition there often caused us to grieve. Those who were meeting with us seemed to open the doors from every side, and it was not easy for us as the &ldquo;security guards&rdquo; to know what was happening. Because of this, the deadness of Christianity damaged us in a widespread way. The way of Christianity is first to completely nullify the function of the members of Christ. Second, it is to thoroughly abolish the strength of the activity in the Body of Christ, causing every member of the Body to be bound. This way and atmosphere invisibly, unconsciously, and secretly crept into our midst. As a result, this caused us to be almost the same as Christianity in that the members rarely functioned and had no way to function. Thus, there was not much multiplication and increase.</p>
<p>In this kind of atmosphere, not only were many not alerted to the situation, but they even thought that they were being helped. When they came to a big meeting, it seemed that everything necessary was there. Coming to the meetings was their enjoyment. There was no place better than the meeting hall. It was quiet and peaceful, and there were prayers, singing, and preaching. This seemed very good to them. After working for six days, they could finally manage to put away all of their business affairs and take a break. When they came to the meeting hall, they did not need to function but could simply sit there and say amen. Then the more they said amen, the more they enjoyed it and the more they were relieved inwardly. How good this seemed to be! At most, they only needed to take out a portion of their monthly salary and drop it into the offering box. This too was very easy. Now meeting in the new way takes away one man speaking and all others listening. Not only do people need to open their homes for meeting, but the whole family, from young to old, is now forced to function, and they must open their mouths to sing and pray. How hard this now seems! These are two kinds of conditions and two kinds of feelings. Therefore, many people prefer the big meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR PRESENT PRACTICE&mdash;<br />
PREACHING THE GOSPEL THROUGH DOOR-KNOCKING<br />
AND ESTABLISHING HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>If we all choose the old way, how can the church propagate? How can our numbers increase? We all may be zealous to preach the gospel to bring people to salvation, but after people are baptized, what should we do? If all that we have are big meetings, how can people remain? This is the reason that when we led people to be saved in the past, after we gave birth to someone, he would die, and those who remained were few. Therefore, according to the actual condition, we studied and discovered this practical need. The results we found are first that there must be a way to allow the gospel to enter into people and to allow the Lord to gain them. The second result is not as easy; it is the way for those who are saved and baptized to remain.</p>
<p>According to these two needs, the Lord has had mercy on us and shown us that the best way to gain people is through preaching the gospel by knocking on doors from house to house and baptizing them in their homes. In addition, after people are baptized, we should immediately establish a meeting in their home. Then in this way they will remain. All Christian preachers, regardless of which denomination they are in, admit that leading people to believe in the Lord is not easy and that bringing them into the church after they believe is more difficult even than climbing a mountain. Therefore, the Lord has shown us these two points: First, we must bring the gospel to people&rsquo;s homes for their salvation, and second, we must bring the meetings to their homes for their edification.</p>
<p>After two years of experimenting, the practice of visiting people by door-knocking and preaching the gospel to lead them to be saved and baptized has been successful. However, according to our observation, our way to have the home meetings still needs further study.</p><h2 class="head1">THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF DOOR-KNOCKING&mdash;<br />
BEING IN ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>Before she was saved, a certain young sister was injured by someone, so she called some drug dealers to go to that person&rsquo;s home to deal with him. However, after she hung up the phone, some saints knocked on her door. The saints went in, and after they talked to her, she was very joyful. Then she called those evil people and stopped them.</p>
<p>Another person testified that through door-knocking the Lord saved his mother-in-law, his wife, and the three other daughters of his mother-in-law, and they all were baptized. Another one testified that one of his neighbors was about to commit suicide, and another neighbor was about to be divorced. Due to the visiting and door-knocking of the saints, however, they and their families were all rescued. These are a few real cases. Therefore, without a doubt, visiting by door-knocking gains people.</p>
<p>However, please bear in mind that the saints themselves must first be trained, and the localities where the saints are must be in one accord, or if a certain locality does not have a church, there must be three to five there who are in one accord. We must realize that when there is even a small opinion, that opinion will thoroughly kill us. We all have had this experience. When we practice visiting by door-knocking, if a team of three are not one and have different opinions, our work will immediately lose its impact. However, if we are in one accord, praying together and heading in one direction, the blessing will immediately come.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH LIFE IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
HAVING MANY ASPECTS</h2>
<p>The church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is rich and attractive in many ways. In the church life there are many different opportunities and services that are truly encouraging. Now we also have door-knocking, baptizing people, and practicing the home meetings. This is the other aspect of the church life. However, this new aspect is not to replace the existing aspect but rather to perfect it.</p>
<p>To be sure, the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has many aspects. In the past we were veiled so that we saw only the meetings in the meeting hall. If the number of people increased, we would set up a district meeting for the sake of convenience to accommodate everyone. We had only this view with no concept that it is even better for the saints to meet in their homes. Now the Lord has shown us that having only the first aspect of the church is not adequate. We must also have this newly developed aspect. Once we have this newly opened area, we will have two aspects of condition, perspective, and feeling. However, to not handle these two aspects properly will cause problems. The hearts and eyes of those who practice door-knocking and home meetings may be completely focused on that one side, but those who are practicing the existing aspect may not be able to shed the old practices. The result may be a situation of opposing one another, causing both sides to suffer. On the one hand, the new way will not break through, and on the other hand, the old way will be damaged. In the end, both aspects will be hurt, and no one will benefit. We must be mindful of this eventuality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO &ldquo;WINGS&rdquo; OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Today we are receiving the burden to open up and strengthen the new aspect, and gradually there will be a trend for the new to replace the old. However, this does not mean that when the old aspect is replaced by the new, the old will be completely abandoned. This is not the case. We may use a 747 jet airplane as an illustration. This airplane has two wings, one on the right and one on the left. If it had only one wing, it would certainly have problems. It requires two wings for balance. Similarly, the big meetings are one wing, and the small meetings are the other wing. There are these two aspects, and the Bible contains examples of both. On the one hand, there were the home meetings from house to house, while on the other hand, there were times for the whole church to meet together (Acts 2:46).</p>
<p>The home meetings are almost like the regular daily meals in the homes, but what 1 Corinthians 14:26 speaks about is the time for the whole church to meet together, which is not as frequent as the home meetings. To meet in a big meeting every day is not easy, but to meet in a small meeting every day, or even twice a day, is affordable. Due to our old habits, we do not often meet in the morning. However, today in the new aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we need to arrive at the point that we have meetings even in the morning, since for some people it is not convenient to meet at other times. In the practice of the new way, we must always progress and study.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROGRESS OF THE NEW WAY<br />
COMPRISING A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW</h2>
<p>Today the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should balance all of us so that we may have a comprehensive view. I believe that in a few years the multiplication and increase in the church will develop to the point that even if you are in the church here, you will not be able to know what is happening in all the meeting halls. At that time, the methods of the old way will become completely unsuitable. The old way is suitable only for the old environment. Now in the new environment only the new way is applicable. We will also gradually see that even the ones in the home meetings are not all the same. Some will like to meet in the meeting hall, while others will prefer not to go to the meeting hall. However, for someone not to meet in the meeting hall does not mean that he does not acknowledge the church. Such a one still acknowledges the church, but he prefers meeting in the homes.</p>
<p>Such situations have already come into being in the home meetings. We cannot &ldquo;pull up a seedling, hoping to make it grow faster,&rdquo; that is, to force or drag a new one to the meeting hall. This is not right. Even though he does not come to the meetings in the meeting hall, he still meets in the homes and does not go to the denominations or participate in other organizations; this is already a good situation. We simply need to supply the new ones with the truth, help them in life, take care of them in their daily life, and let them lead their home meetings. In this way they will spontaneously be perfected in the truth, grow in life, and remain in the church life. This is what we are after, and it is what we are currently practicing.</p>
<p>Because of this need, in every Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, and even before or after the prayer meeting, we should minister a short message that is full of life and light (which is the truth). This will enable those in the meeting to be perfected in every way.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR VIEW NEEDING TO BE BROADENED<br />
IN SPREADING THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>In short, we should all the more spread the truth and not neglect it. Here is a big problem, to which we all must pay attention. In our propagation we cannot be blind and limit ourselves to only one way. For example, some homes want to cover <em>Life Lessons,</em> some want to cover <em>Truth Lessons,</em> and some want to cover the life-studies. We have no way to unify all these different situations, and we do not need to unify them. Every household eats rice, but each one is different; some eat fried rice, while some eat rice soup. I hope we will all be clear about this. When we go out, we must learn to broaden our view and not limit ourselves.</p>
<p>In order to spread and propagate, we must not limit ourselves to one way. Neither should we anxiously expect a person to improve or a family to change. This is not necessary. We need to learn to accept different ways and different conditions. If some homes love the life-studies, let them read the life-studies. If other homes love <em>Truth Lessons,</em> let them use <em>Truth Lessons.</em> Let them decide on their own and do it on their own. Then they will be perfected and edified.</p>
<p>In this way the church life in the future will have not a few but many aspects and directions. This requires us to have a comprehensive view in handling the church life. According to the practical situation, no one person can handle that many different situations. This requires all of us to bear them together. However, although the situations may be different, we must be absolutely one in believing in the Bible, the Triune God, Jesus Christ, the need to receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Lord, the uniqueness of the Body of Christ, and the oneness of the expression of the Body in the different local churches. These are the things we all must absolutely hold. In matters other than these, however, our view needs to be enlarged.</p>
<p>We may observe the situation of the churches in the book of Acts. After Acts, from Romans to Revelation, the situations of the churches in the Epistles were not the same, but their faith was absolutely one. On God&rsquo;s side, the faith is related to the Bible as the Word of God, the revelation of God, the Triune God, and Jesus being God and the Son of God who died and resurrected for us. On man&rsquo;s side, the faith is the belief that we must be saved by the forgiveness of sins and regenerated to have God&rsquo;s life, that Christ has only one Body, and that the expression of this one Body in every locality is also one. This is our faith. Concerning items other than these, whether regarding the breaking of bread or the other practices in the church life, we do not insist on anything.</p>
<p>We may compare the churches to the faces that God created for man. Not any two faces are the same. Everyone has his own face, which is different from all other faces. We can tell the difference between the faces of identical twins. There are also differences in complexion and color; some faces are black, while others are white, red, or brown. The colors may all be different, but in general, the faces are still the same. Similarly, in the church life every home may have a different appearance, but the principle in each one is the same. Each home still has &ldquo;two eyes, two ears, two lips, and one nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is also the same with eating. People from different countries, and sometimes people even from the same country, do not all eat the same thing. Some like milk and sandwiches, some like soymilk and fried buns, and some like porridge and vegetables. We cannot impose the same foods on everyone. In the church life, some like <em>Truth Lessons,</em> some like <em>Life Lessons,</em> and some like the life-studies. What we eat may be different, but the &ldquo;vitamins&rdquo; in them are all just as nutritious.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRESENTING EVERY MAN FULL-GROWN IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Today those in the younger generation are the representatives of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. They are the &ldquo;core&rdquo; members, the successors in the recovery. I hope that when they rise up to take the burden of the recovery, their view will not be narrow but as wide as the universe. They must allow their view to be enlarged to the uttermost.</p>
<p>It is not a small matter to be able to have the Lord&rsquo;s table in every home and for every home to say amen to our coming. Concerning the future prospect of the church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the truth is absolutely unchangeable, but the outward practices will greatly change. The age of the ox cart has gone, and the age of the 747 has arrived. Similarly, in three to five years we will see that the situation in the church will be significantly different, although the truth will remain absolutely unchanged. Regardless of how meals change over time, the food created by God with its nutritious elements and essences remains unchanged. May we all see this.</p>
<p>We need to reach the point that the home meetings, big meetings, small meetings, and every kind of meeting all have the same principle, which is to announce Christ. We announce Him in all wisdom, not only with <em>Truth Lessons</em> or with <em>Life Lessons,</em> but in all wisdom and every kind of wisdom. We not only announce Him, but we even admonish and teach every man that we may present every man full-grown, complete, and perfect in Christ to God. This is the goal of our home meetings.</p>
<p>(A message given on May 26, 1987 in Taipei, Taiwan)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SECRET TO THE SUCCESS<br />
OF THE NEW WAY</h1>
<p>We shall consider two passages of the Scriptures. The first is Colossians 1:27-29, which says, &ldquo;What are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.&rdquo; The second passage is 2 Corinthians 4:1, 2 and 5, which says, &ldquo;Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart; but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God....For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRESENTING EVERY MAN FULL-GROWN IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>In these passages of the Scriptures, Paul shows us not only the mystery of God hidden throughout the ages but also the all-inclusive Christ. Moreover, he shows us how the apostles carried out the ministry and accomplished the mysterious work of God on earth. In Colossians 1:27 he says, &ldquo;What are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; Some versions translate the latter phrase as &ldquo;Christ in us.&rdquo; These translations may come from different manuscripts, but they both make sense. On the one hand, <em>you</em> refers to the New Testament readers; on the other hand, <em>us</em> refers to the apostles at that time. Paul then goes on to say, &ldquo;Whom we announce...in all wisdom.&rdquo; Paul uses all his wisdom to announce Christ. His announcing is not according to a single kind of method or speaking. Rather, it is multilayered, multifaceted, and multidirectional. He exhausts all of his wisdom not only to announce but also to admonish every man and teach every man, that he may present every man full-grown in Christ.</p>
<p>The word <em>full-grown</em> includes being perfect, complete, and grown up. In Greek this word basically means &ldquo;grown up unto maturity.&rdquo; When a person grows up unto maturity, that is the time he is perfect and complete. This is Paul&rsquo;s meaning in this verse. He preached Christ to others, hoping that one day they would grow up unto maturity and become perfect and complete. <em>Perfect</em> denotes full in quality, whereas <em>complete</em> denotes full in quantity. To be full-grown is to be completely perfect, without any lack in quality or quantity. If there is a blemish in a precious stone, it is not perfect, and if it is lacking a corner, it is not complete. A precious stone must be pure within and have no blemish; this is to be perfect. However, for the stone to be perfect does not necessarily mean that it is complete. Only if the stone is properly faceted without the slightest flaw can it be considered complete. Being perfect and complete in Christ is the result of growth in life. Hence, Paul says that we need to present men to Christ in this manner, that is, to present them full-grown in Christ. This is the ultimate goal of Paul&rsquo;s ministering to people.</p>
<p>In verse 29 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For which also I labor.&rdquo; Here Paul uses the word <em>labor,</em> not merely <em>work.</em> To labor means to toil at a difficult task. Any kind of job that requires laboring is not an easy one. An easy job does not require us to labor. Paul labored &ldquo;according to His operation which operates in me in power.&rdquo; What kind of power is this? This is the power that is activated within us and continues to operate in us. Furthermore, Paul adds that he was struggling according to this power. The Greek word for <em>struggling</em> is used to describe the struggling, contending, wrestling, and fighting of athletes in the Olympic games. The Lord Jesus said in John 18:36, &ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling.&rdquo; To struggle indicates a battle. Hence, this is a strong word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HOPING FOR EASE AND COMFORT<br />
IN SERVING THE LORD</h2>
<p>As we all know, people like pleasure but not suffering. However, today we cannot serve Christ on a sedan chair. There is no such thing, and there is no such chair. Paul in the New Testament was one who struggled, like the contenders in athletic contests (1 Cor. 9:26-27). He boxed, not as though beating the air, and he ran the race ahead of others in order to win. If his struggling were like weight lifting, then he must lift clean and high. This was the nature of his struggling. Jude 3 exhorts the believers to earnestly contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints. This shows us that we need not only to struggle but also to contend for the faith. All these meanings are included in <em>struggling.</em></p>
<p>In Matthew 25 the Lord Jesus spoke a parable concerning the kingdom of the heavens. The kingdom is like a man who was about to go abroad, called his own slaves, and delivered to them his possessions. To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one. Later the master returned, and the one who had received one talent, the cautious one, came before him and said, &ldquo;Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow. And I was afraid&rdquo; (vv. 24-25a). It is as if he were saying, &ldquo;O master, behold, your one talent is still intact; I kept it for you and did not lose anything.&rdquo; The master seemed to reply, &ldquo;You are absolutely right. Since you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow, then why did you not use the one talent to earn interest? Why did you hide it?&rdquo; For that slave, earning interest was a psychologically taxing job. It seemed best for him not to do anything and not to move anywhere. This person had completely lost his morale. The master said to him, &ldquo;You should have deposited my money with the money changers; and when I came, I would have recovered what is mine with interest&rdquo; (v. 27). If we are those willing to struggle for the Lord, the Lord will be able to gain much and even recover what is His with interest.</p><h2 class="head1">A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK IN THE UNITED STATES</h2>
<p>Today the earth is in desolation. Although there is a general preaching of the gospel, there is no gospel concerning the hidden mystery or the high gospel concerning Christ in us. It is no easy task to open up a wasteland, but it is an indisputable fact that there are millions of people scattered in every major continent of the world, waiting for people to save their souls. It is a glorious matter for us to go out for the Lord. On the one hand, we reap the harvest wherever we go. Although we are not the ones who sowed, the Lord has already sown through others, so all we need to do is to reap. On the other hand, we ourselves need to go out to sow the seeds. Then after we sow the seeds, there will certainly be a harvest.</p>
<p>We had this experience when we began our work in America. We traveled from the east coast to the west coast, and from the west back to the east. We also traveled from south to north and from north to south. Within a few years, our traveling covered most of America, and we reaped a harvest in almost every place. There were three to five persons in one state, five or six in another, and others elsewhere. In less than two years, we reaped many people here and there in each state. When the church in Los Angeles was raised up, the numbers increased quickly from tens of people to a hundred people, from one hundred to one hundred fifty, and then from one hundred fifty to two hundred. These persons were brought in during 1963, 1964, and no later than 1965 when the work in the United States first began. Eventually in 1970 at the International Conference in Los Angeles, a revival was ushered in as a result of our meetings.</p>
<p>The fire of our spread began in the summer of 1964. Some wanted to move to Alaska, some to Nebraska, and some to other places. At that time the tide of migration was so prevailing that many did not know how to respond. However, the Lord clearly showed us that it was not yet the appropriate time to spread. Hence, the Lord gave us grace to stay where we were for another three years. Those three years were truly a wonderful period in which we all became better equipped.</p>
<p>In 1970 the number of people who attended the International Conference exceeded one thousand. During this year everyone wanted to spread out through migration. Many of the saints were praising and leaping, although they were also shedding tears, being reluctant to depart from Los Angeles. On the day they left Los Angeles, some made a detour from their homes to the meeting hall on Elden Street to catch a last glimpse, and they could not hold back their tears. They were richly blessed and edified there, and Elden had left an eternal impression on them. That wave of migration resulted in the spread to between twenty and thirty localities, such as Chicago and other places. This migration proceeded quickly and had a great impact. In not more than two years, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery had reached two to three thousand people. In a conference at the Los Angeles Convention Center in 1973, the number of attendants exceeded three thousand. Large crowds gathered both inside and outside of the meeting place. From that day onward, our concept was changed. We realized that we should no longer hold big conferences but that we should begin to conduct trainings. Big conferences are open in nature, and anyone could join, but trainings required a process of approval. Therefore, since 1974 we have conducted trainings twice a year. People have had to register and be approved by the various churches. That was the beginning of the life-study training. We praise the Lord that this has gone on for thirteen years without interruption.</p>
<p>History shows us that what we have today is precious. Therefore, we should go everywhere with boldness. When we first arrived in the United States to begin our work here, we could not say that there was no opposition in such a large Christian nation. Nevertheless, we have maintained a positive attitude until this day. It is not the case that there has been no opposition. Rather, there have been all kinds of opposition. However, whenever we engage in a conversation with an opposer, our attitude is always that no matter what they say, we have a treasure that they do not have. As we speak with them, we present to them the truth that the Lord has revealed to us. We can show them the treasure at any time. However, when the opposers want to display their treasure, they have nothing to show. This is the real situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECRET TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">According to the Operation of His Power in Us</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether you are old or young, you should have a realization that there is a power in us. If you want to lead an easy life, I must tell you that this is impossible. If an appliance could talk, it may ask the electricity to pause for a while and allow it to have a good rest. However, electricity has no way to pause. For this reason, Paul told us to struggle. In 1963 or 1964, a brother from the Brethren assembly came from the United States to Taiwan. In Taichung he met a Western missionary who was also in the Brethren assembly. As they began to converse, he compared the missionary work of the Brethren assembly there to a drop of water on a fingertip, and our work in Taiwan to a bucket of water. This brother said that no one could outrun us, and no one struggled as much as we did.</p>
<p>I have been laboring in the United States for twenty-three years, and I have never taken a vacation. This surprises the Americans. Whether they are in school or at work, Americans go on vacation several times a year. Therefore, they find me strange because I work all day continuously and never plan a vacation. The more I read the New Testament, the more I wonder if Paul ever had a vacation. Even if he went on vacation outwardly, he could not be on vacation inwardly. He said that there was a crowd of cares pressing upon him daily, the anxious concern for all the churches (2 Cor. 11:28). This passage of the Scriptures not only encourages us, but above all it points to us a way, showing us that Paul not only had a treasure but that this treasure had become a mighty power within him. He showed us particularly that he was one who struggled. If we were to go on a vacation, this operating power would leave us. Therefore, although we have a power operating within us, we still have to endeavor to strive and struggle. We should not fear any opposition. All we have to do is bring the treasure with us and struggle day and night to present this treasure to others.</p>
<p>Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:7 that he had a treasure within him. This treasure in him was not dull and dormant, but rather it was an operation, an operating power. The word <em>dynamo,</em> which we derive from the Greek word for <em>power,</em> is used to describe the operating force of electricity. This indicates that the treasure within us is full of energy. Nevertheless, Paul says that he still needed to struggle to present this treasure to others. We all have read the fourteen Epistles written by him, which reveal the wonderful riches of the truth. However, the process of writing these fourteen Epistles was filled with much labor and hardship. We may compare this labor to the operation of the jewelry and jade shops in Hong Kong. The shops may be full of precious jewels, but if the shop owner is slothful, and the front of the store is a mess, no one will want to go in and buy the jewels. The shop owner still needs to furnish the shop so that it looks elegant and graceful and displays the treasures in a way that others will see that they are of high value. All this requires much time and effort.</p><h2 class="head2">Laboring and Struggling in Each Locality</h2>
<p>We should not be afraid of hardships when we serve in each locality, because we have the treasure. If we add to the treasure our labor and struggle, I believe that the whole earth will be ours. After being gained by the Lord, a certain brother of Jewish descent traveled not only throughout the United States but also to Taiwan. He was not afraid of any opposition. All he did was bring the treasure with him faithfully and go everywhere to present it to others. Many people saw his struggle, and as a result he gained many young people. It does not matter how difficult the environment is. The key to success is first a matter of having the treasure and the operating power in us. Second, it depends on whether or not we are willing to labor and struggle. If we have the above two factors, we will be successful no matter where in the world we go.</p>
<p>We have come in contact with many people in the United States. In particular, when we speak with the opposers, they feel that there is not much that they can do to us. This is because we are absolute, not in our intent to please Christianity but in following and speaking the truths in the Bible. Today there are many in Christianity both in the Far East and in the United States who use our materials for preaching. They admit that the exposition of the Bible today cannot surpass that in the local churches.</p>
<p>At the time Paul came out to preach the gospel, the Lord had used the Roman Empire to open the area around the Middle East. At that time a person such as Paul could travel anywhere as long he was a Roman citizen. Similarly, after passing through two world wars, the world has been opened up. In addition, as long as a person can speak English, he can go almost anywhere in the world. This shows us that the Lord has prepared the environment. Now He needs people to cooperate with Him. As long as we bring with us the treasure, such as the Recovery Version of the New Testament, and add to it our labor and struggle, success will certainly be ours.</p>
<p>Those who are serving full-time in various localities should continue to go door-knocking, gaining at least one person every week. This adds up to four persons by the end of each month. In this way there will be five persons who can start a meeting. This is the fastest way of raising up churches. With regard to finances, we should not have the intention of receiving a supply from others. We should never depend on others but rather make a living with our two hands by taking a simple job. Today there are many churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and they will not forsake you, but you should not have the intention to rely on them. Rather, you must labor and struggle. This will eventually produce results.</p>
<p>As we all know, life and death are not in our hands. Even a strong man may not live to see another day. Therefore, we should strive to work more for the Lord today. A slothful person will not gain anything, but if we are diligent to seize the time, opportunities and success will be in our hands. We all have the treasure and the mighty power within us. What we need now is not to live a life in &ldquo;paradise&rdquo; but rather to go to various localities to labor, struggle, work the mystery of God into others, and let the mystery of Christ shine forth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Manifesting the Truth without Losing Heart</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:1-2 says, &ldquo;Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart; but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God.&rdquo; Paul says that he did not lose heart. The Greek word for <em>lose heart</em>is broad in meaning. It means to be disappointed, discouraged, and hopeless. Therefore, wherever we are, we should not be disappointed or discouraged; we should not lose heart. The most important thing to bear in mind after we have received this ministry is that we should not lose heart. There is nothing that should cause us to lose heart. As long as we endeavor, there will be a way. Moreover, we must renounce the hidden things of shame. On the one hand, we do not lose heart, but on the other hand, we also need to abandon, renounce, the hidden things of shame. There should be nothing about us that cannot be disclosed. Whether we are in front of people or among the coordinating ones, we must have nothing to hide. Everything must be open and apparent before men. We do not lose heart, and we also need to renounce the hidden things of shame.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should not walk in craftiness. Wherever we are, we need to ask the Lord to make us able to boast that we never play tricks or politics. We may disagree with people, but we cannot say one thing outwardly while thinking another thing behind their back. This is to walk in craftiness. Craftiness may be compared to covering a corpse with snow. When the sun comes out, the snow melts, and the corpse is exposed. When a person tells a lie, it is impossible for his lie to remain unexposed.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Nor adulterating the word of God.&rdquo; It is a great mercy given to us by the Lord that not only do we not adulterate the word of God, but we also release and strengthen the word of God. Because we do not adulterate the word of God in any way, Christianity objects to us. To adulterate is not merely to add something evil. It is to add a small amount of a substance to something precious, like adding water to a glass of pure grape juice or like mixing copper with gold. We never sell the truth cheaply, and we never adulterate the word of God. Rather, &ldquo;by the manifestation of the truth&rdquo; we commend ourselves to &ldquo;every conscience of men before God.&rdquo; This is to allow others&rsquo; conscience to speak for us. We all should have this experience.</p>
<p>Moreover, we also see from verse 5 that we do not preach ourselves. Instead, we preach two things&mdash;&ldquo;Christ Jesus as Lord&rdquo; and &ldquo;ourselves as your slaves for Jesus&rsquo; sake.&rdquo; When we go out, we should not give people the impression that we are exalted persons. Instead, we should give them the impression that we are their slaves, preaching Christ Jesus as Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord not only reveals to us the mystery of God but also shows us that this mystery is both on the Lord&rsquo;s side and on ours. He is the power operating within us. Although we cannot do anything, we can cooperate by laboring, and we can run ahead of the rest. We can labor in our work and struggle, and the more we struggle, the more the Lord empowers us. Hence, the more we struggle, the stronger we are. We should remain in the Lord&rsquo;s empowering and labor to move ahead by faith.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>As human beings, if we do not believe in Jesus, we feel empty and meaningless. Some people have attained doctorate degrees, become high-ranking officials, and even become affluent, but they feel that life is meaningless. Therefore, as men we should believe in Jesus. Moreover, after a person has believed in Jesus, he must love the Lord. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 16:22, &ldquo;If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed!&rdquo; This word is very serious but very real. As men we should believe in Jesus, and after believing in Jesus we should love Him and labor for Him. If we submit to this destiny, everything will go smoothly. Then even though we may labor, we will not feel it. On the contrary, we may feel distressed if we do not labor. This truly is our experience.</p>
<p>I hope that the elders in particular will stop fighting to free themselves from the yoke given to them by the Lord. The Lord told Paul in the New Testament that it was hard for him to kick against the goads (Acts 26:14). It is better if we do not kick, because the more we kick, the more distressed we become. All those who are elders have received a commission from the Lord. This is not a small matter; it is a great matter accomplished by the Lord. If we regard the church as a Christian organization, we may think that it is of little importance. Instead, we must realize that this is the church of the Lord. Since we have been shown mercy to receive this ministry, we should not belittle all these things. In addition, we have also seen that there is a power within us, and now what we need is simply to labor and struggle. If the elders are able to labor and struggle together, the entire church will be on fire and on the move.</p>
<p>(A message given on June 13, 1987 in Taipei, Taiwan)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE MINISTERS AND THE MINISTRY<br />
OF THE NEW COVENANT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT<br />
BEING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:6 says, &ldquo;Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit.&rdquo; We should note that this verse speaks of ministers and not ministry. Ministry is different from the ministers. Ministry refers to the work, whereas the ministers are the persons, just as elders and deacons are persons. In Chinese we sometimes add the word <em>many</em> in order to distinguish the two words, speaking of the &ldquo;many ministers&rdquo; of the new covenant. This is correct because in verse 6 <em>ministers</em> is plural.</p>
<p>According to 2 Corinthians 3, the ministers of the new covenant are not of the letter. <em>Letter</em> conveys many meanings. In literal terms, it refers to the words in black and white. With regard to its intrinsic meaning, it refers to the dead scripture. <em>Letter</em> in this chapter does not refer to the New Testament, because at that time the New Testament had not yet been written. Instead, it refers to the Old Testament, in particular, the Scriptures written on stone tablets. The meaning of <em>letter</em> also includes dead knowledge. The knowledge that comes from the dead letter is also considered as letter. Moreover, <em>letter</em> also refers to ordinances. Today as the many ministers of the new covenant we are not of the dead ordinances, the dead scripture, or the dead knowledge. Instead, we are of the Spirit. Our every work and our walk, whether to go door-knocking, bring people to salvation, baptize people, or conduct home meetings, require us to be men of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CULTIVATION OF<br />
THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Keeping the Outward Letter<br />
but Cultivating the Inner Life</h2>
<p>Our problem lies in this&mdash;that our spiritual level is too poor. We may do many things outwardly, such as pray, confess our sins, and seek the filling of the Holy Spirit. In fact, however, we may very much be under the influence of rituals and letters. Even our praying, confessing, and seeking the filling of the Spirit can become rituals and not come out from the spirit by our living in the spirit. The genuine living that comes out from the spirit is without ordinances and rituals. If our living comes from the spirit, our prayer, being dealt with, and seeking will not merely be the fulfilling of a spiritual duty according to rituals. Rather, we will pray even more, be dealt with more thoroughly, and be filled to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Perhaps some will say that they are not merely fulfilling duties; they are sincere and true, keeping a time with the Lord every day. This may be true, but their practice may still be a routine practice of keeping the rules sincerely and truly. One may pray, confess his sins, and seek the filling of the Holy Spirit sincerely and truly yet still not touch the spirit even a little. This kind of praying, confessing, and seeking is still very much of the letter. Although the thing done seems very spiritual, the doing of it is still of the letter. This proves that such persons themselves are of the letter. If someone asks you why you pray in this way, you may answer that it is because the Bible teaches us to do this. These words sound good, yet within these good words there is an implication that is not good. This answer indicates that you are merely one who keeps the rules. Thus, you have not prayed in the spirit, and it is not the Spirit that leads you to pray. You are of the ordinances, of the letter, and not of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, we must receive life and spiritual cultivation in a practical way. We need to receive a nurturing in life that we may be persons of the Spirit and not of the letter. If we have no ordinances or rituals, yet we still live a life that is higher than others&rsquo;, this will prove that we are not of the letter but of life and of the Spirit. Only a man can do the work of man. If a monkey is trained to behave like a man, it is still a monkey, and it cannot do the work of man. Our burden is that we all will see that we must follow the Spirit in life and live in the spirit. It is a matter not of outward practices, rituals, and ordinances but of being cultivated to grow in life.</p>
<p>A fruit tree requires cultivation and special care in order to grow well. Those who work in orchards know that if fruit trees are not protected, cultivated, and pruned, they will not bear much fruit, and they may even be damaged. Still, cultivation is only an outward help for the inner life. No matter how much a farmer cultivates his fruit trees, he cannot replace the life of the trees. He can hang artificial fruit on the trees, but that kind of fruit is &ldquo;of the letter,&rdquo; and the trees themselves will be &ldquo;of the letter.&rdquo; Artificial fruit is not the fruit of life that is cultivated, grown, developed, and borne through the life within the trees. We must avoid this principle. If the expression of our life is merely an outward hanging of fruit, it is only a decoration, not the issue of our life within. This kind of fruit will be tested by the environment and by time. After a few months of testing, the artificial fruit will become old, break, and fail one after the other. Eventually we will have nothing; we will be exposed to the uttermost. Therefore, regardless of what situation we are in, whether good or bad, we need to grow in life. Growth develops the nurturing we have obtained and strengthens the content of our inner life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Keeping the Outward Ordinances but Building Up a Character for Serving</h2>
<p>We must also pay attention to our character. It is difficult for us to receive help regarding our character. To keep ordinances is easy, and to pick up new things is also easy, but to properly build up our character is not easy. This is because the building up of character is related to our weightiness in life.</p>
<p>We all have seen children singing hymns, and we are truly touched by them. Yet no matter how much they touch us and even stir us to tears, we still realize that they are children. They can try their best to behave in a certain way, and they can even act like old adults, but no matter how much they perform, they are still children. Their true outward expression depends not on how hard they try to perform but on the normal growth of the life within them. We need to take care of this principle.</p>
<p>What can truly be a help to others is very much related to the weightiness of our life. For a person to be loose in his character is a proof that his spiritual life is immature. When one person weeps or laughs, others can see his immaturity, but when someone else weeps and laughs in the same way, others can see his maturity. A person&rsquo;s expressions and feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight are the manifestations of the actual weight of his life. No one can pretend in this matter. The building up of a person&rsquo;s character is altogether a matter of life.</p>
<p>More than thirty years ago we had a training on thirty traits of character. At that time one hundred twenty persons joined the training. Those who were twenty-five then are now close to sixty. To my impression, however, their character now is not much different from what it was when they were twenty-five. Some of them now have gotten married and had children, and some of their children have already graduated from college. Still, their character has never changed much; they are mostly the same. Originally they were loose, and now they are still loose in the same way. This is a cause of concern to us. I hope that the young people, including the full-time trainees, as they begin to learn how to serve the Lord, will receive the training of their character in a serious and strict way, forsaking all performance and pretense and gaining a genuine weightiness in their inner life.</p><h2 class="head1">TO CONDUCT HOME MEETINGS<br />
REQUIRING A GRAVE CHARACTER</h2>
<p>When we conduct a home meeting, the first impression that people in the home obtain from us is not what message we speak or how we teach them but what kind of person we are. Their first impression is whether we are light persons or weighty persons, whether we are loose or grave. The Bible tells us that as those who serve the Lord, elders and deacons should have the same kind of character, one which is &ldquo;grave&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:2-4, 8). <em>Grave</em> is a very good term, meaning solid, weighty, and not light. Some people may say that young people are simply young, and we cannot expect a twenty year old to be grave. Please remember, though, that gravity depends not on age but on how much weight one has and how much element of life is within him. If what is within you is &ldquo;cotton fluff,&rdquo; you will have no weight, but if what is within you is gold, you will be very weighty.</p>
<p>We can discern from the way a person lives whether he is light and frivolous or grave and proper. A person cannot hide or pretend in this matter. Our inner weight depends on what is within us. If there is much of God as gold within us, we will truly be weighty. If our life is light and flighty, it is because we do not have enough of God within us. Today in the church, there are still some older ones whose behavior gives people a feeling of lightness. Hence, our being grave depends not on our age but on the addition of God as life within us.</p>
<p>We must learn that to go out to work is not to perform or act. Our going out to work is a matter of our living. The spiritual weight within us spontaneously becomes our character. We are ministers of the new covenant, those who are regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed by God, and inwardly filled with God. Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &ldquo;But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; Ultimately, we all will be transformed into His image. According to the usage in the New Testament, <em>image</em> refers not merely to an outward form but to the outward expression of the inner being. The expression of what we are is our image; our image is exactly according to who we are inwardly in our being. Therefore, to be transformed into the image of the Lord does not mean merely to look like Him outwardly. Commonly speaking, we may say that a picture of us is our image, but according to the usage of <em>image</em> in the Bible, a picture alone can never be our image. Our image is not merely our outward appearance; it is the expression of what we are.</p>
<p>Society today teaches people to do things outwardly instead of caring for what they are inwardly. Being a minister, however, is not a matter of doing but of being. It is not our adjusting and adorning ourselves outwardly; it is a matter of our own being. We often hear people say that a certain person gives a good impression. This refers not to that person&rsquo;s simple outward appearance but to the impression he gives to people by his behavior. The impression that a person&rsquo;s inward being conveys to people is his image. Today our going to different places to work is to allow people to see our image, our actual being.</p>
<p>Therefore, we as the ministers of the new covenant must definitely remember that we are not of the letter, ordinances, teachings, or certain methods. Rather, we are of the Spirit and of life in a weighty way. This is what we need to be.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR WORK BEING THE MINISTRY OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:8 speaks about the ministry of the Spirit. <em>Ministers,</em> plural, are the many ministers, while <em>ministry</em> refers to the unique ministry. Whereas <em>ministers</em> refer to people, <em>the ministry</em> refers to the work done by people. We, the ministers, are of the Spirit. Our work, however, is not merely of the Spirit; it <em>is</em> the ministry of the Spirit. There is a difference between being of something and being that thing. To say that something is of gold means that it has some gold in it, but to say that it is gold means that the whole object is gold. A golden necklace, for example, may not merely be of gold, that is, plated with gold; rather, it may be entirely of gold. Today our work is the Spirit. The Bible first tells us that the word is spirit (John 6:63). Then in Ephesians 6:17 Paul states this the other way around, saying that the Spirit is the word of God. Bible translators have had a controversy over this verse, which speaks of the sword of the Spirit. Most people understand that the sword of the Spirit is the word of God; that is, the word is the sword. According to the Greek grammar, however, it is the Spirit, not the sword, that is the word.</p>
<p>We should not merely say that the work we are doing today is a spiritual work. Rather, the work we do today is the Spirit. The Lord Jesus took the lead in the New Testament to say, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit&rdquo; (John 6:63). According to this principle, we can also say that the work which the Lord has given to us is spirit. The work, the ministry, of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit, not merely a spiritual ministry. In Greek, phrases such as <em>ministry of the Spirit</em> comprise words in apposition. Just as <em>the love of God</em> means that God and love are one, and <em>the life of God</em> means that God and life are one, <em>the ministry of the Spirit</em> means that the Spirit and the ministry are one. The work we go out to do is not merely a spiritual work but is also a work that is the Spirit. The Lord said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing.&rdquo; We may also say that doctrine profits nothing; only the Spirit gives life. If the word we speak is spirit, it will give life. Therefore, all the revelations of the New Testament require us to become spirit. When we become those who are filled with the Spirit, the words we speak will be spirit, and the work we do will also be spirit. Our ministry will not only be spiritual but will be spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INCREASE OF CHRIST<br />
AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD BEING<br />
THE INCREASE OF THE ELEMENT OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:27 says, &ldquo;To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; The mystery here is the mystery of God, the mystery hidden in God. This mystery has a glory, which is the glory of the mystery. God has a mystery, and this mystery is one that has glory. Moreover, the glory of this mystery has riches. This mystery that has glory is Christ in us as the hope of glory. Here there is a glory and a hope of glory.</p>
<p>Our being spiritual and our work becoming spirit depend on how much we know the mystery of God. The mystery of God is Christ. Therefore, the extent to which we know and experience Christ as the mystery of God is the extent to which we are spiritual. To say this more simply, if the element of Christ is in us, we are spiritual. When Christ increases in us, the element of the Spirit also increases in us. There is more of the Spirit in us, because Christ is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Our Christian life should be the life portrayed in the Gospels, one of denying the self and taking up the cross to follow the Lord. Many people have the superficial thought that to follow the Lord is simply to walk after Him. This is not the meaning of the Lord&rsquo;s word. Rather, it means that today we need to live a life of denying our self, putting the self aside, and inwardly receiving Christ as life. To receive Christ as life inwardly is the genuine way to follow Jesus. When we were saved, we may have heard that we should forsake everything to follow Jesus. We may have been very touched and willing to follow, but we may not have known how to follow. Then one day we received the light to see that the genuine following of Jesus is to put aside our self, receive the pneumatic Christ inwardly, allow Him to be our life, and let Him increase and grow in us day by day. This is the increase and growth of the Spirit in us. In this way we will one day become not only spiritual but also spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCING THE SUBJECTIVE CHRIST<br />
WHOM WE ENJOY AND EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>Verse 27 says, &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; Then verse 28 says, &ldquo;Whom we announce.&rdquo; We announce Him no longer as an objective One but the One whom we experience subjectively. We are not announcing One whom we have not gained, enjoyed, and experienced. Rather, we are announcing the One whom we have enjoyed. We have experienced and gained Him. He is one with us, and we are one with Him. In other words, we are announcing ourselves, but it is no longer we but Christ in us.</p>
<p>Paul said in Galatians 2:20, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; To be sure, we announce Christ, but now He is no longer only the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended One. Now He is the One who is living in us. We are preaching such a subjective Christ. In Philippians 1:21 Paul said, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; Can we say that to us to live is Christ? Sometimes we dare not say this. If we say this, others may ask, &ldquo;Is Christ the way you are? You lost your temper yesterday, and today you were joking. Is Christ like this?&rdquo; This may give people doubts about the Christ we speak of. Nevertheless, Paul truly declared in the New Testament, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; In this sense, Paul became Christ. In verse 20 Paul said, &ldquo;As always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.&rdquo; Paul magnified Christ not only once but &ldquo;as always.&rdquo; This is the One whom Paul preached. He did not announce an objective Christ. Rather, he preached a subjective Christ, the Christ whom he had enjoyed and who had become him.</p>
<p>Some people may say to us, &ldquo;You have been saved for many years. This is why you can speak such a word. We have been saved for only several months, so we dare not say this.&rdquo; This is a valid excuse, but at least we all can take this as our goal. We need to tell the Lord, &ldquo;O Lord, one day I will tell others that to me, to live is Christ. From now on, to me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; In our daily living we must learn to experience Christ so that day after day He will become a subjective Christ to us. In this way we can boldly, strongly, and fearlessly tell others, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What we are concerned for is not how many people are baptized. Rather, it is whether or not we can say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; Methods cannot subdue people. Instead, it is the true Christ who has become our life lived out from within us. Only this is the power, only this has the authority, and only this can subdue people. We should not go out with a mere saying that &ldquo;to me, to live is Christ&rdquo; without being those in whom Christ can be found. We must realize that what we have learned may still not be real. Whether or not it is real altogether depends on whether or not it is Christ. This is a very serious matter. We do not want to see that, having been led here by the Lord, what we accomplish after many decades is merely a campaign, encouraging people to knock on doors all over the world. Instead, we want to see more of Christ in all of us until we all can say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(A message given on June 2, 1987 in Taipei, Taiwan)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GLORY OF THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:27 says &ldquo;To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; God had a mystery that even the angels did not know. This mystery was hidden in God Himself, until one day He became flesh to accomplish the mystery (Eph. 3:9). Then He called the apostles and prophets and revealed the mystery to them (v. 5). Since this was done in the New Testament age, it is called the New Testament economy. Hence, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to carry out the mystery of God, and this mystery is the content of the New Testament economy. This mystery has its glory, and this glory is rich.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the riches of this glory are expressed especially among the Gentiles. God&rsquo;s economy in the Old Testament was expressed only in the small sphere of the Jews who occupied a small piece of land. However, after God became flesh, lived on the earth, chose the apostles, went to the cross to die, resurrected, ascended, and accomplished this mystery, He sent His apostles to the lands of the Gentiles to bring this mystery to them. The glory of this mystery expressed among the Gentiles is far greater than the glory in the Old Testament and the economy of God expressed among the Jews. Therefore, Paul said, &ldquo;What are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles.&rdquo; <em>What are the riches</em> implies that the riches are indescribable. Since there is no way to speak of or describe them, <em>what are</em> is used as the description.</p>
<p>Today we all enjoy this glory and are in this glory. Nevertheless, Christianity has almost completely lost this glory. In Christianity this glory has been restricted and covered. If you go to visit the Vatican, the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, you can see only material things, not anything that is related to the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy, not to mention the glory of God in the New Testament.</p>
<p>The mystery of God may be compared to the sun, and the glory of this mystery is the sunlight. The sunlight and the sun are one. Just as the glory of God is God expressed, the glory of this mystery is the expression of the mystery itself. When sunlight is obscured by the clouds, the sun itself is hidden, but when sunlight appears, the sun is expressed. The expression of the sun is the glory of the sun, which is the sun itself. In the same way, when God hides Himself, the glory recedes, and when God is expressed, the glory shines, since glory is God Himself. In this New Testament age, what we receive and enjoy is exactly the glory of this mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN YOU, THE HOPE OF GLORY</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:27 tells us what this mystery is. This verse says, &ldquo;What are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ....&rdquo; Christ is the mystery. Then it continues to say, &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; This means that the glory of this mystery is nothing other than the shining of Christ in you. Today the glory of this mystery has become a glory among the Gentiles and even within the Gentiles. Christ Himself has become a glory in you and me. As we have said, Christ is this mystery. He is the &ldquo;sun.&rdquo; When Christ shines in us, He becomes the glory in us. Then this glory in us becomes a hope, which is called the hope of glory. Therefore, Christ, the glory, and the hope are just one. We can compare them to the sun, the sunlight, and the heat of the sun, which are actually one entity. Without the sun, there is no sunlight, and without the shining of the sun, there is no heat. These three are one.</p>
<p>Perhaps some may still not understand what we are saying here. However, we can check with our experience. Before we were saved, we had no hope or glory within us. At that time all we had inwardly was vanity and darkness without any hope or glory. The reason for this can be seen in Ephesians 2, which tells us that we were dead in offenses and sins, without Christ and God, and having no glory or hope (vv. 1, 11-12). In our life in the past there was nothing that made us feel glorious. However, beginning from the day that we believed in the Lord, we felt glorious within. In Matthew 17:1-3 the Lord Jesus was transfigured on the mountain. Peter was there, but he could not comprehend the glory. All he could say was, &ldquo;It is good for us to be here&rdquo; (v. 4). Today we should not merely say that it is good; we have to say that it is glorious. This is because Christ has entered into us, and He is in us as our glory.</p>
 <p>The riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles refers not only to Christ but also to Christ in us becoming the hope of glory. Therefore, when we go door-knocking, we not only bring Christ to people, but we also give them the mystery, the glory, the riches, and the hope in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Only this is the true announcing of Christ.</p>
<p>Although Paul&rsquo;s utterance in Colossians 1:27 is simple, it includes many crucial words, such as <em>mystery, glory, riches, hope,</em> and <em>Christ.</em> These five items are one. The main substance of this verse is these five words, and these five are one. What is hidden in God is the mystery. When it is expressed, it is glory. When it comes to the Gentiles in the New Testament age, it is the riches. When it enters into us, it becomes the hope. The mystery, the glory, the riches, and the hope are all one person, who is Christ. We need not only to see this but also to proclaim this. We proclaim Him, because He is mysterious, glorious, and rich, and He is our hope of glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE URGENT NEED OF THIS MINISTRY&mdash;<br />
TO RECOVER THE REVELATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>America is the top and largest Christian country. There are numerous Christian bookstores that contain tens of thousands of publications. It is a pity, however, that none of these publications convey to us the vision regarding the above five words. They do not have the mystery, the glory, the riches, the hope, and Christ. Hence, the Lord needs a recovery, and this is our burden. In fact, this is a great ministry, a great commission. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not to recover anything else. It is only to recover the glory and the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, among you and me, which is Christ in us as the hope of glory. We need to see this. We do not need only the objective Christ, the Christ in letter that is taught in Christianity. What we need is a living Christ, who enters into us and becomes our glory, hope, and the riches that we enjoy inwardly. These riches and glory are what we announce. Therefore, Paul said that we announce Christ. We are announcing Him as such a One.</p>
<p>For this reason, what the Lord wants to recover is our full release from Christianity. I hope that we can all see this. Whether or not the Lord can come back depends not merely on our going door-knocking but on how much we know Him inwardly, how much glory He has within us, and how much we have enjoyed His riches. These are the key points. He is our glory, our enjoyment, and our riches within, and much more, He is our coming hope, our longing. Our door-knocking is for this purpose, our home meetings are for this, and our teaching of <em>Life Lessons</em> is also for this. No matter what we do, we do it for this. Even if we become angry, our anger must be Christ. There is no need for anything if it is not for begetting Christ.</p>
<p>Today the Lord needs tens of thousands of people to beget Christ. I hope that we are this group of people. When we go door-knocking, we have to go with the feeling that we are going to beget Christ. This is very valuable; it is not a small matter. In the future we need hundreds of persons of this kind going out to knock on doors in Denmark and England. All the more, we need persons of this kind to go to America and knock on the doors of the old Christianity.</p>
<p>Recently I have received many letters telling me that the new way is truly workable. One letter came from Dallas, Texas, saying that an entire family&mdash;the mother, the son, and the daughter-in-law&mdash;are rejoicing because of the benefit reaped from the new way. If there were one thousand new ones who all testified that they are filled with Christ, that they know nothing but Christ, and that Christ is their gentleness or anger, their studying, working, door-knocking, home meeting, speaking, singing, and their everything in every place, the whole earth will truly be filled with hope. We all need to have this vision.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR HEART NEEDING TO BE ENLARGED<br />
IN THE CHURCH<br />
IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE ALL WISDOM</h2>
<p>In Colossians 1:28 Paul continues to say, &ldquo;Whom we announce...in all wisdom.&rdquo; We need to learn to exercise not only one kind of wisdom but &ldquo;all&rdquo; wisdom, which includes various kinds of wisdom. To this end our hearts need to be enlarged. Some young ones who have taken the new way think that the older ones and those who have not taken the new way are out-of-date. This demonstrates a lack of wisdom. In the practice of the new way in the church we do not want oldness, but we also need to exercise all wisdom.</p>
<p>Whether the new ones should meet in the meeting hall or in the community on the Lord&rsquo;s Day requires our exercise of all wisdom. Does the Lord want people to meet only in the meeting hall? Is it wrong to have several bread-breaking meetings in the community? There are two sides to this matter, so it requires us to experience all wisdom. To have all wisdom is to both break bread in the community and join the meetings in the meeting hall.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, Paul gave many messages, wrote many Epistles, and did many works, but he never expected to lead the churches to become as orderly as &ldquo;tofu squares.&rdquo; The churches in the New Testament were all in different conditions. Someone once said that the church in Philippi was the best of all the churches. However, if we carefully consider the church in Philippi, we will not think that it was very good. Paul said, &ldquo;Do all things without murmurings and reasonings&rdquo; (Phil. 2:14). In such a good church as the church in Philippi there were still murmurings and reasonings. Paul exhorted the saints there to stand firm in one spirit, having one soul, and to think the same thing, the one thing (1:27; 2:2; 4:2). This proves that they were not thinking the one thing and were not of one mind, one soul, or one spirit. They had many differences, and many persons were one only with themselves. This church certainly had good points, but there were not a few shortcomings.</p>
<p>We cannot find a perfect and complete church in the Bible. Today as well there is not one complete and perfect church on the earth. The perfect day has not yet come. In Colossians 1:28 Paul says, &ldquo;Admonishing every man and teaching every man...that we may present every man full-grown in Christ.&rdquo; To be full-grown is to grow in life unto perfection. When someone is perfect, he is full-grown. Hence, those who are still on the earth today are not full-grown and are not perfect. Therefore, our hearts must be enlarged. We must announce Christ with multifarious wisdom and in all wisdom.</p>
<p>In our natural understanding, we may think that the churches in the apostles&rsquo; time were wonderful. However, the fact is that every church in the New Testament had its own shortcomings. Neither the church in Jerusalem nor the church in Ephesus was altogether good; both had their shortcomings. My point is that wherever you go, you should not have too many expectations. All those who believe in the Lord are lovely. They are the brothers and sisters in the Lord, so as long as they love the Lord, that is good enough. It does not matter if their prayer meeting is not conducted according to your way. It is sufficient simply that they pray to the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, we all need to have wisdom. The Chinese have a proverb: &ldquo;The inner parts of the ruler are wide enough to sail in,&rdquo; meaning that his capacity is so great that a boat can sail in it. First Kings 4:29 says, &ldquo;And God gave Solomon wisdom and very much understanding and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore.&rdquo; Solomon&rsquo;s heart is described as the seashore that encompasses the whole ocean. Therefore, we can never require that the church life be uniform. We should not mind the way people treat us, and we should not have our own feeling of how to break bread and how to meet. What we care for should only be Christ. We must minister Christ and receive Christ from others.</p>
<p>After saying that he admonished every man and taught every man in all wisdom that he might present every man full-grown in Christ, Paul said, &ldquo;For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power&rdquo; (Col. 1:29). <em>Struggling</em> is a strong word. It is like the struggle of athletes in the Olympic games. Every competition requires struggling. While the athletes struggle in the games, none of them cares for his life. Likewise, when Paul worked on earth, he considered himself as that kind of person, one who did not care for his own life. Paul used the same word to tell us the kind of attitude and spirit he had while he was working on earth. He struggled without caring for anything else.</p>
 <p>Today we need to learn how to conduct ourselves, knock on doors, speak, teach the truth, minister life, and conduct home meetings, but all the more, we need to learn that there is an intrinsic element in all these things. This intrinsic element is our inward knowledge and experience of Christ. Whether we are old or young, we all should have this intrinsic element. I hope that from today onward, we all will have such a clear vision.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL BEING THE EXPERIENCE<br />
OF THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:8 says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&rdquo; Paul said that the Lord gave him grace, and this grace enabled him to struggle and minister Christ to others. This grace was given to him, who was less than the least of all saints. Paul never thought that he was great; rather, he said that he was the smallest one, less than the least. God gave this grace to Paul so that he could announce the unsearchable riches of Christ, the riches he had seen and experienced, as the gospel. Paul&rsquo;s gospel is a high gospel. It includes not only objective riches such as Christ dying for sinners, being crucified, and being our Savior, but also the unsearchable riches of Christ that Paul experienced and that had become his riches within. Paul preached this as the gospel, and today this is the same gospel that we preach.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>Verse 9 then says, &ldquo;And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.&rdquo; <em>Economy</em> can also be rendered <em>arrangement, plan, household law,</em> or <em>household administration.</em> The mystery, which throughout the ages was hidden in God who created all things, is the mystery of the universe. This mystery is so wonderful and mysterious that it is indescribable. This mystery is the unique thing that the infinite and great God carries out in eternity and in time. The greater something is, the more it needs an arrangement, management, administration, and plan.</p>
<p>We all need to know God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Whoever knows God&rsquo;s New Testament economy can enter into it. This economy is an arrangement. If we know this mystery and also see what this mystery is in God&rsquo;s hand, in His mind, and in His wise arrangement, economy, plan, and administration, it will occupy our whole life. Paul said that grace was given to him to do two things: first, to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel, and second, to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things. What a great commission this is!</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO ENLIGHTEN ALL CONCERNING THE MYSTERY<br />
THAT HAS BEEN HIDDEN IN GOD</h2>
<p>We may compare Ephesians 3 to a video played by Paul. A video brings to light things that have not yet been seen. When we watch a video, we not only listen to the sound but we are also enlightened by what we see. <em>To enlighten all</em> does not simply mean to cause all to understand; it is to show people the &ldquo;video&rdquo; of the mystery which throughout the ages has been hidden in God. The showing of the &ldquo;video&rdquo; is an enlightening. We may illustrate this enlightening with a video of a meeting. Those who do not go to a meeting may afterward want to know how it was. If no one can explain the meeting clearly, they simply can show a video of it. Once the video is played, it will enlighten everyone.</p>
<p>I hope that when we go out to speak these things, we will enlighten people with our &ldquo;video.&rdquo; We should not simply speak; we should show people a scene. When we go out, we each should be a small &ldquo;video player,&rdquo; opening our mouth to show a scene to people in the home meetings. This will enlighten them with Christ, the riches of Christ, and Christ as the glory and hope within them. Paul went not only to explain but to enlighten. Paul&rsquo;s utterance&mdash;&ldquo;to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God&rdquo;&mdash;is unique in the whole New Testament.</p>
<p>No matter how we lead the meetings, we have to enlighten people with the mystery that has been hidden in God. Originally this mystery was hidden in God, but now it is not only revealed to us, but it also enlightens us. The showing of this &ldquo;video&rdquo; not only unveils but also enlightens people with everything in it. Whenever we meet, there should be the showing of a &ldquo;video&rdquo; so that we will not only hear something but also see the shining of the light.</p>
<p>Day by day we should have more seeing of this mystery. After seeing the &ldquo;video&rdquo; inwardly, we will be impressed with an image. Then when we go out to speak to people, we will become a &ldquo;video player&rdquo; to enlighten people. I hope that through much prayer and seeking we will allow this to become a real vision, seeing, and practice among us.</p>

<h1 class="title">ENLIGHTENING ALL<br />
CONCERNING THE MYSTERY<br />
WHICH HAS BEEN KEPT IN SILENCE<br />
IN THE TIMES OF THE AGES</h1>
<p>In Ephesians 3:8 Paul says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given.&rdquo; God gave Paul the grace to do two things: first, to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel, and second, to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things (v. 9). This is the commission and charge Paul received through the grace of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL BEING<br />
THE RICHES OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</h2>
<p>The gospel in Ephesians 3 is very different from the kind of gospel we normally hear and preach. This chapter does not say that man is sinful, that the Lord Jesus died for man, and that if we believe in Him, we will have joy and peace. Rather, it says that the gospel is the riches of Christ, the all-inclusive One. This Christ is so all-inclusive that His riches are unsearchable, immeasurable, and untraceable.</p>
<p>The gospel preached by Christianity throughout the years has often made us shallow and dull. This is because the gospel in Christianity always begins from the sinners&rsquo; side, saying that we are sinners who deserve to perish, that all kinds of disasters and sufferings are upon us today because we are sinful, and that we should repent. This is absolutely true, and these things can all be found in the Bible. However, this is a very elementary and shallow gospel. Christianity today knows how to preach only this kind of gospel and nothing beyond it. If people were asked to advance to preach the gospel of life or the gospel of the kingdom, they would be at a loss. On the whole, people mainly know the gospel of the forgiveness of sins, preaching only that man is sinful but that because of God&rsquo;s love Christ died for us to redeem us, and if we believe in Him, we will have peace, joy, and everlasting life.</p>
<p>Christianity has not even clearly explained what everlasting life means. Many believe that everlasting life refers to our going to a heavenly mansion after death to enjoy eternal blessings, although they also cannot explain what blessing is. According to the fleshly view, blessing is the entrance into the New Jerusalem to be on a golden street with pearl gates and a wall of precious stones. Christianity has made everlasting life and the New Jerusalem to be things in the physical realm. It does not have the adequate revelation of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ROMANS SPEAKING OF THE GOSPEL<br />
IN A PROGRESSIVE WAY</h2>
<p>We must be reminded to have a new and deeper view of the gospel. This does not mean that we no longer acknowledge that we are sinners or that we do not acknowledge that the Lord Jesus died for us. We not only acknowledge that the Lord died for us sinners, but we also treasure and appreciate it. The book of Romans speaks of the gospel, beginning from the shallowest aspect, but even this is deeper than the gospel often found in Christianity; many in Christianity have not seen what Romans speaks of. We may say that the gospel in Romans is &ldquo;shallow&rdquo; because it also begins from man&rsquo;s side. Romans 1 points out that man has fallen, sinned, and forsaken God. God created the heavens, the earth, and all things to testify for Himself so that man can know God through His wonderful works. However, man did not approve of holding God in his full knowledge. Instead, he put God aside and worshipped idols. Therefore, man has fallen in sins. This is what the beginning of Romans speaks of (vv. 20-32).</p>
<p>However, as Romans progresses, it climbs a heavenly ladder, ascending step by step. By chapter sixteen it enters into depths like those in Ephesians. Chapter sixteen concludes by saying that the gospel of God is according to the mystery that has been hidden in eternity, that is, the mystery which has been kept in silence in the times of the ages (v. 25). Romans begins from man&rsquo;s sins in chapter one and ascends all the way to speak about the mystery hidden in the times of the ages. If we want to know this mystery, we need to read Ephesians. Ephesians does not begin from man&rsquo;s side but from God&rsquo;s side, from eternity. Therefore, Ephesians 3 says that Paul not only preached the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel but also that he enlightened all concerning the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God, who created all things. This mystery is not only spoken but revealed by enlightenment to all. This mystery is also the mystery in Romans 16.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENLIGHTENING ALL CONCERNING THE MYSTERY WHICH HAS BEEN KEPT IN SILENCE<br />
IN THE TIMES OF THE AGES</h2>
<p>The New Testament speaks of something called a &ldquo;mystery.&rdquo; This mystery first appears in Romans 16 as the mystery of God that has been kept in silence in the times of the ages, which is the totality of the hidden mystery in the New Testament. This mystery was hidden in God from eternity, which has no beginning or end. This mystery that was hidden in God was released to enlighten all in the two Epistles of Ephesians and Colossians. Now we can see that this mystery has two aspects. On the one hand, Christ is the mystery of God, and on the other hand, the church is the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4, 9; Col. 2:2; 4:3). Moreover, 1 Timothy 3:16 also says, &ldquo;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness.&rdquo; Ephesians 5:32 says, &ldquo;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&rdquo; First Corinthians 2:7 also mentions &ldquo;God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the preceding verses regarding the mystery, we see that Christ is the mystery of God. However, this may not seem to be personal to us, because the mystery of God concerns the relationship between Christ and God. On the other hand, the church as the mystery of Christ seems to be more personal to us. Still, this depends on whether or not we are living in the church. If we are not living in the church, this mystery also has very little to do with us practically; the church is the church, and we are we, and there is not much connection between the two. The great mystery of godliness mentioned in 1 Timothy is a primary principle, but how much we are related to it is still in question. The wisdom in a mystery in 1 Corinthians 2 is even more mysterious.</p>
<p>There is yet another verse in the Bible which speaks about the mystery hidden in God. This verse is the most substantial and practical one for us. It is Colossians 1:27, which says, &ldquo;To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; This verse has two versions in the ancient manuscripts. One says &ldquo;in you,&rdquo; while the other says &ldquo;in us.&rdquo; Both <em>in you</em> and <em>in us</em> are correct because Paul spoke in both ways. This shows us that this mystery is both personal and substantial to us.</p><h2 class="head1">THIS MYSTERY BEING HIDDEN AND IMPLIED<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S CREATION</h2>
<p>Christ was originally a mystery in God. Today when He as the mystery comes into us, He becomes a mystery in us. This is very personal to us. It took four thousand years for this mystery of God to be worked into us and become the mystery in us. I am afraid that some of you have never heard this. From the time God created Adam to the incarnation of the Lord Jesus was four thousand years. When God created Adam, He created him according to Christ. For Adam to be created according to the image of God means that he was created according to Christ, because the Bible says that Christ is the image of God (2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15). Therefore, when we say that man was created by God according to His own image, we mean that man was created by God according to Christ. This shows us that in Genesis 1 this mystery was already there.</p>
<p>Some people have been in Christianity for years but may not have heard such a thing. Man being created according to God&rsquo;s image is the literal fact, but its intrinsic meaning is that God&rsquo;s creation of man was according to Christ. God created man in this way because His intention was for man to contain Christ. Man must be according to Christ because one day Christ will enter into him and dwell in him. When Christ dwells in a man, He is comfortable and fits in, because man was created according to Him. We may illustrate this with a rectangular box and a round object. If we put the round object into the box, it will &ldquo;feel uncomfortable.&rdquo; However, if we put in something the same size and shape as the box, it will be very comfortable and fit well. When Adam was created in Genesis 1:26, God spoke forth the intrinsic meaning of His mystery.</p>
<p>From Adam to Abraham was two thousand years, and from Abraham to Christ was another two thousand years. It was after four thousand years that God became flesh. In the beginning God created man according to Christ, but the created man did not know for what purpose he existed. No one knew, including Adam, Moses, and even the angels. Only God Himself knew. This was a mystery hidden in God and kept in silence. When Abraham appeared, God called him and said to him, &ldquo;In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed&rdquo; (Gen. 22:18), but even though Abraham received that promise, he did not know anything about this seed nor did he know who this seed would be.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BECOMING FLESH<br />
BEING THE MYSTERY ENTERING INTO MAN</h2>
<p>This was the case until one day among the seed of Abraham there was a woman named Mary, who gave birth to a wonderful person. On the one hand, this wonderful person, Jesus, was a man, but on the other hand, He was also Jehovah. Therefore, He was Emmanuel, God with man (Matt. 1:23). It was at that time that the mystery in God began to enter into man. Through the journey of four thousand years, from Adam to Abraham and all the way to Christ, God was not idle. Rather, He was very busy. He created the universe with all the things in it, and He created man. Later He operated many things in human history.</p>
<p>Then one day this God with His mystery entered into a woman among mankind and was conceived, and afterward He came out from her womb. This was the man recorded in the four Gospels. He was so wonderful and mysterious that no one could know Him or speak of Him thoroughly. He was both man and God, both Jesus and Jehovah. Moreover, He was also life, light, love, the sun, and the morning star. He was beyond man&rsquo;s description because He was truly a wonderful and rich One. When He was on the earth, people surrounded Him, dwelt with Him, and walked and lived with Him, but no one truly knew Him. The disciples who were with Him for three and a half years observed Him every day. They touched Him, and John even reclined on His bosom. Still, not a single person knew who or what He was. This was because at that time the mystery in God had entered into Him.</p>
<p>Due to the incarnation, the mystery that was originally in the God of the universe was now found in a man in this universe. The mystery in this person was the same as the mystery in God. However, not only do people in the world not know this, but even many in Christianity do not realize it. At the time of the apostle Paul, different philosophies, particularly Greek philosophy, flourished around the Mediterranean Sea. Two thousand years ago the inhabited land on the earth was centered around the Mediterranean Sea. The ancient Babylonian and Egyptian cultures, and especially the Greek culture, had all reached the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, the Jewish culture was also there. These four cultures were mixed together, and the result was a certain philosophy. However, even in this philosophy no one knew that the mystery originally in God had now entered into a person and had become the mystery in man.</p>
<p>After the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, the gospel was preached to people of the nations around the Mediterranean Sea. However, no matter how much people heard it, they still did not understand. Even the Gnostics, who had a high reputation at that time and whose philosophical theories were very mysterious, had no vision of this mystery. Nevertheless, the One in whom the mystery was, was not restrained or put to rest. Rather, He was ready to increase and multiply. He was a grain of wheat that became one hundred grains. Then the one hundred became ten thousand, and the ten thousand went on to become countless grains.</p><h2 class="head1">THIS MYSTERY IN MAN<br />
BECOMING THE HOPE OF GLORY</h2>
<p>This mystery was in God from eternity, and according to this mystery God created man. After four thousand years, many things had happened among mankind, but this mystery was still in God and had not yet entered into man. It was when God Himself was incarnated and entered into man that He became the mystery in man. The first person who had this mystery was Jesus Christ, who was the grain of wheat. The mystery in God became the mystery in the man Jesus. Initially, this mystery was in only one man. Then this man passed through death, and His death planted this grain of wheat into the earth, which then grew and bore much fruit (John 12:24).</p>
<p>As one of the many grains, Peter also passed through death and bore much fruit. By this process of repeated multiplication, the grain of wheat came to East Asia in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and in the twentieth century, we also became part of this increase. The mystery of God was first in Himself, and then two thousand years ago, four thousand years after Adam was created, this mystery entered into man. However, this mystery did not stop there but continued to spread and multiply. After Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, the mystery that entered into that man was reproduced, multiplied, and duplicated. Therefore, this mystery has also become the mystery in you and me. This is what Colossians 1:27 means in saying, &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This hope was originally only in God, and later it became our hope, the hope in the man Jesus. Today when the man Jesus enters into us, He becomes the hope in us. May we not only hear this, but may we also &ldquo;see the video&rdquo; that the mystery in God one day became the mystery in Jesus Christ, who is in us today and has become our hope of glory.</p>
<p>We all added together are the church. Therefore, the mystery in all of us is the mystery in the church. In God there is a mystery, in Christ there is a mystery, in every one of us there is a mystery, and in the whole church there is also a mystery. All these are not many mysteries but one mystery. The mystery in us is in the church, the mystery in the church is in Christ, and the mystery in Christ is in God. This is called the &ldquo;mystery...which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul said that this mystery was hidden in God who created all things. He mentioned the creation because this mystery is an answer to God&rsquo;s creation. The reason for God&rsquo;s creation is this mystery. This mystery is the explanation of God&rsquo;s creation, and even more, this mystery is an answer to all the ages. What was the reason for all the ages? Why was there an Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Solomon, and all the prophets? Why was Israel afterward captured to Babylon, and why was there a recovery? The reason was a mystery. When Saul of Tarsus met the Lord on the way to Damascus, the Lord asked him a little question, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?&rdquo; (Acts 9:4). Paul was captured, and from that day onward the Lord &ldquo;played a video&rdquo; to Paul. Soon afterward Paul also &ldquo;played the video&rdquo; in every place. First he enlightened those around the Mediterranean Sea concerning the mystery that throughout the ages had been hidden in God, who created all things. Then all of us who read the New Testament today have also been enlightened, and now we all see the mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THIS MYSTERY BEING A MATTER OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Today in the twentieth century, many people like to study human life to explore the mystery of human life. Hardly do they realize that Christ in us is the greatest mystery. This mystery is very much related to the Spirit. Today&rsquo;s Christianity reads and expounds the Scriptures, but it does not speak much about the Spirit. The Southern Baptist Church, the denomination with the greatest number of Christians in the United States, discourages its preachers from speaking about the Spirit. Those preachers talk about the Bible, but they consider that since the Spirit is too mysterious, to talk about the Spirit simply leads to trouble. However, the Bible speaks about the Spirit. Particularly in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles the Spirit cannot be ignored in any respect. This is part of Paul&rsquo;s view of the New Testament.</p>
<p>God is a mystery, Christ is a mystery, Christians are a mystery, and the church is a mystery. If in the church we are not mysterious, we are finished and the church is also finished. Without the mystery there is no God, no Christ, no Christians, and no church. Once the mystery is gone, the so-called church becomes a denomination, and we Christians are merely religionists. This mystery is the central reason why we are not religionists. We are not religionists; rather, we are very mysterious. God, Christ, Christians, and the church are not many mysteries but one mystery. This mystery is nothing less than the Spirit. This Spirit is God, and this Spirit is also Christ. Therefore, Christians and the church today are also a matter of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF CHRISTIANS BEING<br />
GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH</h2>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He [God] who was manifested in the flesh&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:16). When we speak Christ to our parents, they may want to know the details of this mystery. The more we try to answer them, though, the more easily we fall into a trap and the more they will not understand. The best way is to not answer. In the beginning, the mystery that was in God was kept in silence, and today it is hard for us to break the silence. Even if we want to answer and declare this mystery, we are unable to do so. Paul said that the riches of Christ are unsearchable (Eph. 3:8). Therefore, they are difficult to clearly speak about and difficult for people to understand. Nevertheless, we ourselves must first be this mystery. When children become Christians, they should become a mystery in their parents&rsquo; eyes. If they are not a mystery, they are finished as Christians.</p>
<p>We should not keep trying to explain the mystery. The more we explain it, the more it becomes unclear. After we have believed in the Lord for a few years, we can gradually try to speak to our parents about it. We cannot explain this mystery, but we can ask them, &ldquo;Are we, your children, the same as we were before?&rdquo; If our parents can say only, &ldquo;You are mostly the same, except a little taller,&rdquo; then we are finished, because as Christians we do not have much mystery. Perhaps after a certain period of time they can say, &ldquo;You are truly different compared to what you were five years ago.&rdquo; We may ask what is different, but even if they try to explain it, they will not be able. Then we can then tell them in a proper way, &ldquo;This is the mystery. You cannot speak about it, and neither can I. Five years ago I did not have the mystery, so you could easily tell what I was. However, after five years there is something in me which you can see but you cannot describe. Neither can I describe it. This is the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When parents hear this, they will take it seriously, because within the past five years they will have seen something in you which they cannot explain and which puzzles them. Your entire living is extraordinary. No one controls you, but you are very well behaved and submissive. No one demands it of you, but you love others. The expression of your living causes others to wonder. Although your living and work may seem no different from that of your classmates, you give people a feeling that you truly are different from others. This does not mean that you are better or more intelligent than others, nor does it mean that you are worse or poorer than others. This difference cannot be described in terms of good and evil. Rather, because it is so difficult to describe, it will cause people to wonder. In actuality, this wondering is due to the mystery.</p>
<p>May we all &ldquo;see this video,&rdquo; realizing that Christians are altogether a mystery that people cannot comprehend. The mystery in God has been duplicated and reproduced in man, that is, in you and me, causing us to become a mystery. If the Christian life we live before others is one that people can see clearly and are able to express in words, there is nothing special about us. Still, to be a mystery does not mean that we hide something from others. Rather, we are completely open, without any secret or hidden thing, but others wonder at everything about us. They dare not say that we are peculiar, but they simply feel that we are puzzling. This is because of the mystery, which cannot be spoken thoroughly or explained clearly.</p>
<p>There is no way to describe the honesty of Christians. This honesty is far beyond, above, and better than all the virtues in the world of men. Likewise, what the Lord Jesus spoke in Matthew 5:44, &ldquo;Love your enemies,&rdquo; is also beyond man&rsquo;s comprehension. This is because people take the way of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. It is only the Lord Jesus who said that we must love our enemies. We cannot understand how someone can listen to this word and love his enemies, but there is such a fact. This is a mystery, and this mystery is God Himself. God, the mystery, came into the midst of mankind, and this mystery has been duplicated many times to enter into us, causing us also to become a mystery. After seeing this vision, Paul enlightened all by &ldquo;playing the video&rdquo; of this mystery. Today we all have seen this vision. Now the more we &ldquo;watch this video,&rdquo; the more we are enlightened and enabled to enlighten others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THIS MYSTERY BEING BEYOND DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>If we have truly seen this vision, it will take longer than our whole life to speak about it. In the United States some people condemn us as being pantheists because we say that God is everything. It is true that our God is everything, but it is false that we are pantheists. To be sure, Jesus is the real orange and apple, and He is the best steak. Christ is everything. He is our food and drink, our eating and drinking. No matter what we drink today, we are not satisfied. Only when we drink Christ are we truly satisfied. When the Lord Jesus was preaching on the earth, He was able to use many items as illustrations of Himself. There was nothing positive that He could not use. This was because He is everything. This is an aspect of the mystery. Our eyes need to be opened to see that the mystery which throughout the ages was hidden in God, who created all things, has been not only manifested but also revealed to us by enlightenment.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover Christ. Christianity today has adulterated God&rsquo;s word to a certain degree, so we must have the discerning ability and the endeavoring to know the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. For the Lord&rsquo;s return, Christ must be strongly recovered in a group of people. Today when we go out to knock on doors and visit people, we are preaching the gospel of this Christ to them. For this reason, we must first be those who are filled with Christ. We need to firmly believe that under the sovereign arrangement of God there are sons of peace. When we go to knock on doors, we should not be afraid of people&rsquo;s opposition, because there will be God&rsquo;s sons of peace. Then after finding them, we have to preach Christ to them faithfully.</p>
<p>On the earth there are always some who are hungry and thirsty and who have been prepared by the Lord. Oppositions have always followed the gospel, so we need not be afraid but bold. When the apostle Paul went out to preach the gospel, particularly when he was among the Jews, his preaching would always issue in two groups of people, those who followed his preaching and those who did not follow but rather became enemies. Today if we cannot produce this kind of condition when we lead people everywhere to follow the Lord, we are not yet a mystery. However, this does not mean that we should go out to cause trouble and stir up chaos. Instead, we Christians are the most peaceful and safest group of people. Nevertheless, the &ldquo;germs&rdquo; of the mystery in us will cause things to happen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENLIGHTENING ALL CONCERNING<br />
THE GLORY OF THIS MYSTERY</h2>
<p>Only those who have seen this are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. In Ephesians 4 Paul spoke of these four kinds of people. He himself was all of these&mdash;an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, and even more a shepherd and teacher. Today even the youngest among us, if they have truly seen this &ldquo;video&rdquo; of the mystery of Christ, also can be apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. This does not come from the study of theology. It is by seeing this heavenly &ldquo;video&rdquo; that one becomes such a person.</p>
<p>If this reality can be constituted in us, it will govern us in our preaching of the gospel, leading of the home meetings, and leading of the new ones to sing and read the word of God. In other words, it will govern our entire living. As a result, the people whom we lead and help will be able to know Christ in a subjective way, not merely in a doctrinal way. Then in a short time they will be brought into the practical experience of the Body of Christ. May we all pay attention to this, pray for this, and also have much fellowship with one another about this.</p>
<p>(A message given on June 10, 1987 in Taipei, Taiwan)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEED FOR TRAINING<br />
AND THE MEANING OF TRAINING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TO SERVE THE LORD<br />
REQUIRING CONTINUAL LEARNING</h2>
<p>People in general consider that to preach is easy, as if anyone can preach simply by speaking. This is a great mistake. Nothing right and proper in the universe is easy, nor can it be accomplished by natural means. Those who have adequate understanding know that nothing is more demanding than serving the Lord, because of the requirements of a high standard, level, and morality. Among the human community, serving the Lord requires the highest standard. However, according to the impression of people in general, serving the Lord is simple. In a certain family, both the parents of three sons had received a high education. They were all Christians, but they had the strange concept that the smartest of the three should study medicine, the one who was not as smart should study business, and the least capable one should study theology. This is a very erroneous concept in people&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>In 1952 and 1953 there was a co-workers&rsquo; training in Taipei. In those days education was not universally available, and the standard of education was not high. Because of this, in that training we accepted many brothers and sisters without a high education. They loved the Lord very much and were willing to consecrate themselves to Him. However, now that over thirty years have passed, experience tells us that the inadequate level of education is a great shortcoming and lack among our co-workers.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have a deep realization that our training must have some requirements. The trainees must have completed a college education or at least graduated from a junior college. This is not only a requirement for the trainees, but it should be the minimum educational requirement for all of us. Even if some have already received a degree, even a doctoral degree, they should not stop learning. Serving the Lord requires continual learning. I always keep dictionaries close by, such as Chinese, English, Greek, and other dictionaries. In my collection of books the largest category is Bible expositions, and the second largest is dictionaries. Under the covering of the Lord&rsquo;s blood, I have to tell you that until this day I have not stopped learning. What is disappointing, saddening, and even shameful, is that not many who received the training here thirty years ago have continued with further learning. Therefore, there is very little manifestation of their function, and their accomplishments are not apparent. The reason for this is that they do not have a spirit of developing new territories, endeavoring to advance, and desiring to learn further. Hence, it is impossible for them to progress.</p>
<p>All of the major American companies employ specialists. Even if the employees have already obtained doctorate degrees, the company will still encourage them to continue learning. If medical doctors do not keep up with further education, they will fall behind after only a few years. Nurses also must take examinations every few years. This is our observation of the world. Therefore, we feel that the educational level of the full-time trainees must be high.</p>
<p>Next, we also encourage those who have already received the training not to consider themselves as already qualified. They must realize that being qualified today does not ensure their qualification tomorrow. We must keep abreast of the times. If we have one day, we need to continue learning for one day, and if we have one year, we need to continue learning for one year. If we stop, we will fall behind immediately. Time and age will eliminate us. We must be warned.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING THE ABILITY TO ADAPT <br />
TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND WORK FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>This has been the situation of the service in Taiwan for the past thirty years. The work of a co-worker who received his training over thirty years ago may be considered acceptable, but if he goes to the United States to work, he may not be able to meet the needs and keep up with the times. Once his environment changes, his situation becomes different. If he brings the way of the work in Taiwan to the United States, it will not work, and it will not be suitable. Adjusting to an environment is not easy. In order to adjust to anything, we need a certain ability, but adjusting to a new environment requires a great ability.</p>
<p>I was born in P&rsquo;englai in Shantung Province. At about nineteen years of age, I moved to Chefoo, a port city with a population of over 200,000. My mother was born into Christianity. She was a third generation in the American Baptist Church and had received some education in Christianity, so her views were rather modern. Even though the family was poor, she endeavored to send me to an English school to receive an education in the modern language. I thank the Lord for this, and I also believe this was the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign preparation. When I went to the United States at sixty years of age, not only were the Chinese surprised, but even the Americans were amazed at how this co-worker could preach in English. They did not know that I had begun to study English books when I was young. My point is that we all must realize that adjusting to a new environment requires equipping.</p>
<p>After I was called and saved by the Lord in 1925, I began to serve Him with my full time in 1933. Brother Watchman Nee had much to do with this. When I was struggling, not clear whether the Lord wanted me to leave my career, Brother Nee wrote me a letter saying that he felt that I should serve the Lord full-time. This had a very deep influence on me. We had not corresponded for a long time, but he wrote to me at that time from overseas, when I needed it the most. I found this very meaningful. The night after I left my job, I went to Shanghai to see him. He kept me there and asked me to take up the responsibility of giving messages in Shanghai. This was fifty-four years ago. At that time, the common people in the Shanghai area did not understand Mandarin; they all spoke their own dialect. Therefore, I did not know how to give messages. To give messages to a group of people who did not understand Mandarin was truly not easy. However, the Lord was merciful to me to enable me to adjust to the environment. I learned that even though the pronunciation was different, people could still understand me if I spoke carefully. This was a matter of learning. It is always good to learn more skills. There is not one skill that is not useful. All skills are useful when the needs arise.</p>
<p>We all need to learn to keep up with the age. I started writing spiritual materials in 1930. The first item I wrote was &ldquo;What Is Regeneration?&rdquo;, which was greatly welcomed. Prior to 1930 there was no literature appropriate for regenerated ones, so I wrote this article according to the best of my understanding. I never thought that it would be so welcomed. The next year the Lord raised up a church in my hometown, Chefoo, where I began to give messages as the mouthpiece of the Word. Until now, over fifty years later, I have never stopped my further study, and I have never stopped learning.</p>
<p>When the Lord raised up the church in Chefoo, I did not know any Greek, but I felt that knowing Greek was very important, and I wanted to learn it. I asked a friend of mine to buy an English-Greek interlinear New Testament in Shanghai. Beginning from December of 1932 I wanted to use the Greek Bible, but I was unable to, never having studied Greek. However, because certain Christians in China had published some books about Greek at that time, I was able to collect them and learn Greek by myself. Gradually, I was able to refer to the Greek Bible. I have given the foregoing testimonies with the hope that all who serve the Lord will continually learn diligently, learn constantly, and learn unceasingly.</p>
<p>The difference between learning and not learning is very great. In ancient China the position of the teacher of the crown prince was a special one. One day a teacher was in the imperial study teaching the prince, and the emperor came to the window to hear how the teacher was teaching and how the prince was learning. Just at that moment, the teacher was strictly reprimanding the prince, urging him to study harder. This did not please the emperor&rsquo;s ears. Unhappy about the reprimand, he said, &ldquo;The prince will be a monarch if he studies, but he will still be a monarch if he does not.&rdquo; This teacher replied, &ldquo;Studying makes an enlightened monarch, but not studying makes a muddled-headed monarch.&rdquo; When the emperor heard this, he was embarrassed and left.</p>
<p>Never consider that anyone can preach with or without learning. The difference between learning and not learning is very great. Apparently, we who work for the Lord can do the work whether or not we are willing to learn and use dictionaries, for example. However, history tells us that studying makes &ldquo;enlightened monarchs,&rdquo; and not studying makes &ldquo;muddled-headed monarchs.&rdquo; If we work without learning, what kind of work are we actually doing? It grieves my heart that even though Taiwan has sent out co-workers to work for the Lord, very few who go abroad have any accomplishments or increase. I began the work in the United States in 1962, over twenty years ago. In these twenty years the Lord has raised up over four hundred churches in North America&mdash;in the United States, Canada, and Mexico&mdash;and in Europe, Africa, Australia, and South America. This is because I am never self-content. Rather, I continue to learn and improve all the time.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING DILIGENT IN LEARNING AND<br />
NOT SLOTHFUL IN DOING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>If we want to work for the Lord, we must learn continually. The Lord&rsquo;s work requires not only one person with a Ph.D. but many, who know astronomy, geography, business, economics, and other subjects, because all these are related to human living. In the Chinese educational system, economics is an all-inclusive subject, but the Lord&rsquo;s work is even more inclusive than economics. Up to this day I still read the newspaper every day. In this way I read about events and people, discovering how successful people work and how they spend their lives. This is for my learning. In addition, we should pay attention to major world events, not for our curiosity but for our learning. From this kind of learning, we can draw lessons and be enlightened in the understanding of matters and people and in the experience of conducting ourselves in life and dealing with others. Even though the people in the news may not have believed in the Lord, they are still the outstanding ones in human society. They are not only successful in work but also wise and virtuous, worthy for us to draw lessons from.</p>
<p>Our learning should be of many aspects. Learning even carpentry and iron-working is useful, if it is possible to do so. For the sake of our literary work, it is especially good to have much learning in languages. Besides our native Chinese language, we must also learn English and Spanish, and if possible, we should know German and French. Even though the process of learning is difficult and troublesome, learning makes our dealings more convenient. When certain American brothers came to Taiwan, they learned a little Chinese, so it is now much easier to converse with them. In the same way, if we cannot communicate in people&rsquo;s native languages when we go overseas, it will be as if we are deaf and dumb. Therefore, we must continue learning.</p>
<p>According to our observation, not only do the older co-workers lack a spirit of learning, but even the young ones do not have a high spirit of learning. Although they are more aggressive, in general their endeavoring is still not adequate. For the most part, all learning must be self-initiated, for example, through reading more literature and using dictionaries. You cannot be carefree, passing over all the unknown words as you read, or else what you do not understand, you will continue to not understand, and what you are not able to do, you will continue to not be able to do. Do not let things go by loosely. If you research what you do not understand and learn to do what you cannot do, you will definitely progress, and what you learn will be substantial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY AS THE CENTRAL ITEM<br />
OF 1 AND 2 TIMOTHY</h2>
<p>Every young person who desires to serve the Lord should memorize 1 and 2 Timothy and diligently study every point mentioned in them. There are no other books in the Bible that instruct us concerning how to serve the Lord as these two do. Someone once asked where in the Bible the word <em>training</em> can be found. In principle, it is in 1 Timothy. Verses 7 and 8 of chapter four say, &ldquo;Exercise yourself unto godliness. For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but godliness is profitable for all things.&rdquo; Exercise is even more strict than training.</p>
<p>The word <em>exercise</em> here is related to the well-known Olympic games. Here Paul was referring to the way athletes in the Olympics exercised their bodies, saying that we Christians also must exercise unto godliness. In 3:16 he told us what godliness is: &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; We must exercise to let God be manifested in the flesh. This is a matter of our entire Christian living. The entire Christian life is God manifested in the flesh, so we must all exercise in this way. If all the young people could set aside a few years to exercise like those who participate in the Olympics, the whole earth will be turned upside down. At first, exercising may seem unbearable, but as we come closer to the goal, we become more proficient. This requires training. This is the way with physical things, and it is more so with spiritual matters.</p>
<p>First Timothy shows us that training is the exercise unto godliness. This exercise first demands that all those who are learning to serve the Lord should not speak different teachings in their service. Do not assume that one who serves the Lord can speak anything he wants to about heaven and earth, east and west, and everything else. It is true that you can speak on many matters, but one thing you cannot speak is a different teaching. There is a standard by which we call a teaching &ldquo;different.&rdquo; In 1:3-4, Paul said to Timothy, &ldquo;Not to teach different things...rather than God&rsquo;s economy.&rdquo; The standard is God&rsquo;s economy. Whatever does not match God&rsquo;s economy is a different teaching.</p>
<p>The most effective booklet to use when we go door-knocking and preach the gospel is <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> This gospel booklet is very effective because it was written altogether according to God&rsquo;s economy. An economy is a plan, an intention. God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s plan, and this plan, this intention, is for the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;to dispense Himself into man step by step to be man&rsquo;s life and be lived out from him in order to gain corporate sons who are constituted to be the Body of Christ, which appears in each locality as the local churches in which we, the members of the Body, serve the Lord. This is the definition of God&rsquo;s economy, and it is the criterion for determining whether or not a certain teaching should be taught. If a teaching matches this criterion, it can be taught, but if it does not match this criterion, it cannot be taught, because a teaching that does not match God&rsquo;s economy is &ldquo;different.&rdquo; Christianity is divided because of different teachings. A different teaching is not necessarily a bad teaching, nor does it have to be an improper or erroneous teaching. On the contrary, a teaching may be correct and good, but it still may be a teaching that differs from God&rsquo;s economy.</p><h2 class="head1">REGARDING THE LEARNING AND TRAINING<br />
OF THE ELDERS IN 1 TIMOTHY</h2>
<p>Paul also said that he was appointed to be a teacher of the Gentiles (2:7). He was a &ldquo;coach&rdquo; to teach men (v. 8), women (vv. 9-15; 3:11), and also the elders and deacons (vv. 1-10, 12-13). If we carefully read the qualifications of an elder, we may feel that only angels can be elders. In all of Christianity, and even among us, many elders are too poorly qualified because they have not been trained. Verse 2 of chapter three says concerning the qualifications of an elder, &ldquo;The overseer then must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, of a sober mind, orderly, hospitable, apt to teach.&rdquo; To be orderly is to be decorous, to fit the situation. The root word for <em>orderly</em> in Greek denotes to decorate something to be not only comely but also practical, to give it beauty in practicality. This means that an elder must be equipped and remade. The way to be remade is by receiving training. To be trained is to be remade to become beautiful, useful, and thus adaptable to any environment. For example, if we buy a piece of cloth but do no work on it, it will not be useful for anything. A curtain is not merely a hanging piece of cloth. In order for a cloth to become a curtain, it must be measured, cut, and sewn to fit the environment of the window.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1935 several co-workers were living together. I was assigned to live in the same room with an older brother. The room at that time was very small, and not every room had its own sink for water, so we had to bring water into the room to wash ourselves. Because the room was small, the headboard of the bed reached almost to the opposite wall, leaving only a narrow path to walk through. As a result I was careful every time I carried in water, being afraid that if I shook the bowl, I would spill water on the brother&rsquo;s bed as I passed by. Sometimes even though I did not shake the bowl, some water still dripped from the bottom. Every time I spilled water on his bed, I would immediately confess. I needed to confess almost every day, and eventually this brother became annoyed.</p>
 <p>One day as he was fellowshipping with another brother, he told him that although confessing is good, it is better not to make a mistake. At this time I also was there, and when I heard this, I wanted to hide in a hole. Nevertheless, I could not avoid using water. When I spilled some on the brother&rsquo;s bed, I made a mistake, and when I made a mistake, I needed to confess. If I confessed, however, it would annoy the brother, but if I did not confess, my conscience would have no peace. This was very difficult for me. Still, the brother&rsquo;s word was meek and full of wisdom: &ldquo;Although confessing is good, it is better not to make a mistake.&rdquo; On the one hand, I was embarrassed, but on the other hand, I tried hard to consider how not to make a mistake. Gradually, I realized that because I was used only to living in my own room, I could not easily adapt to the environment of two people living together. That was the reason that I could not do even something so small. After this consideration, I changed my way. First I wiped the water from the bottom of the bowl, and then I practiced putting less water into it. In addition, I began to walk with my back to the brother&rsquo;s bed, so that even if the water dripped it would fall on the floor. In this way I adapted to the environment. The brother&rsquo;s word&mdash;&ldquo;Although confessing is good, it is better not to make a mistake&rdquo;&mdash;gave me the opportunity to be remade 
so that I could adapt to the new environment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH LIFE BEING A LIFE OF<br />
ALL THE MEMBERS ACCOMMODATING ONE ANOTHER</h2>
<p>Those who attend the training and live at the training center are daily trained to not make mistakes rather than to continually need to confess. Living together is not easy. When you do something small, it affects others, and if you do it again, you need to confess. We may illustrate this with our meals. For the sake of the overseas trainees, the training center arranged to prepare both Chinese and Western food, according to the way the trainees registered. When the mealtimes came, however, some who registered for Chinese food went to take Western food. Eventually, there was Chinese food left over but not enough Western food. Perhaps those trainees thought that they simply wanted a taste of Western food, but this caused them to be unruly and not able to adapt to the environment. They should not be loose in choosing the kind of food to eat. They should neither make a decision without authorization nor freely invite others to come and eat as they like. This is an expression of not adapting to the environment. We must be careful, adapt to the environment, be regulated, and act in order.</p>
<p>One who serves the Lord must be able to adapt to any given situation. In a meeting, for example, five sisters may sit on the same small bench. If one of the sisters feels that the bench is too crowded, she may push her way onto a bench where some brothers are sitting. However, to do this is uncomely. Do not think that this standard is too high. If a person is loose, whoever he may be, he cannot serve the Lord. Not many who serve the Lord are able to accomplish much. According to my observation, the reason for this is that we are persons who are not only created but also fallen and even contaminated.</p>
<p>Man is born in a fallen condition. Then after a person is born, he becomes contaminated at home, in school, and in society. He may not learn many good things at home, in school, or in the human community, but instead he may unconsciously learn many bad things. Then these things become his constitution. Even if they are not sinful, they may still be contaminating. It seems reasonable to push one&rsquo;s way onto a bench where there is more room, but in actuality it is not proper. Today our society is chaotic and full of competition, but in the church life we should be separated and in a proper order.</p>
<p>According to the rules, a bench should seat four people. One day in the meeting, however, a large brother may sit on a bench and not leave enough room for three others. What then should we do? For the brother to sit there takes space away from others, causing them to suffer. Should we assign another seat to him? It is true that he is large, but it is not of his own choosing that he is that way. Perhaps he himself also finds it troublesome. Therefore, we need to be understanding with him. He is our brother, born of the same Father. Our Father is sovereign over everything, and He causes all things to work together for good. Therefore, for the large brother to sit next to us is also for good. This kind of good work is for us to experience the cross. Paul rebuked the brothers in 1 Corinthians 6 for going to court against each other. He said, &ldquo;Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?&rdquo; (v. 7); that is, why not let others take advantage of you? In all these matters, we must receive the sovereign arrangement of the Father and bear the cross.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the large brother needs to realize that he may inconvenience others, particularly in the meetings. He should therefore exercise self-control for his own health&rsquo;s sake and for the sake of others as well. In the meeting he should not sit so as to convenience himself but rather occupy only three-quarters of the space he needs. In addition, he should be willing not to sit between persons but at the end of the bench. This is to adapt to one&rsquo;s environment. If the saints can exercise in this way, there will be no difficulties in the church. Therefore, we all need to be trained and learn to accommodate every kind of situation.</p>
<p>Rooming with someone who snores is another example of our need to adapt. Someone who snores is usually unconscious of it. Even when others are affected and unable to sleep, he can still sleep in peace. Therefore, one who snores should warn others about it without being embarrassed. Since it is God who created him with this characteristic, he should not deny it but admit it humbly and inform others beforehand so that they can make the necessary arrangements. On the other hand, if you room with someone who snores and keeps you from sleeping, you need to accept it in peace. This may be an opportunity for you to watch and pray throughout the night, adapting to the environment by redeeming the time. It may be that you already had the desire to watch and pray in the night but were unable to do it by yourself. Now here is someone to give you a helping hand. You may pray, &ldquo;O Lord, thank You for giving me a snoring brother to help me to watch and pray in the night. Lord, perhaps this is a judgment from You, because I knew that I should fast, watch, and pray, but I never did it. Now You have given me an opportunity to room with this snoring brother. Lord, thank You because You can never be wrong.&rdquo; This is to accommodate to the environment.</p>
<p>When we begin to learn to serve the Lord, it is very necessary to be able to adapt to our environment. We need this in our dealing with our family, our dealing with others, and all the more in our co-working with others. We need it to deal with the elders, the deacons, and all the saints. All these lessons will come when we begin to serve the Lord. Serving the Lord is like being in a family. According to the Lord&rsquo;s ordination, a husband and a wife cannot be divorced, and neither one can abandon his or her own children. However, the experienced ones know that this is not easy. A sister once testified that because going out to knock on doors requires three people to be on a team, she and her husband were once put on the same team with a third saint. Originally, she and her husband could not get along with each other, but because of the coordination in the church life, they now needed to get along. It is true that a husband and wife will not always get along well, but they cannot be separated or divorced; a marriage cannot be dissolved. Our serving the Lord and our relationship with the saints in the church are like the relationship between family members, which cannot be dissolved. If someone wants to be separated, he will separate himself from everyone for the rest of his life, because no one will be able to match him. Therefore, we must train ourselves to accommodate to the environment and to others.</p>
<p>The Bible speaks about honoring parents. The real meaning of honoring is to accommodate our parents. Some children may seem to honor their parents very much, but when the time comes to give the parents their medicine, the children dictate the way to give it to them. This is not the meaning of honoring. If parents are forced to listen to their children&rsquo;s way to eat and do other things, the children are not honoring them. To honor one&rsquo;s parents is to accommodate them. If they want to eat cold food, we should serve them cold food, and if they want to eat slowly, we must let them eat slowly. Whatever request they have, we should accommodate them. This is to honor them. For a family to have peace, it all depends on the adaptability of every member. To be sure, if everyone moves according to his own will, there will be no peace in the family. There is peace only if a wife can accommodate her husband and a husband can accommodate his wife. If both sides are able to accommodate, accommodation will not be a matter of concern. If you accommodate him and he accommodates you, both will be accommodated, and there will be real peace. The church life is a living in which all the members accommodate one another. It is the same with the co-workers who live together.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR THREE PARTS&mdash;SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY&mdash;NEEDING TO BE TRAINED</h2>
<p>First and 2 Timothy speak of our need to be trained in our whole being. Paul says in 1 Timothy 3:14-15, &ldquo;These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly. But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God.&rdquo; This indicates our need for training.</p>
<p>Every man has three parts&mdash;a spirit, a soul, and a body. In order for us to serve the Lord properly, all these parts need to be exercised. Not only does our spirit need to exercise, but our soul and body also need to exercise. First Timothy 4:8 refers to bodily exercise. Then 2 Timothy 1:7 says, &ldquo;For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness.&rdquo; To have this kind of spirit and mind also indicates our exercise. Finally, Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit&rdquo; (4:22). God has given us a strong spirit, and the Lord Jesus is in our spirit, so we need to exercise our spirit. In addition, other passages in 1 and 2 Timothy speak of the exercise related to our sober mind, which is a part of our soul (1 Tim 2:9; 3:2). Hence, we see that 1 and 2 Timothy speak about the exercise of our whole being. All three parts of our being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;need to be trained.</p>
<p>If we are living alone, we have the choice of being loud or quiet, but if we live with others, our going in and out of the room should be soft and not too loud. This requires learning and is also an exercise of the body. In addition, we often speak of the need to be soberminded. The actual meaning of sobermindedness is that our mind is properly balanced and self-controlled. However, very few of us have this kind of mind. That is why it is one of the requirements for being an elder. An elder&rsquo;s mind must be proper, stably balanced, and self-controlled. The exercise of the mind is a very difficult matter. One who does not lose his temper is one whose mind is balanced and self-controlled.</p>
<p>To exercise the mind is to exercise the soul. The cultivation of our nature, which the Chinese speak of, is nothing more than the exercise of the mind. We are fallen and have been permeated with many bad habits. Many of the problems are due to our mind. Therefore, the Bible often speaks of the proper exercise of our mind. Our body needs exercise, our spirit needs exercise, and we need even more training for our soul. If we exercise in this way, I believe that we can be men above all men. Not only can we serve the Lord, but everything we do will be excelling and of a high standard.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to pay attention to the training of our character. We need to exercise and practice in a serious way according to our book <em>Character.</em> This is important not only for our spirit but for our body and our soul also. Our whole spirit, soul, and body need to be trained. Only then can we have a proper character and a long-term service that is of life.</p>
<p>(A message given on February 11, 1987 in Taipei, Taiwan)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE EXERCISE OF ONE WHO<br />
SERVES THE LORD</h1>
<p>First and 2 Timothy speak about the training a person must receive in order to serve God. Although these two books are short, the points that they cover encompass the entire content of God&rsquo;s economy. What Paul said here is entirely not doctrinal but experiential. He used his experience to train his young co-worker.</p>
<p>Based on this, we have extracted twelve items for our exercise, although these books speak of closer to twenty items, including the way to help the older men, perfect the young men, care for the sisters, and treat the elders. All these are also items for our exercise. Among all these items, however, we will list the more important and fundamental matters, such as those concerning the Spirit, life, Christ, and the Bible. Exercise is a matter of the spirit, soul, and body. First Timothy 4:8 tells us that &ldquo;bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life and of that which is to come.&rdquo; Paul does not say that exercising the body is not profitable and that we should not care for it. Rather, he says that there is a difference in the profit of the different kinds of exercise. It is necessary to exercise the body, but it is not as profitable as exercising unto godliness. To exercise unto godliness is to exercise to experience God, enjoy God, and live out God. In other words, it is to exercise to be with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Paul did not speak of God merely in a doctrinal way. Rather, he wanted us to enjoy God, experience God, and live out God in order to be with God. This is entirely not for doctrine but for experience and enjoyment. For this reason, the first item is the exercise of our spirit. Second Timothy 1:7 says, &ldquo;For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness.&rdquo; <em>Power</em> refers to our will, <em>love</em> to our emotion, and <em>sobermindedness</em> to our mind. This indicates that having a strong will, a loving emotion, and a sober mind has very much to do with having a strong spirit.</p>
<p>Man has three parts&mdash;a spirit, a soul, and a body. In our soul is our personality, our person, which also has three parts&mdash;the mind, the emotion, and the will. This is very wonderful. God is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;and man is a tripartite being of spirit, soul, and body. Then in man&rsquo;s soul, his personality, there are also three parts, which should not be divorced from his spirit. The soul, made up of mind, emotion, and will, surrounds the spirit. When the spirit wants to come out, the will of the soul must be strong, and the emotion of the soul must be filled with love. In the same way, for the spirit to pass through the mind of the soul, the mind must be sober.</p>
<p>The word <em>sober</em> has a profound meaning in Greek. It means that the mind has to be not only clear and understanding but also balanced and unbiased, not emphasizing one aspect while neglecting another. Today people in this world are all sick in this way. We may say that almost everyone has a problem with his mental condition. This is because every person&rsquo;s mind is unbalanced. Many people sleep too much, while others work too much to make money. Both are unbalanced. Whether in making money or in sleeping, if a person has no control, there is something wrong with his mental condition. Those who overcare for nice shoes, pay too much attention to fashionable hairstyles, or love ease while hating work are all unbalanced in their mind. If the mind is balanced, everything will be balanced and regulated. We all need to be balanced.</p>
<p>To be sober means not only to be balanced but also to have self-control, being able to control oneself. A balanced person is one who has full control over himself, one who can restrain himself. Today people in the world are all sick. They cannot control themselves. They have gotten off track because their mind is unbalanced, and their spirit is not strong enough to rule and reign over their mind. This is the condition of the present age. The purpose of our training is to bring us back to the right track, the exercise of our spirit, so that our spirit will be strong to rule and reign over our mind. If we want our mind to be balanced, we need to have a strong spirit.</p>
<p>On the one hand, our spirit needs to be strong, and on the other hand, it also needs to have love. Some people love without a standard. They love good things, bad things, right things, and wrong things. They love recklessly without balance. This is because their spirit is not strong enough. If their spirit were strong, it would balance their love. Some people are so strong that they do not have much love. Being strong without having love is not balanced. A Chinese saying tells us, &ldquo;Be both strong and gentle in dealing with others.&rdquo; Gentleness is a matter of love. We must be strong but gentle and loving; then we will be balanced. This balance is in our spirit.</p>
<p>We need to exercise our spirit to let our spirit come out. The way to exercise our spirit is to call, &ldquo;Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; When we do this, we are balanced. Those who like to joke will stop joking, those who talk nonstop will shut their mouths, and those who are not joyful will begin to smile. To call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; is to exercise our spirit. This causes our mind to be balanced.</p>
<p>We often speak of the Lord&rsquo;s presence, but almost the whole of Christianity has neglected the key to the Lord&rsquo;s presence. They have not seen how the Lord can be with us practically. Second Timothy 4:22 tells us where the Lord&rsquo;s presence is. This verse says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; By this we can see that the Lord&rsquo;s presence is in our spirit.</p>
<p>Many theologians and Bible scholars rightly unfold the truth, but they have never seen that the Bible, especially the New Testament, tells us that man has a spirit and that today the Lord is the Spirit in our spirit. Three verses in the New Testament place God&rsquo;s Spirit together with the human spirit. The first is John 3:6, which says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; Here there are two spirits: the first is God&rsquo;s Spirit, and the second is our spirit. Then 4:24 of the same book says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; Fearing that people would not understand this word, the translators of the Chinese Bible added <em>heart</em> before <em>spirit:</em> &ldquo;worship in heart-spirit.&rdquo; This addition makes the word even more difficult to understand. Is this the heart, or is it the spirit? In the same way, earlier translators of the Chinese Bible added <em>soul</em> before <em>spirit.</em> This also caused much confusion. Is it the spirit, or is it the soul? In order for people to have the proper understanding, we must have the proper translation of this verse. The third verse is Romans 8:16, which says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; All these verses show us that God is in our spirit.</p>
<p>Someone may ask why man needs a spirit; is it not enough for him to have a heart? This question has a simple answer. We may use the example of eating a treat. It is the heart that desires to eat something special. However, we cannot see or locate our heart. We cannot receive the treat and eat it with our heart. The heart can only desire; it cannot receive. Our heart desires the snack, but our hand must reach out to receive it, and our mouth must eat it. We must use all three&mdash;the heart, the hand, and the mouth&mdash;in order for the snack to get into us. In the same way, man&rsquo;s heart can only desire and love the Lord, but it cannot receive the Lord. It is man&rsquo;s spirit that receives the Lord. Our heart is a loving organ, while our spirit is a receiving organ.</p>
<p>In Ezekiel 36:26 the Lord said that He would give the children of Israel a new heart and a new spirit. If the heart and the spirit were the same thing, the Lord&rsquo;s word here would not make sense. This passage clearly tells us that God gives us two things: a heart and a spirit. Eventually, the Spirit of God must also enter into us. When the Spirit of God enters into us, He enters into our spirit, not our heart.</p>
<p>We all know that the Lord is with us, but in what way is He with us? I am afraid that many people do not know the answer. Paul told Timothy, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:22). This clearly points out that the Lord is with us, not in our mind or our heart but in our spirit. Again, we may take eating as an example. When food enters into us, it enters not into our mind but into our stomach. Our stomach is the organ that receives food. We all know that the Lord is the bread of life, but many people do not know how to eat this bread and into which part of us this bread enters. The Lord is the bread of life, and the Lord is the Spirit. If the Lord were not the Spirit, how could He enter into us as the bread of life? If He were not the Spirit, He could not abide in our spirit.</p>
<p>The first thing we who serve the Lord need to do is exercise our spirit. Doctrines do not avail; only experience can help people. Therefore, it is very important to have experience in exercising our spirit. Because of the large number of people in the church life, it is difficult to avoid friction, so we may spontaneously give people a long face. Likewise, there are often things that make us happy in the church life, so we may burst into laughter in an unruly manner. Neither of these reactions is from the spirit, and we ourselves are not in the spirit when we do these things. Our outburst of laughter when we are happy is in the soul, and our giving people a long face when we are unhappy is also in the soul. We do not have two souls; we simply have one soul with several faces. When the soul is smiling, do not think that it is the spirit. It is still only the soul. A long, frowning face is one of the appearances of the soul, and a smiling, laughing face is another appearance of the soul. To genuinely exercise the spirit is to neither laugh nor weep if the spirit is not laughing or weeping. In other words, all of our walk and behavior are under the control of the spirit. To exercise the spirit is to let the spirit take control.</p>
<p>By nature, sisters easily shed tears. If you want something from the sisters, the most effective way is not to say much but to shed tears in front of them. Then they will immediately offer their help. The brothers, however, are complicated in their minds, like Judas was. When Mary anointed the Lord Jesus, Judas calculated in his mind, and asked, &ldquo;Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?&rdquo; (John 12:5). This is a picture of the brothers, who have calculating minds. Therefore, when you go to see the brothers, you need to be rational and be able to give a clear account.</p>
<p>The sisters, though, do not care much about accurate accounts. In the family life there are often quarrels because the husband keeps too clear of an account, while the wife&rsquo;s thinking is muddled. The two sides of the account cannot be balanced. However, if the husbands are clever, they will shed a few tears in front of their wives. On the other hand, the wives should exercise their mind to clearly settle their accounts. In this way the husbands and wives will get along better. This is the secret to maintaining a good relationship between husband and wife and having a peaceful life. However, we are now the saved ones. Whether we are husbands or wives, we must exercise our spirit. If the spirit wants to laugh, we laugh, if the spirit wants to weep, we weep, and if the spirit is silent, we do nothing. The key to our daily walk is the spirit. Without the spirit nothing avails, but with the spirit everything works. Therefore, we all must exercise our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>The second item we need to exercise is to call on the name of the Lord. Calling is different from praying. Whereas to pray is to ask or tell something to the Lord, calling is simply to breathe. We may tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, today I will go to Keelung. Please keep me and let there be good weather so that I can arrive smoothly.&rdquo; This is to pray, to tell the Lord what we want. It is different from calling. Calling is to cry out with a loud voice, &ldquo;Lord Jesus! Lord! O Lord, I need to go to Keelung. Lord, You know that I need good weather.&rdquo; This is calling, not praying. The Lord is our breath of life. If we want to take Him in more and more, we need to take a deep breath. If we merely say in a common way, &ldquo;Lord, today I need to go to Keelung. Please let there be good weather so that I can see my friend,&rdquo; we have not breathed very much. However, if we cry out, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord, I need to go to Keelung. Lord, You know this,&rdquo; we will take a deep breath. Medical reports tell us that the best key to good health is to breathe deeply. If you want to be healthy, you need to take deep breaths every day. In the same way, calling on the Lord not only makes our spirit strong but also makes us healthy.</p>
<p>When we lead people to salvation through door-knocking, we help those who have believed and received the Lord to pray. At first the new one may say in a low voice, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I am a sinner and should go to hell, but You love me and saved me.&rdquo; This kind of prayer may give no sense of the spirit and no sense that he has received the Spirit. If we would rather lead him to cry out, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus, I love You,&rdquo; he will pray himself into the spirit. Yes, the first kind of prayer may be able to lead a person to salvation, because the Bible says, &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rdquo; (Rom. 10:13). This verse does not say whether one should call in a loud voice or in a low voice. It simply says that whoever calls shall be saved. According to our observation, however, a person may be saved without a strong experience of salvation. On the other hand, if he calls with us two or three times in a loud voice and says, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I am really a sinner. O Lord, save me,&rdquo; we will have the assurance inwardly that he has received the Spirit and is saved.</p>
<p>When we go door-knocking, we need to exercise our spirit so that when the door is opened to us, the very first word we utter will allow the spirit to come out. This does not mean that we need to cry out loudly, &ldquo;I am from the church in Taipei!&rdquo; This will not work. Rather, we all must have the habit of exercising the spirit so that when we simply talk to people, our spirit comes out.</p>
<p>A proper and simple way to exercise the spirit is by calling on the name of the Lord. Regardless of our age, we all have to exercise to call on the Lord. This may not be easy for the older ones, but it certainly should not be difficult for the young ones. Those who seldom call on the Lord in the meetings often go home judging people, reasoning about who called well, who did not call well, who called wildly, and who called gently. This often happened in our early years when many people felt that sitting properly was more important than calling. However, they did not realize that their sitting properly deadened the meeting. Just as to take a deep breath requires us to stretch our whole body, our spiritual health requires us to breathe deeply by always calling on the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Certain Bible-teaching denominations tell people that once they enter the meeting, they must remain silent enough to hear a pin drop. As a result, those meetings are not able to enliven people. Rather, they kill people. The quietest place in the world is a cemetery. It is very orderly where the dead are buried. However, Christian meetings should not be dead. Rather, they should be filled with joyful singing and praising. Psalm 27:6 says, &ldquo;I will offer in His tent / Sacrifices of shouts of joy.&rdquo; This is the proper way to meet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING</h2>
<p>The third item that we should exercise is prayer. It is when we exercise our spirit and call on the name of the Lord that we can pray properly. When we pray, we must continue to exercise our spirit and exercise to call on the Lord. Someone may say that since he shares a room with others, his crying and shouting will not allow them to rest. Please remember that we can exercise our spirit, call on the Lord, and pray quietly. We can use a voice that others cannot hear, including our wife or roommate. In a voice that only we can hear, we can call and pray softly, &ldquo;Lord! O Lord, I love You. Do remember Your church.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">GODLINESS</h2>
<p>Godliness is God lived out through us. However, we must exercise the above three items before we can live out God. First Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; Godliness is God manifested in the flesh. We are the flesh, and godliness is God manifested and lived out from us. Paul encouraged Timothy to exercise unto godliness more than to exercise his body. Many of us exercise the body more than godliness. In our living, we must exercise unto godliness according to Paul&rsquo;s charge.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LAYING HOLD ON THE ETERNAL LIFE</h2>
<p>The fifth item of exercise is to lay hold on the eternal life. This follows the above four items. Once we exercise to live out God, we will be able to lay hold on the eternal life, which is the life of God, God Himself. If we want to live out God, we must live by the life of God within us. If we live by ourselves, what we live out will definitely not be God, but if we live by the life of God, what we live out will be God. In 1 Timothy 6:12 Paul says, &ldquo;Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold on the eternal life...and have confessed the good confession before many witnesses.&rdquo; This verse mentions two matters, to fight the good fight and to confess the good confession. To fight the good fight is to go against today&rsquo;s situation, to go against the fashion of the age. According to the situation today, both Christians and non-Christians do not live by the eternal life of God, nor do they know what the eternal life is. People in the world think that this refers to everlasting life, the everlasting blessing that they will enjoy when they go to heaven. They do not know that eternal life is a life by which men should live today. The Lord has raised us up in order to bear this witness and fight the good fight of the faith.</p>
<p>When Christ was on the earth, the Pharisees and Sadducees hated Him because He fought the good fight against them. The Lord fought with them by laying hold on the eternal life. What He fought for was the testimony that God was being lived out on earth. Likewise, Christians on the earth today should also live out God by His life. This is our testimony.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING EMPOWERED IN THE GRACE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The sixth item of exercise is to be empowered in the grace of Christ (2 Tim. 2:1). We all know that the grace of Christ is Christ Himself. The expression <em>the grace of Christ</em> is simple, but its meaning is broad and profound. Christ is the embodiment of God, and grace is the Triune God dispensing Himself in His embodiment into us as our enjoyment. This grace is the Triune God Himself. The Triune God, by being embodied in Christ, gives Himself to us as grace. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; According to the grammar of the Greek New Testament, <em>the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ</em> means that Jesus Christ is grace, <em>the love of God</em> means that God is love, and <em>the fellowship of the Holy Spirit</em> means that the Holy Spirit is fellowship. Without the Holy Spirit there is no fellowship, without God there is no love, and without Jesus Christ there is no grace. God is love, Christ is grace, and the two are one. Therefore, to be empowered in the grace of Christ is to be empowered and strengthened by Christ through knowing and experiencing Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING EQUIPPED WITH THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>First we need to exercise our spirit. Then we need to call on the name of the Lord. When we combine these two, we have prayer. Then God is able to live out from within us, and we lay hold on the eternal life and let Christ be our grace. In this way we come to the seventh item of exercise, which is to equip ourselves with the Scriptures. All Scripture is God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16). It is God breathing Himself out. To us the Scriptures are the Word, but in reality they are the breathing out of God, the expression of God Himself. Hence, today when we read the Bible, we must do it in the way of breathing. God breathes out, and we breathe in. Through this breathing out and breathing in we are enlivened.</p>
<p>We do not merely read the word of God, but we read the word of God by means of prayer, that is, we pray-read the word of God. John 3:16 says, &ldquo;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.&rdquo; We should not merely read or memorize this verse. This will only make our mind complicated, and it will not give us life. We need to exercise to turn this verse into prayer: &ldquo;O God, You love the world. O God, You love the world!&rdquo; The more we pray, the more we have the feeling to say, &ldquo;O God, You love me. Thank You that You love me.&rdquo; In this way we are enlivened, and we receive the life in the word. This kind of pray-reading is a breathing in. God&rsquo;s speaking is the breathing out, and our reading His word in the spirit of prayer is a breathing in. By breathing in and breathing out, we receive life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELYING ON THE INDWELLING HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The eighth item of exercise is to rely on the indwelling Holy Spirit. Although 1 and 2 Timothy are simple, they contain the thought of indwelling. Paul charged Timothy to guard the good deposit through the indwelling Holy Spirit (2 Tim. 1:14). In Greek, <em>deposit</em> is like the money in a bank. If we exercise in the first seven items, many good things will be deposited into us. At this time, we should rely on the Holy Spirit who dwells in us to keep this inward deposit securely. We should keep it not merely by the memory in our mind but by the Holy Spirit. Although we have much spiritual deposit within us&mdash;God, the Lord, and the word&mdash;if we do not rely on the indwelling Holy Spirit but walk according to our will, this inward deposit will be nullified. We must live and walk by the indwelling Holy Spirit so that we can guard the deposit in us, which is of God, is spiritual, and is good.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CUTTING STRAIGHT THE WORD OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>The ninth item of exercise is to cut straight the word of the truth (2:15). The word <em>cut</em> in Greek was originally used in carpentry, meaning to saw lumber rightly and straightly. In the same way, when we &ldquo;saw&rdquo; the truth today, we need to cut it rightly and straightly without twisting, slanting, or distortion. Many people&rsquo;s expounding of the truth is a distortion. Their expounding is not straight; it is distorted. As God&rsquo;s workers and those who serve Him, we must cut straight the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING AND SPEAKING THE ECONOMY OF GOD</h2>
<p>The tenth item is to exercise to speak the economy of God. Today many Christians not only do not know how to preach God&rsquo;s economy, but they do not know what God&rsquo;s economy is. Many do not even know that there is such a thing as &ldquo;God&rsquo;s economy&rdquo; in the Bible. The word <em>economy</em> can also be translated as plan, arrangement, or household administration. The Chinese describe a learned and capable person as one who is &ldquo;full of economy in his inner parts,&rdquo; implying that he is full of plans and arrangements.</p>
<p>If a person wants to know God&rsquo;s economy, he must first know the Triune God. This is because God in His economy is triune. He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the entering into us. God being triune is for the purpose of dispensing Himself into us. The Divine Trinity has a divine dispensing, and what He dispenses into us is the Triune God Himself as our life to regenerate us, sanctify us, and transform us so that we may be conformed to the image of His firstborn Son and become God&rsquo;s many sons. The aggregate of the many sons is the Body of Christ, which is the expression of Christ, and the constituents of the Body are the many members, the many saints, who function in the local churches for the expression of the Triune God. This is God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the crucial truth of God&rsquo;s economy has been mostly lost in Christianity. Even the fundamental truth of the gospel is preached in a way that does not attain to the biblical standard. We thank the Lord that we recently were able to print a suitable gospel booklet, <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> The booklet tells us that man was created by God as His vessel, His container, for the purpose of containing God, who enters into man&rsquo;s spirit. Only this kind of gospel truth can match God&rsquo;s economy. We all need to learn to preach in this way. We should not preach by touching a little here and a little there in the sixty-six books of the Bible. In the end this will leave people with an ambiguous impression of the Bible.</p>
<p>Some people, for example, have emphasized the practice of the washing of feet in John 13. They have taught that before partaking of &ldquo;holy communion&rdquo; they should first wash one another&rsquo;s feet. They insist on this practice, and eventually they have became a &ldquo;foot-washing&rdquo; denomination. In the sixty-six books of the Bible, they see only the practice of the washing of feet in John 13. They say it is the way to love one another, and they condemn those who do not practice it. Without the washing of feet, they say, there is no love for one another, and without loving one another we do not appear to be the Lord&rsquo;s disciples and thus are not worthy to partake of the Lord&rsquo;s supper. Such a teaching is the result of not preaching God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>There has been endless debate on baptizing by sprinkling and immersion. Some people have even said that we should follow the footsteps of the Lord Jesus, baptizing only in the Jordan River, since this is where He was baptized. Some have said that since the Jordan is so long, we need to study history to determine which part of the river the Lord stood in for His baptism. This kind of debate is meaningless and is also the result of not speaking God&rsquo;s economy. We must remember not to argue about such things when we contact people. Rather, we should preach God&rsquo;s economy. Only God&rsquo;s economy edifies people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING SANCTIFIED IN OUR ENTIRE BEING</h2>
<p>Having passed through the above ten items of exercise, the final result is that we are sanctified. Sanctification means to become God in life and in nature but not in His Godhead. In earlier years, this truth caused a great stir among Christians in the United States. As the children of God, we are begotten of God. According to nature, dogs give birth to dogs, cats to cats, and tigers to tigers. Even among human beings, people give birth to children of the same color. A person gives birth according to what he is. Since we have been begotten of God, we certainly are &ldquo;gods,&rdquo; that is, the children of God, who are the same as He is. Of course, this does not refer to the divine person of God, the Godhead, as the object of man&rsquo;s worship. We are speaking here of the life and nature of God. It is in life and in nature that we are the same as God. Every child is the same as his father in life and nature, but the child is not the father. Likewise, we are children of God and the same as God, but this does not mean that we have the status and person of the Godhead. God has not only begotten us, but He is also carrying out the work of sanctification in us. Through sanctification He transforms us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING HOW TO CONDUCT OURSELVES<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2>
<p>As a result of all of the above, we know how to conduct ourselves and how to go out of and come into the house of God, which is the church. This means that in the house of God we know how to deal with different kinds of people, fellowship with them, receive their help, and take care of them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>The above are the points that we who learn to serve the Lord should exercise. In conclusion, those who go door-knocking to bring people to salvation and baptism must have the spirit of the Olympic athletes. Before going to the competition, the athletes prepare every day. Then when they are in the games, they are absolutely watchful, and they endeavor to do their very best. If they do not endeavor, they will not win the prize. When we go out, we must have this kind of spirit. Moreover, we must work and speak absolutely according to the way we have been trained. We should work and speak only according to the extent that we have been taught. In this way our service will definitely be effective.</p>
<p>(A message given on February 17, 1987 in Taipei, Taiwan)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP ON STAYING IN TAIPEI OR RETURNING TO THE RESPECTIVE LOCALITIES</h1>
<p>In August of 1986 we held the first term of the full-time training in Taipei. Now this training is continuing. The main purpose of the training is to perfect the trainees to take the new way, to bring sinners to the Lord that they may repent and be saved, and to continue to take care of them. At this time there are about eight thousand five hundred new ones under our care, and we have meetings in their homes.</p>
<p>Despite the desire of the saints in the various localities, they do not have the capacity to fully take the responsibility of caring for the home meetings. Moreover, these new ones were baptized by the trainees in the full-time training. They were begotten by the trainees and are the fruit of the trainees. If they are handed over to the local saints, I am afraid that some of them will be lost. Therefore, after much consideration, we feel that the trainees should continue to bear this burden.</p>
<p>We need five hundred who have passed through the training to continue to take care of the newly baptized ones in the home meetings. The number of saints in Taiwan who have been trained and can coordinate and continue to bear the burden at this time is only about four hundred. Compared with our expectation of five hundred, we are still one hundred short. Therefore, we need one hundred English-speaking trainees from other countries to remain in Taiwan for at least two years to continue to take care of the home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING THOROUGH AND JOYFUL FELLOWSHIP<br />
WITH THE RESPECTIVE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>There is an urgent need here which requires the coordination of the churches. We have over two hundred fifty English-speaking saints who have been trained. Two-thirds of these, one hundred seventy, are willing to remain. This is very good for the need here. However, all these saints from overseas were sent by the churches in their localities and are supported by their respective localities. Undoubtedly, the local churches sent and support them with the purpose that after they are trained, they will return to their localities to serve. If they are kept here after the training, I am afraid that the churches will think that we have snatched them away. If this is the case, we do not want them to stay; we would rather that they return to their localities.</p>
<p>Whether you are full-timers from Taiwan or from overseas, if you decide to remain and continue to serve in coordination, you must receive a joyful amen from your respective localities. Otherwise, we will not ask any one of you to remain here. All of you are sent by the various churches, and these churches have been supporting you, so you must have not only their consent but their joyful consent if you want to stay here. Only in this way will we have the ground to keep you, and only this is the proper way.</p>
<p>We must always maintain a pleasant relationship with the churches. We are not dealing with the churches in a legal way, merely aiming at obtaining their consent. In spiritual matters, especially in the Body of Christ, a mere legal amen is not what we want. What we want to receive is a joyful amen. Even if you are from other churches within Taiwan, you also must be certain that the churches that sent you here would like you to remain in Taipei and participate in the move of the gospelization in the communities. We want to hear joyful amens. Please bring this matter to the Lord in prayer and have a thorough and joyful fellowship with your respective localities concerning the matter of staying or returning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIVING YOURSELVES TO LEARN<br />
THE CHINESE LANGUAGE</h2>
<p>It will be good for those who remain to coordinate with the work in the communities to stay for two years in order to adequately meet the need. We are joyful that the saints speaking foreign languages can join this work, but we will ask you to learn Chinese. You need to seriously learn Chinese during the day and attend home meetings in the evenings. Otherwise, if you still need translation while contacting people, you will not be capable of taking care of the home meetings. The most capable ones in taking care of the home meetings are the bilingual ones. Their ability to speak both Chinese and English in the gospel work is appreciated very much by all the gospel friends. If you speak only English but not Chinese, they may still welcome you, but it will not be as good. When the gospel friends see you and realize that even as Americans you can speak Chinese, you will win over their hearts. Therefore, you have to pray much and give yourselves to learn the language.</p>
 <p>If the respective localities of the full-time serving ones from overseas joyfully consent to their remaining, we will be very pleased. At the same time, we will assure the churches in the United States that when we send the American saints back, we will send back both &ldquo;capital and interest.&rdquo; By &ldquo;interest&rdquo; we mean that we will send many Chinese saints to help the overseas churches. This is a sweet fellowship. We will borrow the saints from overseas to help gospelize Taiwan. When this draws to an end, we will not only return the overseas saints but also send more saints with them. We hope that all the churches will hear this news and say amen with joy.</p>
<p>Two and a half years ago we planned to gospelize Taiwan by preaching the gospel in towns and villages, but afterward we realized that people in the big cities are highly educated, and the population of the communities in the cities is highly concentrated. Therefore, we decided to begin from the communities in the cities. Taipei is the first among the big cities, so in order to gospelize Taiwan we first need to gain Taipei, and afterward Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Tainan. This is our strategy. All those who will remain and continue to coordinate will live in different communities. There are at least four hundred newly saved ones in each community, so there is much work to do. We will fellowship about the details at a later time.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: For those of us who want to stay, should we fellowship with our respective localities by phone or mail, or should we return to our localities to fellowship with them?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Any method is fine. To save time and obtain a quicker answer, it is better to fellowship by phone.</p>
<p><em>Question: Will this work require a maximum of one hundred saints to stay, or will it require more?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Only the Lord knows what the maximum should be. We hope that all of you can stay. However, you must first gain a joyful amen from your respective localities, and if you will remain here, you must learn Chinese diligently. We will give you examinations, and if you fail, we will have to send you back. The principle here is that when we do something, we need to do it seriously without dragging our feet. Therefore, if you will remain, you need to be clear and prepared to receive the burden to learn Chinese. In at most six months you must be able to speak fluently.</p>
<p><em>Question: If I stay here, when will I begin to learn Chinese?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Many universities here have good courses for foreigners to learn Chinese. We will inquire about them at the schools. If you have any matter to care for that requires you first to go back, then go back and take care of it. If you do not need to return, then remain and join the work of taking care of the home meetings. We will give all of you a vacation of ten days to two weeks. For those of you who have matters to take care of, you may go back during this vacation. For those who will not return but will remain, you may take a vacation and get some rest. After you come back from your vacation, however, you should be prepared to labor. First, you will go to take care of the home meetings. Each of you will take care of seven homes a week. At the same time you will continue to beget, that is to produce new ones by door-knocking.</p>
<p><em>Question: Do those saints who support themselves still need to fellowship with their localities?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We are not doing a business. As long as you come from a certain locality, even though you are not supported by the church, you still need to obtain a joyful amen from the church because that is where you came from. Do not be concerned only with money, thinking that you need to fellowship with the church only because the church is supporting you. It is not like this, and it should not be like this. For those of you who support yourselves, you still need to obtain a joyful amen from the church in your locality.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should the saints from Australia be considered in the same way as the American saints?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is better for all the saints from Australia to return and serve there because the number of churches and saints there is few. To remain here will weaken the churches in Australia and New Zealand. Therefore, apart from special circumstances, we hope that you all will go back to strengthen the Lord&rsquo;s move in Australia in the churches there. We will not do anything to weaken the Lord&rsquo;s work that has been newly raised up in these places. Australia is not like America. Even if we borrow two hundred saints from America, it will not weaken the churches there. On the contrary, it will cause them to be burning. According to what we have heard, the Lord has His move in Australia and New Zealand. Therefore, it is better for you to return to strengthen the churches there. As for those from Europe, it is also better for you to return to strengthen and help the churches for the Lord&rsquo;s move there.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should those who are from the United States be grouped with saints from other churches as a team? If they do this, how should the churches share the burden of support?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The saints from the United States will be gathered together to form groups of four to five. From the beginning of our consideration of the full-time service, we clearly stated that when a church produces a full-timer, it will support him no matter where he goes. Perhaps some will say then that it is better not to produce full-timers, because once they are produced, they will leave the churches in their localities. We need to ask the Lord to enlarge us. What we are fellowshipping here is only a principle. In practice there will be many different situations. If a full-timer produced by the church in New York goes to serve in coordination in Brazil, the Lord in His sovereignty will care for his needs in Brazil. Then he can tell the church in New York that he no longer needs their support because the Lord has already taken care of it.</p>
<p><em>Question: I come from England where there are not many like me. Some full-timers have not attended the training here in Taipei, while some go back to their careers after the training. In this kind of situation, what should I do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The Lord admitted to the evil and slothful slave that He was a hard man, reaping where He did not sow and gathering where He did not winnow (Matt. 25:26). We should never think that serving the Lord is an easy matter. Most of the saints choose to serve in Taipei because it is easy to serve here. However, if the Lord sends us to a place where He did not sow and still asks us to reap, we will need to act accordingly. This is difficult. Therefore, do not choose an easy way. When you return to England, you must be prepared to suffer and to labor. The Lord may give you fields full of rocks, and you will need to sow, fast, and pray. We believe that by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace He as the faithful One will give you the harvest.</p>
<p>When Brother Hudson Taylor first came to China, it was absolutely not an easy situation. When the pioneers of the Presbyterian Church went to the villages in China, it also was not easy for them. When they went door-knocking in the villages, the villagers had already agreed among themselves that they would not open their doors to them. When one or two missionaries came, the first ones to see the missionaries outside the village would immediately strike the gong and spread the news to the whole village, and then all the doors would shut. According to a true story, an American brother from the Presbyterian Church was very wise; he was as prudent as a serpent. He stood outside the door for fifteen minutes to half an hour until the people inside would crack open the door. When this brother saw the opening, he would thrust in his walking stick so that the people inside were not able to close the door. Then after gaining a little opening, he would put one foot inside. Eventually he managed to put both his feet inside the house.</p>
<p>The missionaries knew that the Chinese are kind and loving in nature and are not barbarous, so they dared to go inside the house. They had studied the Chinese living style and found out that every house had a mill for grinding grain. Rich people used donkeys to do the grinding. They would cover the donkeys&rsquo; eyes and then put them to the task of grinding. Poor people, however, had to do it by themselves, which was a laborious job. The missionaries studied and learned about this, so when they entered the house, they would run to the mill and begin to grind diligently. The host of the house would say, &ldquo;We might as well let these foreign devils help us to grind at the mill.&rdquo; The missionaries would keep on grinding. After they had worked for several hours or half a day, the host would give them water to drink. Once the host gave them water, they knew that they were welcome. Then they would continue grinding for the rest of the day. Later they would be given something to eat. This also was a good sign. Eventually they had the opportunity to talk to the members of the family. They knew that the best way was not to talk to them right away but to grind at the mill until the host came to talk to them and ask them where they were from. They then began to speak the words that they had prepared. It was in this way that the missionaries opened the door of the gospel in the villages in China so that we too had the opportunity to hear it. We absolutely believe that when the Lord returns, they all will be rewarded. They were truly faithful. Therefore, do not choose an easy work but a difficult one and receive a genuine burden from the Lord.</p>
<p><em>Question: I come from Canada, but according to my burden for Europe I want to go to Austria. Should I follow my burden to go to Austria?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Since you are so burdened for Austria, we feel that you should go there, but you need to obtain a joyful amen from the churches in Canada. We received a letter from the brothers in Bolzano, a city in northern Italy. They began to meet last year. They learned about the Lord&rsquo;s recovery through our publications and videos. They also began to knock on doors, which has enabled them to bring in a number of new ones and contact some Austrians. Undoubtedly, some churches will be raised up in Austria. If you have the burden, it is best for you to go there to strengthen the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p><em>Question: If there is a need in our respective local churches, but we have been trained for only one term, should we return immediately or should we continue to attend the second term of training?</em></p>
<p>Answer: According to the principle, it is better to complete the second term of training. Attending only one term of training is not enough. You may think that if you remain here, the churches in your localities will suffer loss, but you need to pay a price. It is only a momentary loss. If you remain here for a year to go through the second term of training, your function will be even greater when you return. As you all know, we have a burden to gospelize Taiwan. Because we need you, it is worthwhile for you to remain for the training.</p>
<p><em>Question: Do you have any advice for the trainees from the Philippines?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The principle is the same for them. If some of you have the burden to remain, it will not be a loss to the churches there. To remain for too long, however, will be a loss. For only five or ten to stay may not weaken the churches there. However, this also requires fellowship with the local churches. I do not have the position to say anything. Unless you have the burden and the consent from the churches in the Philippines, we will regard that it is better for you to go back.</p>
<p>We must be clear that we are in the Body and that we come from a certain &ldquo;part&rdquo; of the Body. Whatever we do, we must gain their consent. Life is not a judicial matter but an organic one. Our living in the Body of Christ is entirely an organic matter. What we do should make us grow, not kill us. If our doing a certain thing kills us, we should not do it. It is not a judicial matter.</p>
<p><em>Question: I have already obtained a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and have the opportunity to go to graduate school. Should I first return, obtain a higher degree, and then come back to serve full-time?</em></p>
<p>Answer: That is fine. If you have the burden, you can first obtain a higher degree. Then if the Lord leads you to serve full-time, you will serve full-time. There is no legal obligation. It is altogether a matter of life, an organic matter. We all have to be clear that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we follow the revelation of the Bible and the patterns in the Bible. Among us there is no human organization nor legal obligation. We simply follow the way of the Spirit, the organic way. This is the way of life.</p>
<p><em>Question: If I have not yet finished my college education, should I first attend two terms of the training?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is better for you to first finish your college education. To do the Lord&rsquo;s work in the world today requires education. You need to know more languages, the more the better. I encourage you to learn two languages in addition to your mother tongue. English is a necessity; the other language may be German or Spanish, or another language such as Greek and Hebrew. The more you learn and the more education you receive, the better it will be.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE MINISTRY</h2>
<p>We wish to take this opportunity to explain a crucial matter, that of knowing the ministry. I hope we all are clear that we do not and will not take the way of organization. What we have is not an organization. We have one leading and one ministry among us because all the churches on the earth are for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This ministry is not the personal work of any individual. In every age and generation the Lord has His move, and in a particular age He has a particular move. At the time of Noah, the goal of the Lord&rsquo;s move was to build the ark, and in order to obtain the ark the Lord commissioned Noah to carry out this ministry. We can say that this was Noah&rsquo;s ministry, but Noah did not build the ark by himself. Rather, there were others who participated in the building. They all had a part in the same ministry. For any of them to suggest that they build a tower or a different ark would have been to raise up a different ministry. Christianity today is divided because there are too many ministries. When we say that we are one with the ministry, we are not saying that we are one with a certain person. Rather, we are one with the Lord&rsquo;s ministry today.</p>
<p>In the age of Noah the Lord&rsquo;s ministry was to build the ark. In the age of Moses His ministry was to build the tabernacle with all its utensils, especially the Ark of the Covenant. In the age of David and Solomon the Lord&rsquo;s ministry was to build the temple. In the New Testament the Lord&rsquo;s ministry is to build up the Body of Christ and produce the local churches. This ministry was first with Peter and his co-workers, and later it continued, spread to the Gentile world, and was carried out through Paul and his co-workers.</p>
<p>There should be only one ministry on the earth. Otherwise, there will be division, which damages the Lord&rsquo;s intention and purpose. When we say that we are under one leading, what we mean is that we are under the leading of the New Testament ministry. We believe that in the age of Noah there was only one leading to build the ark, in the age of Moses there was also one leading to build the tabernacle and its utensils, and in the age of Solomon there was also only one leading to build the temple. However, there are too many leadings in Christianity today to build too many different things. Hence, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we must forsake all these things. It would be terrible today for a so-called co-worker to say that he has a different burden.</p>
<p>When we say that we need to receive the one leading, it does not mean that we receive the leading of a certain person but that we receive the leading of the Lord&rsquo;s move. We must not transgress the mark of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry of building up the local churches. We do not have an organization; we only have the work in life. In every age there is the ministry of that age. Moreover, there is the ministry now, and there will also be the ministry in the future. This unique ministry is for the Lord to gain what He is after in a particular age. Whatever we do, and whatever we will do, must be under the leading of the ministry. This will cause us to learn to look to the Lord for His vision and also learn to contact the Lord more, deny ourselves, deny our opinions and views, and live in the Lord&rsquo;s present move. This is not according to our choosing or preference but is altogether based on the Lord&rsquo;s vision and our knowledge of this vision. In this way we are one with the ministry and are under the one leading.</p>
<p>Some people may say that we have this teaching because we want to control everything.

We look to the Lord for His leading in all that we have fellowshipped.</p>
