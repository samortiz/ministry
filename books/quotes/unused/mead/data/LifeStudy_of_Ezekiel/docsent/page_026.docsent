   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE SEVEN THE COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES 1 Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1:11b-14; Rom 12:4-5</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ezekiel 1:11b-14 reveals a very clear picture of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No other verses in the Bible present the matter of coordination in such a definite and practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we will begin to consider the coordination of the four living creatures described in this portion of Ezekiel 1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>COORDINATION IN THE DIVINE POWER,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>STRENGTH, AND SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ezekiel 1:11b says, Two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see that two of their wings are for moving, and this moving is in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By two of their wings they are joined to one another, and in this way they are coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we have seen, the living creatures use the other two wings to cover themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have also seen that in the Old Testament the eagle s wings signify the divine power, the divine strength, and the divine supply.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that the coordination of the living creatures is not in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In themselves they do not have the ability to be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Their coordination is in the divine power, in the divine strength, and in the divine supply because the eagle s wings are the means for them to be coordinated with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, their coordination does not depend on themselves; it does not depend on what they are or on what they can do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their coordination depends on the eagle s wings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The eagle s wings are the means by which they are coordinated and move as one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God Himself is the power and strength, and it is by this divine power and strength that they are coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The same principle can be seen in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The tabernacle was built of forty-eight boards coordinated into one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These boards were coordinated into one building not by themselves but by the overlaying gold Exo 26:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the boards were overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Upon the overlaying gold were the golden rings, and through the golden rings were golden bars.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The gold, therefore, coordinated all forty-eight boards into one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The overlaying gold signifies the divine nature and indicates that God Himself is the coordinating factor that enables all the parts of the divine building to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In themselves the living creatures are separate and are individuals, but with the eagle s wings they are coordinated as one body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that the coordination among us Christians is not something of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What we have in ourselves does not coordinate it divides.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whatever we are in ourselves, whatever we have in ourselves, and whatever we do in ourselves result not in coordination but in division and separation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, we have the eagle s wings, and with the eagle s wings we can be one and we can be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>FOR THE LORD S EXPRESSION, MOVE,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>AND ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is important for us to realize why we need to be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must be coordinated as living creatures in order that Christ may be expressed and manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Also, the coordination of the living creatures is for the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord moves in the center of the coordination of the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, coordination is the divine administration, the divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The throne upon which the Lord is, the throne which is for God s administration, is in the center of this coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, the coordination of the living creatures is for the Lord s expression and manifestation, for the Lord s move, and for the divine government.</S>
