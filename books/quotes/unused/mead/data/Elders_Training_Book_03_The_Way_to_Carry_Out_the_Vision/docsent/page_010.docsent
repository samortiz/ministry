   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR NOT TEACHING DIFFERENTLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We worship You for Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we treasure You in Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, we thank You for this gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We believe it is sovereignly of Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is all a mercy that we are here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank You that we are under Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We enjoy Your rich anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank You, Lord that You have opened up Your Word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are looking to You for this message.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Be with us in Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, grant us to see a clear vision and have a clear way to carry out Your vision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Give us the way, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Give us the wisdom how to handle the vision of Your New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, do cover us again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We hate Your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We hate that he is still troubling us in our mentality, in our concept, and in our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, we are still so natural in our soul without much transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Have mercy upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What we need is Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE PROBLEM OF MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus far, I believe we have all been deeply impressed with the need of a vision of God s New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This training is a training on the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Throughout the twenty centuries of church history, the divisions, confusions, and problems which have taken place among all the Christians were all due to a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever you minister produces something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you minister the heavens, something heavenly will be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you minister earthly things, surely the issue, the coming out, will be earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The many divisions and confusions among the Christians today all come from one source a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Presbyterian denomination or division came out of the ministry of the presbytery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Baptist division came out of the ministry of baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the different kinds of Christian groups come out of different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A ministry is mainly a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must realize that the teaching which a Christian teaches ministers something.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It may minister something right, something wrong, something high, or something low.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A teaching always issues in something.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Based upon the issue of your teaching, your teaching may be considered as a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ministry in the biblical usage means to serve people with something, just as a waiter in a restaurant serves people with the courses of food.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To serve others with something is to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To minister is not to preach, teach, or speak without serving anyone with anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may say that a certain minister who speaks for an hour ministers nothing to people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that according to Christ he ministered nothing, but according to the facts that minister did minister something.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He ministered something wrong, something bad, or something low to people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope we can see that ministry produces problems, ministry produces division, and ministry produces confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>NOT TO TEACH DIFFERENTLY</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why Paul wrote 1 Timothy in the midst of a confusing environment and after many years of his work with his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This Epistle is altogether an inoculation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Poison after poison was injected into the Christian church while the church was going on.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the conclusion of his writing ministry, Paul wrote 1 Timothy to inoculate the church against all these poisons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the opening word of this Epistle, however, Paul did not write in a way that we would think to be so serious: Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This phrase not to teach differently seems so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you merely read this phrase, you will not sense the seriousness of different teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may not think that this is serious, but actually it is more than serious.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It kills people to teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To teach differently tears down God s building and annuls God s entire economy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all must realize that even a small amount of teaching in a different way destroys the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is a proverb which says, One sentence can build up the nation and one sentence can destroy the entire nation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You do not need to give an entire message.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Just by speaking one sentence which conveys your kind of concept tears down everything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must realize that ministry is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Your speaking can build up or destroy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is possible that your speaking destroys, kills, and annuls.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>THE UNIQUE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As we have seen, Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 1:3 that he left him there in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What then, we may ask, is the unique thing which all the Christian teachers should teach?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christian teachers today teach many things such as the presbytery, baptism by immersion, the episcopalian way, holiness, how to preach the gospel, and the way to teach the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We would all agree that to teach the way of Judaism is surely wrong, but what about teaching how to preach the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What is wrong with preaching the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must realize that even the teaching to preach the gospel creates division.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is only one ministry which always builds up, edifies, and perfects with no destruction at all.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There is only one unique ministry that is justified, promoted, uplifted, and even glorified in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In 1 Timothy 1:4 Paul went on to tell Timothy what those ones who were teaching differently should be occupied with God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Through my contact with some of you brothers, I became burdened and made a quick decision to call this gathering for this training.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I do not like to see the recovery destroyed by different teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I realize the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Lord covers me.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You may not know what I am talking about because you do not know all the factors.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>My contact with some of you impressed me with a terrible factor.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I realized that you were going to teach things differently to cause trouble and to create division.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There is only one ministry that ever builds up and that never destroys this is God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must ask ourselves what was wrong with teaching Judaism at the Apostle s time.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is not Buddhism or Gnosticism.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To teach Judaism is to teach according to the holy Word in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Someone could have said to the Apostle Paul, What is wrong with teaching the law?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I am teaching the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Is there anything wrong with teaching people the Bible, with teaching people theology, or with teaching people how to preach the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>There is nothing wrong, but we must realize that this kind of teaching creates division.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In 1 Timothy Paul did not indicate that those who taught differently taught heresies or heathen things.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If they had taught heathen things, no Christian would have taken them.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The reason why their teachings were received is because they were scriptural things from the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>By that time the New Testament had not yet come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The holy Word was only the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>These ones who taught differently could have thought, If you don t allow me to teach the Old Testament, then what am I going to teach?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I am quite legitimate and quite scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Their teaching, however, created division.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Is there anything wrong with setting up a mission and sending missionaries to the field?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We must realize that this is not a matter of being wrong or right, but it is a matter of cutting Christ s Body into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>On the one hand, the bringing of people to Christ through the missionaries is very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Unconsciously, however, this kind of work cuts Christ s Body into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We should be careful because we may do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We may insist, stress, and emphasize a scriptural item which seemingly is right, yet actually it cuts the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It divides the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I called such a gathering because I read people s hearts from their attitude and from their spirit in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I am afraid that some different teachings might be on the verge of coming out.</S>
