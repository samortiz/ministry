   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: What do we need to take care of in our prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Answer: There are many things that we have to take care of in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let me list them below:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 We must sustain a proper fellowship with the Lord in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must bring everything in our daily life to the Lord because nothing in the Christian life is common or inconsequential.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should have a daily and spontaneous habit of fellowshipping with the Lord in everything Phil 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2 We should petition again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord loves to see men petitioning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is a gracious Giver, and He wants man to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"But if any one of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and does not reproach, and it will be given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing" James 1:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"You do not have because you do not ask; you ask and do not receive because you ask evilly" 4:2b-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Petitioning involves trust and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as the motive for our petition is pure, we can petition as much as we want.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>3 Our prayers should involve meditation and supplication, that is, going before the Lord to pray on behalf of others Col 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Strictly speaking, this is participating in the fellowship of the Lord as the High Priest, because He is praying for His people and their needs all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4 We should persevere in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The need for perseverance or earnestness in prayer does not meant that it is difficult for God to answer our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Persevering in prayer means that we should clearly identify God's need before Him and persist in praying about it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If this is the case, why does not God answer us immediately?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why does He delay His answer?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are at least two reasons for this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, God wants His people to have an adequate reaction to His deep longings and concerns.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second, certain necessities and circumstances have a need for persevering prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Satan has strongholds, and we have to offer up strong prayers before these strongholds can be torn down Mark 9:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>5 We should have reigning prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be joined to the Lord on the throne Eph 2:6 , who is the Lord over all, and we must pray according to the name which is above every name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>6 We should have fighting prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should deal with matters by exalting the victory of the cross through our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The direction of our prayer should follow that of the Lord's victory 6:10-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>7 We should have faith in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Under certain circumstances, the Holy Spirit will give men an inward assurance; they will know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When this happens, their prayers will be answered immediately Acts 9:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>8 We should be burdened for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Prayer is like a spiritual travail for birth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is fellowshipping with the Lord's suffering, fellowshipping with the Father's heart, and being in harmony with the Spirit's groaning until the day of glory Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Question: What is the central goal of prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Answer: The central goal of prayer is for God to have a glorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The central subject of prayer is to prepare a glorious church for Christ, a church that will match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the revelation of the whole Bible and God's central goal, and we must pay special attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is also the Lord's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before He was crucified, His prayer revealed this desire John 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the same time, we can see the same desire in Paul's Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This does not mean that we should pray less for other things; it merely shows us the central goal of all our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once we have this goal in us, we can raise other prayers to a higher level.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we see that the gospel not only brings men out of death and into life but also joins men in an unspeakably wonderful union with the glorious Christ, our prayer for the world will only increase; it will not decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Carrying this one step further, there is a great need today for the world to see the glory of Christ through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church, through the Spirit, should convince the world that it is the channel through which blessing is brought to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Finally, God wants us to enter into a more intelligent and deeper fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He wants us as His many sons to come to Him through His beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He wants many priests to accompany the High Priest, who is living forever to intercede for us, and to bear the work of supplication before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father" Rev 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"But you are...a royal priesthood" 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
