<h1 class="title">THE VISION IN THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS<br />
OF THE SCRIPTURES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26-28; 2:7-12, 16, 18-24; Rev. 21:2-3, 9-14, 18-19, 21-24; 22:1-5; 4:2-3</h1>
<p>We worship God that we could have this conference to concentrate our attention on this one topic&mdash;the building of the church. If we carefully read the Word from the beginning to the end in the light of God, we will see that the building of the church is a great revelation shown throughout the Scriptures. To reveal this matter requires the entire Bible. Therefore, we will cover many verses from the Scriptures, all of which are very important and which you must read carefully and attentively. Furthermore, as you review, ruminate over, and reflect on these messages before the Lord, I hope that you would check and refer to the verses. In this way, your understanding of these messages will be clearer and more thorough.</p>
<p>There is one matter concerning these meetings that requires a special explanation. For the release of the vision of the building, we will not have the meetings as we did in the past&mdash;always caring for the apprehension of the audience. Instead, we will simply do our best to release this glorious vision from the Word of God from an objective standpoint. Our prayer is that this vision will be released clearly and thoroughly. Therefore, we will not be able to take care of any other need. Concerning this, we ask that you would do your best to cooperate with us and to render us your help. I have a deep sense before the Lord that a very heavy burden is upon me to reveal to the children of God the vision of the mystery concerning the eternal purpose of God. This is not an easy task. Human words are not sufficient to convey this matter, and human thoughts are inadequate for understanding it. Therefore, I hope that while you are listening, you would also be looking to the Lord that He would support the one serving as His mouthpiece so that the one speaking may be able to thoroughly release the vision according to the Lord&rsquo;s plan and arrangement.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING A TRANSCENDENT VIEW<br />
OF THE GLORIOUS VISION</h2>
<p>In this conference I have a deep expectation that you would be carried away to a high place, far above all, to have a far-reaching view of God&rsquo;s vision. In Revelation when the apostle John saw the vision of Babylon, the corrupted city, he was in the wilderness, a place of desolation. However, in order to see the New Jerusalem, the glorious, holy city, he was brought by an angel to a high mountain. This was because the view from the plain was not adequate. He needed to be brought to a mountain, a high place, a transcendent realm, that he might have a sufficiently far-reaching and great view. Therefore, I earnestly look to the Lord in His presence that He would bring us all up to a high mountain, a high place, and release every one of us from ourselves, bringing us out of our own experiences, learning, and past attainments and lifting us up to a new realm, an elevated sphere, that we have never reached before so that we would have a transcendent view of the glorious vision of God.</p>
<p>We must realize that the visions in the book of Revelation were revealed by God to a deeply and highly experienced person&mdash;the apostle John. When John saw the visions on the island of Patmos, all the other apostles had already died, and he was the only one left. He was the last of the original twelve apostles remaining. He truly was a highly qualified person, yet God wanted to show him a new vision never before seen by man, a great and far-reaching vision, a high and transcendent vision. Therefore, God had to put him on an island in isolation. Furthermore, God had to carry him away from the plain and even away from himself onto the top of a high mountain for him to see the vision. How I wish that every brother and sister would have such an attitude and desire and that we would tell the Lord, &ldquo;I want to be released and carried away from myself. I want to be freed not only from my wicked sins but also from my good, spiritual experiences. Although I have had many attainments already, I want to see a vision that is higher, greater, deeper, richer, and more far-reaching and transcendent.&rdquo; May God have mercy on every one of us that we would be rescued and carried away from ourselves to a transcendent position that we may have a transcendent view, a far-reaching sight, to see through all things so that we may see the glorious vision of God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
