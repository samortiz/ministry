   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>24 THE CITY'S DIMENSIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our twenty-fourth point is that this city has three equal dimensions Rev 21:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the entire Bible the only other structure that is equal in all three dimensions is the holiest of all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether in the tabernacle or in the temple, the holiest of all was always in three equal dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the tabernacle it was ten by ten by ten cubits, and in the temple it was twenty by twenty by twenty cubits 1 Kings 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The entire city of the New Jerusalem is in three equal dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This proves that the whole city is the holiest of all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Holiness is the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Love reveals God's heart, righteousness is God's way, and holiness is God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only God Himself is holy, for only God is separated and uniquely different from everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The New Jerusalem is a city which is absolutely saturated and mingled with God; therefore it is absolutely holy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is entirely different from all other things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we experience the mingling of God with us today, there is a real separation, a real holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In anything we do, if we have some experience of God in Christ being mingled with us, we experience holiness in that very thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Holiness signifies a separation from common things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more you are mingled with God in Christ, the more you will be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You will be different and separated from all things common.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be holy means to have something of God mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Holiness is not a matter of action, but a matter of nature, for holiness is God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not what we do, but how much we have been mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An aloofness from everything is not holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Holiness is determined by how much we have experienced being mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Chapter 12 of Hebrews says that God chastens us that we might be partakers of His holiness v. 10 . That means that He chastens us that we may partake of His nature by being mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Jerusalem is absolutely and thoroughly mingled with God; therefore it is the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>25 THE "NEW JERUSALEM"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our twenty-fifth point concerns the name of this city.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why is it called the "New Jerusalem" Rev 21:2 ?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is the newness?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Again, it is God Himself, for only God is new.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church life we need both holiness and newness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church life must not be common, and the church life must not be old.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we attend some Christian meetings, our only impression is a sense of oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 5 says that the church must be without spot or wrinkle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A spot speaks of something which has been damaged, whereas wrinkles are the sign of oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church must be without spot, without any wound or damage from the enemy, and the church must be without wrinkles due to oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should never say that we are an old church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church must be very new, without a trace of oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every day the church must be new.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we experience Christ day by day, we can maintain this newness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, if we do not grow daily in our experiences of Christ, we will perpetuate something old.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our experience may have been new last year, but it is much too old to apply this year.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must grow in Christ to have the newness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church is the one new man; it will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may tell how much a local church has grown by observing one factor: if the situation and atmosphere of the meeting is the same this year as it was last year, then there is oldness; there has been no growth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other hand, if the church is continually growing, the meetings will be continually new.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the holy city the tree of life brings forth a new kind of fruit every month Rev 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is so rich we can never exhaust Him!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must have some new experiences of Christ every day to keep ourselves in newness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This newness and freshness are a proof that the church is growing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>26 GOD AS LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our twenty-sixth point is that in this city there is no need of any man-made light or even of any natural light such as the sun Rev 21:23; 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the church life we do not need either of these, for we have God in Christ as our light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Natural light signifies our natural sight or insight.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many times in the meetings of the church some brothers and sisters bring in their natural insight.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And sometimes in the meetings people bring in light manufactured by human hands.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the church life both natural light and manufactured light must be dealt with and rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must trust in God and experience Christ; then this very God in Christ will become our light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is light manufactured by human hands?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Suppose that in the local church there is a brother whose mentality is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, someone recommends that he should go to see a psychiatrist.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This signifies the light of the lamp, the manufactured human light.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You may ask what we should do then with this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must pray, and sometimes we must even fast.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to deny the human way and look to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He will be our light; He will enlighten us as to what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In all things we must deny the natural way, the natural light, as well as the human way, the human light.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must trust in the Lord, realizing that He is our light.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to experience God more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the holy city, there is only God; God Himself must be our experience in all aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some brothers have too many lights: they have the light of the sun, the light of the moon, the light of the stars, the light of candles, the light of oil lamps and electric lights.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They have too many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the church life we must learn how to drop all these kinds of lights.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is only one light which is needed, and that is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He is the light and the way!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must reject all other ways, all other lights.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To do this involves learning some real lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>27 WITHOUT NIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our twenty-seventh point is that there is no night in the New Jerusalem Rev 21:25; 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have previously indicated that day and night will continue in the new earth, for there is still the sun and the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But because God enlightens the holy city, neither the sun nor the moon is needed; thus there is no night within the city.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What is the meaning of this?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>At night we are tired and asleep; hence, the absence of night signifies that we will never be tired.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the New Jerusalem we will no longer require sleep, for we will continually experience resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We become tired because we are still in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Night is something of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Today, in the church life, we are still physically in the old creation; thus there is always a certain period when we are tired.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Spiritually speaking, however, we should never be tired; we should never grow weary in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There should not be any night in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>28 TWO CURRENTS AND TWO CITIES</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In our twenty-eighth point we must see that throughout the Scriptures there are two currents with two cities.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>One current is of Satan, and the other is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>With the current of Satan there is a city called the Great Babylon Rev 17:5 , and with the current of God there is the holy city, New Jerusalem Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The book of Revelation unveils these two cities.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Great Babylon is none other than the mingling of Satan with the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the eyes of God, Babylon consists of all the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>On the other hand, the New Jerusalem is the mingling of God with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>These two cities are never compatible.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The holy city is always separated from Great Babylon, and Babylon is always seeking to damage the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Eventually God must intervene to judge Great Babylon and build up the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Even so, if the church is to be adequately built up today, there must always be a judgment upon all worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Worldliness is the very element of Great Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If we bring anything worldly into the building of the church, we are mixing Babylon with the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>God will never allow this!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He will come in to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We must be constantly alert to keep the building of the church separated from anything worldly, anything of the Babylonian city and its elements.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>May we bring all of these points to the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Pray for the church regarding all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I believe God's Word will not be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Something will be worked out on this earth, because God's Word has been released.</S>
