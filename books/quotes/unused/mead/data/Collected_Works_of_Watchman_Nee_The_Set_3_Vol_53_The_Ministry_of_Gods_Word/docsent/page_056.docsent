   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRANSLATING LIGHT INTO THOUGHTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This brings us to our second subject translating light into thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the time of revelation, God shines His light into man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The starting point of the ministry of the word is God's shining and enlightening within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The shining disappears in a moment; then we forget about it after a while.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is hard to grasp light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one can make this fleeting light the basis of his ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is impossible to take this flash of light as the source of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Something more is needed in order to have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One needs something more in addition to light: Thoughts are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a man has been dealt with by the Lord and his outward man is broken and torn down, he will spontaneously be enriched in his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only those who are rich in thoughts are able to translate light into thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only those who are rich in thoughts are able to understand the light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A brother once said, "I must understand Greek before I can understand clearly the meaning of the word and before I can translate its meaning more clearly to myself."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the same principle, light is God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It conveys God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet if we do not have thoughts, we do not know the meaning of the light, and we do not know the content of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our thoughts must be powerful and rich enough in order to understand the meaning and content of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When our thoughts are strong, we capture the light, and we are able to translate it into intelligible thoughts for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We only remember the light after we have translated it into thoughts that are understandable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can only remember our thoughts; we cannot remember light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only after we have translated the light we have seen into our thoughts are we able to retain the light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before light is transformed into thoughts, we cannot remember what the light was all about, nor can we retain the content of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the light becomes thoughts which, in turn, unveil the significance of the light, we can remember the light and retain it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we see the crucial significance of our thoughts, our mind, and our understanding in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In learning to serve as a minister of the word, we have to realize the significance of the word mind in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That chapter directs our attention to the matter of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to pay attention to the matter of prophesying because it makes the mind fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This chapter does not emphasize speaking in tongues because it makes the mind unfruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 14 says, "For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 15 says, "What then?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing also with the mind."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 19 says, "But in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man's mind occupies a crucial part in the ministry of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is God's intention that light reach the mind of every minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When light shines, it first shines in man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But God does not want this light to remain in the spirit; He wants this light to reach man's understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once light reaches man's understanding, it will never fly away; it will be retained in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Revelation is instantaneous; it flashes and goes away like lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when this light shines and man's mind is enlightened, the latter begins to interpret the former.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus the light is retained, and we discover the content of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When light is in the spirit, it can come and go as it pleases.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But once it reaches our mind and our understanding, it is retained.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From that point onward, we can utilize this light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should remember that light is unusable when it is only in our spirit; it has not become utilizable light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before God we are a "living soul" Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If something has not reached our soul, our personality cannot make any use of it, and our will cannot control it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not just spiritual entities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have a spirit, a soul, and a body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the light of revelation is in our spirit, we cannot say that this light is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The light of revelation should not remain in the spirit; it must reach our outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The outward man cannot receive any revelation; revelation comes into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But revelation cannot remain in our spirit; it must reach our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The translation of light into thoughts varies in different people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a man is rich in thoughts, he will make a great difference in this respect.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a man's thoughts cannot match God's light, God's light will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a vessel cannot match God's light because of either its limitation or lack of capacity, God's light will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If God's light comes to a man and his thoughts are sharp and in focus, they will retain the light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A wandering mind cannot retain God's light, nor will distracting thoughts understand the light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You may know that light is present, yet because of distractions and unrelated burdens, you cannot translate the light you see into thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some thoughts are not wandering or unduly burdened, but they are dull.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When God's light shines on them, they do not know what it is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God has one basic requirement for those who serve as ministers of His word their minds must be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The problem with many people is that their minds are active yet confused.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They cannot translate God's light; they have no way to know what the light means.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many people's thoughts are too shallow; they are constantly paying attention to low things.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They cannot retain the light or find out what God's light means to them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God is light; light is God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, God's light is as great, as rich, and as transcendent as God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When God's light is unveiled and our thoughts are low, narrow, or confused, we will surely miss much of its shining.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God has no intention of giving us small revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If God gives a man any revelation, that revelation is always great, and its scope and content are always rich.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Anything that comes from the God of glory has to be glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Everyone has to admit that God's measure to man is always an overflowing cup.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God is always rich, great, and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The problem today is that many minds do not have the capacity to contain this light.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Many people are too petty and low to contain God's profound light.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Brothers, if our thoughts are undisciplined and out of focus all day long, how can we expect to retain God's light?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If God gives us light, yet our thoughts are so low and base, how can this light be retained, and how can we translate this light into intelligible thoughts?</S>
