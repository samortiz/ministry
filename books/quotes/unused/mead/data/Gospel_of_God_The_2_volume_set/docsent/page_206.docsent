   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Please remember that the repentance here is the foundation spoken of in the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The repentance here does not mean repentance in general, for in the previous verses there are six items of the words of the beginning of the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first is repentance from dead works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, we cannot take the repentance we have in our concept and equate it to the repentance here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must consider the context of the Scripture, and we must expound it according to the thought of the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The repentance spoken of by the apostle is the same as the repentance from dead works in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The meaning here is that after a man has believed in God and has been baptized, and after he has understood the coming judgment and the truth of resurrection, and has repented of dead works, he cannot repent again for what he has repented of.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once he is baptized, he cannot be baptized again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once he has believed in the teaching of judgment, he cannot try to believe again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once he has believed in the teaching of resurrection, he cannot try to believe again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word repentance here includes all six items mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The apostle did not repeat the words "to renew again" as many times as I did: to renew again the repentance from dead works, to renew again faith toward God, and to renew again this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He only needed to use the words to renew again once.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there had never been anything yet, we would use the words to begin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if there was something already, we would use the words to renew again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The apostle was afraid that we would not understand the meaning of renew, anakainizo.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, he added a further word again, palin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the repentance spoken of in verse 6 must refer to the repentance in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the repentance in verse 1 were mentioned as the second item, we might not be very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But thank the Lord, it is placed as the first item.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as it is the first item, we know that all the other items are like this one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostle was saying that the word of the beginning of Christ can be compared to the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For one to be a Christian, first there is the need for the repentance from dead works, to judge his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then he has to have faith in God, to be baptized, to have the laying on of hands, and to believe in the resurrection of the dead and the eternal judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these are foundational matters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once the foundation has been laid, there is no need to lay it again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While one is building on this foundation, even if his foot slips, there is no need to lay again the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if one wants to lay a foundation again, it is impossible to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, Brother Wu has just come into the meeting hall from the main entrance on Wen-teh Lane.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After he came into the alley from the entrance, and as he was turning the corner to come into the building, he slipped.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What then should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His goal is to come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now he has slipped.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does not need to start all the way from Wen-teh Lane again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He can rise up from where he has slipped.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The apostle was saying that once a person has been enlightened and has tasted of the heavenly gift, if he slips, he cannot repent from dead works again, believe in God again, be baptized again, have the laying on of hands again, and believe in resurrection and eternal judgment again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, the apostle has no intention to say that a man can perish again after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What he means is that after a Christian is regenerated, he cannot be re-regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At most we can be regenerated once.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The apostle was not saying that one is not allowed to repent again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was saying that it is impossible to repent by starting all over again.</S>
