   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DIVISIVENESS A. Definition</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In our natural makeup there is an element of divisiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we were saved, we probably did not realize that such an element existed within our being, that in our natural life there is the tendency to be divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Divisiveness is worse than naturalness or individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If someone is individualistic, he prefers to be left alone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He does not want others to bother him or to interfere with him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He simply wants to be whatever he is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But to be divisive is to cause division in an active way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In contrast to those who are individualistic, the divisive ones are aggressive to form parties.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They contact the saints with the aim of dividing them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They may even travel from place to place with the intention of causing division.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Divisiveness Damages the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One of Satan's main strategies against the Body of Christ is division.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consider what would happen if your hand was divided from your arm, your feet were divided from your legs, and your limbs were divided from your torso.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What type of body would you have?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You would be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The same principle can be applied to the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the members receive the life supply from the head, Christ, directly, and through the members indirectly by the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we, as the members of the Body of Christ, should endeavor to maintain the fellowship in oneness and not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the Body will be built up in love Eph 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 16:18, "I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.''</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we are built up, we are strong and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we are divided, we are weak and defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Have you ever been divisive?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Have you ever spoken anything against another saint?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Have you ever had divisive thoughts?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even listening to divisive talk is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Have you ever heard someone speaking against an elder or against the ministry that brought you the New Testament economy?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must reject and flee from such speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have done it ourselves, we need to repent to the Lord and to the ones to whom we have spoken in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have thought about, but not verbalized such things, then repentance to the Lord is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have heard others speak this way, we must repent to the Lord and tell the speaker that neither the Lord nor you agree with such divisive talk.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must deal with any division in us thoroughly so that we may be full-grown in Christ, and be built up into the Body of Christ to be the fullness of God.</S>
