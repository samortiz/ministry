<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>THE HOLINESS IN ENJOYING THE HOLY THINGS AND THE ACCEPTABLE WAY FOR THE OFFERING OF A VOW AND A FREEWILL OFFERING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Lev. 22:1-33</h1><p>Chapter twenty-two of Leviticus covers two things: the holiness in enjoying the holy things (vv. 2-16) and the acceptable way for the offering of a vow and a freewill offering (vv. 18-33).<h2 class=head1>I. THE HOLINESS IN ENJOYING THE HOLY THINGS</h2><p>We need holiness for the enjoyment of the holy things. In order to be qualified to enjoy the holy things, we need a certain amount of holiness. We need holiness, sanctification, separation to God, to a certain degree.<h2 class=head2>A. The Holy Things Sanctified to Jehovah by the Sons of Israel</h2><p>“Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they keep themselves apart from the holy things of the sons of Israel which they sanctify to Me, so that they may not profane My holy name: I am Jehovah. Say to them, Any man among all your offspring throughout your generations who comes near the holy things which the sons of Israel sanctify to Jehovah while he is unclean, that person shall be cut off from before Me: I am Jehovah” (vv. 2-3). The holy things here signify Christ, whom God gives to His serving ones for their enjoyment. Everything that the people offered to God is a type of Christ, whom God gives to us, the serving ones, for our enjoyment. Hence, the holy things are the Christ whom we experience and enjoy.<h2 class=head2>B. An Unclean Person Being Forbidden to Eat the Holy Things, Unless He Has Bathed His Flesh in Water, That He May Not Sin and Die</h2><p>In verses 3 through 9 we see that an unclean person was forbidden to eat the holy things, unless he had bathed his flesh in water, that he might not sin and die. This signifies that we should not enjoy Christ while we are defiled with unclean things, until we deal thoroughly with the defilement, that we may not be condemned and suffer spiritual death. This means that if we would enjoy Christ, we must be careful about our situation. If we are unclean or defiled in any way, we must have a thorough dealing, mainly by bathing, washing, ourselves in the Holy Spirit. Otherwise, we shall suffer a certain amount of spiritual death.<h2 class=head2>C. An Outsider, a Sojourner of a Priest, or a Hired Servant Being Forbidden to Eat the Holy Things</h2><p>“No outsider shall eat of a holy thing; a sojourner of a priest or a hired servant shall not eat of a holy thing” (v. 10). This signifies that an unsaved person or one who has no share in God’s service may not enjoy Christ. Such persons have no part in the priesthood and are forbidden to eat the holy things.
