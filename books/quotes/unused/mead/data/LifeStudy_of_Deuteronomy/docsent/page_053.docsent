   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DISCERNING WHETHER OR NOT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ONE IS SPREADING THE GERMS OF DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When some hear this word, they may say, "How can we tell who is divisive and who is not divisive?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can we discern who is wearing a mask and who is not wearing one?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Besides, among the divisive ones are there not some who are innocent?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Perhaps the one contacting us is innocent."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The person contacting you may be innocent, but, even though he is not knowledgeable, he may nevertheless be carrying the "germs" of division.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may then be infected with these germs, which can multiply very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An innocent one may be full of germs, and, through his contact with you, these germs can be transferred to you and cause you to be infected unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can you discern whether or not the person contacting you is transmitting to you the germs of division?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You need to be very careful in your listening.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the one speaking with you is living and full of life, without any germs of death, the more you talk with him, the more living you will become.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The divine life within you will rise higher and higher.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, if the one contacting you is spreading the germs of death, the more you talk with him, the more you will be deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The life within you will go down.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as your contact with this person causes you to be deadened, this is an indication that this one is spreading the germs of death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a brother or sister may speak to you in a nice, intimate, loving, and humble way, but as you listen, you inwardly sense that you are going down.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By this you can discern whether or not the one contacting you is spreading the germs of death and division.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, if you continue to listen to the speaking of such a divisive one, you may find that questions are rising up within you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Questions are often Satan's way of tempting us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In tempting Eve the serpent said to her, "Hath God said?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Gen 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As I pointed out in the Life-study of Genesis, a question mark is shaped like a serpent standing up and asking, "Hath God said?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After talking with a divisive one, you may be filled with questions questions about the church and about the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These questions may cause you to become cold toward the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, you may stop coming to the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually you may stop praying and reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead of being revived by the Lord each morning, you are killed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One of the best ways for germs to spread is through eating things that are unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that in order to be kept away from the germs of death and division, we need to have a proper spiritual diet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, as we will see in the next message, in Deuteronomy 14 Moses turns from the matters of division and apostasy to the matter of the holy diet.</S>
