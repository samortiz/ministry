<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SAINTS’ PRAISE TURNS TO THE KINGDOM</h1><h1 class=msg>Psalms 135 to 145</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Psa. 135:1-3, 21; 136:1-3; 137:1-9; 138:1-2, 4-5; 139:7, 17; 140:7; 142:5; 143:6, 10; 144:9; 145:1-6, 10-13, 18, 21</h1><p>The main Psalms of Book V that we have covered so far are Psalms 110 and 118 concerning Christ, Psalms 122, 126, and 132 concerning the house and the city, and Psalms 133 and 134 regarding the life in the house and in the city, that is, the life or the living of unity. I advise the young brothers and sisters to memorize all these Psalms.<p>With all these main Psalms and main points as a background, we come to the next group of psalms in Book V, Psalms 135 to 145. In these, the saints’ praise to God in the house and the city of God eventually turns to the reigning Christ and His Kingdom. There are eleven Psalms to cover this point.<h2 class=head1>PRAISE AND THANKSGIVING</h2><p>Psalm 135 opens with Hallelujah. Surely, whenever a Psalm begins in this way, it must contain something marvelous. “Hallelujah. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord. Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God, praise the Lord” (vv. 1-3). God’s servants have to praise Him in His house. Bear in mind that these verses are an exhortation to the saints in ancient times, in the Old Testament. If these verses were written for them, how much more should they be applied to us! If in ancient times the saints should praise God in such a way, how much more should we! How greatly we have been led astray by Christianity! I have been a Christian for many years, but no one has ever told me that I must praise God like this. I was continually taught and even trained to be silent. Oh, the deplorable teaching of Christianity today concerning silence! “Hallelujah. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord. Ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God, praise the Lord; for the Lord is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.” I can still remember attending the meetings in that kind of Christianity: I never felt free to laugh or rejoice; I was always careful to keep a sober face and not disturb the hushed atmosphere. But Psalm 135:3 says that to praise the Lord is pleasant. Oh, it is really pleasant to praise the Lord!<p>Psalm 135 closes with this verse: “Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Hallelujah” (v. 21). In Psalm 134 we have, “The Lord bless thee out of Zion,” but in Psalm 135 we have, “Blessed be the Lord out of Zion.” The Lord who dwells at Jerusalem is blessed out of Zion. The last word in Psalm 135 is “Hallelujah.” Psalm 135 begins with Hallelujah and ends with Hallelujah.<p>Now we come to Psalm 136. “O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever” (v. 1). To give Him praise is one thing, and to give Him thanks is another. We must give Him both praise and thanks. “O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever. O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever” (vv. 2-3). The Psalmist here gives thanks to the Lord, the God of gods, and the Lord of lords, for His mercy endureth for ever. What can we do but just give Him thanks.
