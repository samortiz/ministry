   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE TWOFOLD SIGNIFICANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF MOUNT HOREB A. The Mountain of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mount Horeb, where the law was given, has a twofold significance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, it is the mountain of God 3:1, 12; 4:27; 18:5; 24:13; Num 10:33; 1 Kings 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This mountain was the place for God s people to meet with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At Mount Horeb Aaron met Moses 4:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, also met him on this mountain 18:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s people should always meet together in the day of His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we all come to the Bible in the day, we shall be brought together at Mount Horeb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if some are in the day in coming to the Word and others are in the night, there will be disputing, fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The same Bible is to some believers a book of day, and to others, a book of night.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For centuries Christians have been fighting over the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible, of course, is not to blame.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The responsibility rests with the spiritual condition of those who read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the readers are in the night, they cause the Bible to become in their experience a book of night.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who falsely accuse us of teaching heresy are in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some claim that we teach evolution into God, that we teach that believers are deified and become God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What gross darkness!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Others deny the fact that we can abide in God and have Him abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They argue that it is not possible for sinners to dwell in God or have the almighty, holy God dwell in them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They actually insist that it is heresy to say that we can be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They claim that it is impossible for sinners to become one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who make such accusations are altogether in a religious night.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are also in the night of the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They have not entered into the day of God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I wonder how they would explain the fact that we are sons of God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible clearly reveals that, as children of God, we have been born of Him and possess His life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to 2 Peter 1:4, we are partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All those who accuse us of heresy need to put forth their interpretation of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Surely to partake of the divine nature implies enjoying it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such an understanding is in the day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, for those who are in the night, what we teach and preach is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some have even gone so far as to claim that it is blasphemy to teach that we can be one spirit with God and thus be what God is 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Moses was on the mountain with God, he was infused with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although Moses did not realize it, this infusion caused his face to shine with divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The same light which was a terrifying, consuming fire to the house of Jacob was a delightful, infusing light to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a further indication that whether the fire consumes us or infuses us depends on our standing and condition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are with those who make idols and offer sacrifices to them, the fire will be terrifying to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if we stand with Moses, the fire will be enjoyable and infusing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fire will then shine not upon us, nor even just through us, but it will shine by mingling with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If iron is placed in fire, the iron will eventually begin to glow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The glowing of the iron is caused by the mingling of the fire with the iron.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the iron is put into the fire and the fire penetrates the iron, the fire and the iron become one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, this mingling of the fire and the iron does not produce a third substance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Likewise, to say that man is mingled with God does not mean that this mingling produces a third entity, an entity which is neither God nor man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who make such an unfounded accusation concerning our teaching about mingling are in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To us, the truth of mingling is a marvelous aspect of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But to those who are in the night, it is nothing but heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By the Lord s mercy we are people of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have seen certain things in the Word, and we are enjoying them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In particular, we are enjoying the Lord s infusion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we abide under the shining of the Lord s face, we are infused with His element.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, because the Bible is in our experience Mount Horeb, the mountain of God, we meet together at this mountain and are truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As the mountain of God, Mount Horeb is also the place for God s seekers to meet with God 24:13, 15-18; 1 Kings 19:8 , to serve God Exo 3:12 , and to receive God s revelation and vision 3:1-3; 24:12-13; 1 Kings 19:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>B. Mount Sinai</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since Mount Horeb has a twofold significance, it may also be Mount Sinai Exo 19:11, 18, 20-24; 34:2-4; Gal 4:24-25; Heb 12:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although we meet together at the mountain of God where we serve God and receive His revelation and vision, for many other Christians this mountain is Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At Mount Sinai the sinfulness of God s people is exposed, and there is revealed the boundary which God has forbidden them to cross.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At Mount Sinai people cannot see God, and they cannot receive revelation or vision from God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead, they themselves are exposed and come to see the boundary God has set.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Unlike Moses, they must stay far away.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>C. Different People at Different Distances</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>with Respect to Mount Horeb</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Exodus we see at least three different classes of people who stood at different distances in relation to Mount Horeb.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Moses, perhaps accompanied by Joshua, was on the mountaintop being infused with God Exo 24:13; 34:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders were on the mountain worshipping afar off and watching 24:1, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The children of Israel were at the bottom of the mountain standing afar off and trembling 20:18, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Moses was being infused, others were at a distance worshipping and watching, and the majority were at the bottom of the mountain trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Where are you in your experience?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Are you being infused, are you watching, or are you trembling?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Where you are depends on your standing and on your condition.</S>
