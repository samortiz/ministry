   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This lesson concerns how Christians should work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we read the Bible, we should carefully meditate on the words and should consider the type of people to whom they refer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should learn to apply the verses in order to deal with different kinds of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should know which verses deal with those who do not believe the Bible, those who do not believe in God, those who do not believe in the existence of the spirit and soul, those who do not know they have sins, those who know they have sins, those who are indifferent, those who are eager for their salvation, those who are self-righteous, those who believe but do not have the assurance of salvation, those who have turned away, those who are disappointed, those who love the world, and those who refuse without a reason.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not need to argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We only need to read to them the words of the Bible in a prayerful way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible is the medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot examine and dispense medicine to a person carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must dispense the right medicine for the right sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, we must memorize the important verses and put marks in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way, we will be "always ready for a defense to everyone" 1 Pet 3:15 .</S>
