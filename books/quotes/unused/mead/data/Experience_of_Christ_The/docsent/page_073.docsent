   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO KNOW THE POWER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Lord put Himself under death, this death gave the best opportunity for the divine life within Him to come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although He lived in the human life, He did not live out the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, He lived out the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The human life in Him was put to death, and His divine life was lived out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The result was the expression, not of Jesus of Nazareth, but of the very God, the divine Person within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the way to know the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By the Lord's mercy and grace, we have come to know that the desire of God's heart is to express Himself through us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This expression, however, cannot be by our human life, but must be by the divine life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this expression, we must be willing to put aside our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord may give us certain helpers to assist us in this, a wife or husband, children, and the brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our environment helps us to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, we must be willing to be put under the death of the cross and to live a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This death will afford the opportunity for the divine life within us to be lived out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way we will know the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we still preserve our natural life and pray that God will help us in certain matters, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God will not answer the prayers to preserve our natural life, nor will He render any help to our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, He will say, "Don't pray for Me to help you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Go to the cross and remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you are willing, I will help you to be put on the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what it means to live the crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our family life and in the church life, we all need to go to the cross and remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The best way to know the power of Christ's resurrection in our married life is to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The unique way is not to pray; it is to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is true, not only in our family life, but even the more in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be a good brother or sister among the saints in the church life requires that we go to the cross to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not pray for God to change others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God will never answer such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, go to the cross and remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the way that is according to His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are willing to go to the cross and stay there, we shall know the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE WAY TO MANIFEST THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>AND TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you read the four Gospels again in the light of this vision, the Gospels will all be new to you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You will see that they are a record of a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In nearly every chapter we find the Lord Jesus living under the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He lived this way for the release of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because He lived a crucified life, He was never defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is possible to defeat a living person, but not a crucified person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The best way to escape the attacks of the enemy is not to counterattack; it is to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Satan attacks you, go to the cross and remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That is all you need to do.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan cannot defeat a crucified one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we have seen, crucifixion affords a base for the power of Christ's resurrection to rise up that the divine life may be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, there is no need for us to counterattack.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In fact, it will not always be necessary even to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What we need the most is to go to the cross and stay there to live a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do this, the divine life will be released and manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As long as we are willing to go to the cross and to remain there, everything will be in the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the way to know Christ and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is not a matter of doctrine, but of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the Lord give all of us the willingness and the determination to go to the cross and stay there that we may know the power of His resurrection.</S>
