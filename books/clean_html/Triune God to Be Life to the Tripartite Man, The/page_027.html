<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As the Spirit of Life</H2><P>As such a compound Spirit, He is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2a). The ingredients of creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension have been compounded together in this one Spirit. Now, this Spirit is the Spirit of life, waiting to be received and contained by the tripartite man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Imparting the Divine Life<br>to the Believers of Christ</H2><P>The Spirit of life imparts the divine life to the believers of Christ (2 Cor. 3:6b). We receive the Spirit of life by exercising our human spirit. When we exercise our spirit, immediately the compound Spirit, who is the Spirit of life and the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), enters into our spirit, imparting the divine life into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRIPARTITE MAN BEING CREATED<br>WITH A SPIRIT TO BE THE RECEIVER<br>AND CONTAINER OF THE DIVINE LIFE</H2><P>The Triune God as the life-giving Spirit desires to give life to man, but if man did not have a spirit to receive and contain Him, the Triune God would be unable to give life to man. Rain may fall on a stone for many hours, but the stone will be unable to receive the water, because it does not have a proper receiver to receive the water. However, if rain falls on a sponge, after a short time the water will soak and saturate the sponge, because the sponge has a proper receiver for the water. Eventually, the sponge will be mingled with the water. This illustrates how man with his spirit is a receiver and a container for the divine life.</P><P>Life is the mingling of God as the Spirit with man in his spirit. However, many people confuse life with virtues such as humility, meekness, or gentleness. Many of the students of Confucius are very humble and meek, but their humility and meekness are a matter of outward character. Life is God processed to be a life-giving Spirit to be received by the tripartite man, who was created with a spirit as the receiver and container of the Spirit, who is the Spirit of life.</P><P>Life is God as the Spirit mingling Himself with us in our spirit. In actual fact, we have such a mingling, but in our daily life we may not experience this mingling in a practical way. We may live in a way that annuls the mingling. When we sense that the mingling has ceased, we must confess to the Lord and receive the cleansing of the blood. Then, the anointing will return and the mingling will continue. This is life. Life is the very Triune God, in whom we believe, whom we serve, whom we worship, and whom we exalt, processed to be a life-giving Spirit to be received by us, the tripartite men, who have been created with a spirit to be the receiver and container of the divine Spirit as our life. This life does not know what it is to be humble or proud, good or evil. Life does have a number of attributes, and humility is one of these attributes; however, the humility of life is not something of human conduct. When we ask, "What should we do?" we are not in life. Life is as spontaneous as breathing. If we are in life, without any intention we will simply live out the attributes of life.</P>
