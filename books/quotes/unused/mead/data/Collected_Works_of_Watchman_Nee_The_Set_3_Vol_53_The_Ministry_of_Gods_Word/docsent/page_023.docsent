   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must condemn all independent revelations and independent ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second Peter 1:20 says, "No prophecy of Scripture is of one's own interpretation."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word own also can be translated as private.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It qualifies the word interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that God's prophecy cannot be interpreted just according to its immediate context; it cannot be interpreted from just the passage itself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, Matthew 24 cannot be interpreted by reference to just Matthew 24; we have to consider it in the light of other passages of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot interpret prophecy by the prophecy itself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot interpret Daniel 2 by reference to just Daniel 2, or Daniel 9 by just Daniel 9.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we interpret a text by the text itself, we are making a "private interpretation."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to remember that God's Word is one undivided whole.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to speak God's word, we have to realize first of all that it is an undivided whole.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>None of the Bible can be privately interpreted; it cannot be interpreted according to the immediate text alone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It has to be interpreted in conjunction with many other passages.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today we have the Bible before us; we cannot release any independent so-called "word of God" which is unrelated to God's established Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If our speaking does not match God's established Word, what we have is heresy and a deception of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first ministers of the word spoke independently for God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They spoke independently because there was no minister of the word before them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the second group had to build its speaking upon the speaking of the first group.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Its speaking should have been only a repetition and an amplification of the first group.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the third group comes along, it should build its speaking upon the first and second groups; it cannot speak independently either.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The light which God gives can only be a further application of that given to the first and second groups.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God may give new visions and new revelations, but these visions and revelations are based on words that He has already spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here is where the virtue of the Bereans comes in. They examined the Scriptures to see if what they had heard was indeed so Acts 17:10-11 . God's Word does not change from day to day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is an undivided whole, ever unchanging from beginning to end. It builds upon itself little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is building something that He Himself is after.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The men in the Old Testament and the New Testament who received further light did not receive any independent revelations; their revelations were all based on the first revelation in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That first revelation continued.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From one revelation more light developed; men's eyes were opened more and more, until we have both the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person becomes a New Testament minister of God's word by receiving visions of God's word in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anyone who wants to be a minister of the word today must consider God's word in view of the Old Testament and the New Testament; he cannot have God's word apart from them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a very important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A minister of God's word today is not independent, just as the ministers of His word in the former days were not independent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All ministers of the word depend on God's previously spoken word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one can receive revelation apart from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Anyone who receives a revelation apart from the Bible is receiving heresy, something which is absolutely unacceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Among God's children there is a big misunderstanding concerning the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some think that these two testaments contradict each another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They think that the law and grace contradict one another.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in reading God's Word, can we find the Old Testament contradicting the New Testament or the law contradicting grace?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we read the Epistles to the Romans and Galatians, we will find that there is no contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In fact, Galatians shows us that the two testaments compliment each other.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many people have the wrong notion that the law and grace contradict each other, because they notice that God deals with men in one way in the Old Testament and in another way in the New.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They think that the Old Testament and the New contradict each other because God appears to men differently under the law and under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They do not realize that the New Testament is an advancement of the Old Testament, not a contradiction of it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Grace is an advancement of the law, not a contradiction of it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should realize that the New Testament is a continuation and further development of the Old Testament; the two do not contradict each other at all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul tells us that grace did not begin in just the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In reading Galatians, we find that the "promise" was given when God called Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, God preached the gospel to Abraham and told him to wait for Christ, through whom blessing would come upon the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the time God granted Abraham grace, the law had not come in yet.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Galatians tells us clearly that God did not give Abraham the law but a promise, which was the gospel 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Galatians Paul says that our gospel is based on Abraham's gospel and that our grace is based on the grace that Abraham received.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The promise we have received is based on the promise given to Abraham, and the Christ we have received is the very seed of Abraham vv.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>9, 14, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul clearly shows that both the Old Testament and New Testament follow the same line.</S>
