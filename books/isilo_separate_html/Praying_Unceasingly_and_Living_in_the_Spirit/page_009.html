<p>For example, there are two ways for the younger saints to be subject to the older saints. One involves a picture of subjection, and the other way is living the reality of subjection. If I live Christ, how can I not be subject to the older saints? How can I live loosely or indulge the flesh if I am living Christ? However, if I do not indulge in the flesh but also do not live Christ, I am only practicing asceticism, like that of Hinduism. I may have a high morality, but if I do not live Christ, my living is no different from the practices taught by Chinese neo-Confucianists, like Wang Yang-Ming. The Lord wants Christ to be lived out of our spirit. If we would live in our spirit, our problems would be resolved.</p>
<p>There are also two ways for us to keep the ground of oneness. One way is to have a picture based on the doctrinal knowledge of keeping the local ground and not being divided. The other way is by living Christ, for genuine oneness is in Christ. Christ is not divided; if we live Christ, we will not be divided from the saints. Recently, I gave ten messages in Anaheim on the ground of oneness (see the book <em>The Genuine Ground of Oneness</em>). My approach to these ten messages was completely different from the past, but the truth was not different. My former approach was to draw a picture, but this time I asked whether we live Christ. To live Christ is to be one and to be in the oneness. The oneness spoken of in John 17 does not depend on methods but on the oneness in the Triune God. Verse 23 says, &ldquo;I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.&rdquo; If we live in our spirit and live in the Triune God, what we live out will spontaneously be oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We must ask whether we are walking according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4). We must be persons who walk according to the spirit. &ldquo;I was in spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; is the solution to everything (Rev. 1:10). For example, if we follow the spirit, we will know whether we should go to Taichung or to Hualien. Our only desire is to be in spirit, because the spirit is the solution to every problem.</p>
<p>If the Lord cannot gain a group of people on the earth who live in the mingled spirit, He will have no way. He does not need a large number of people, but He must gain a people on the earth who not only stand on the recovered ground of the oneness of the church but also live Christ in the human spirit. Otherwise, the Lord has no way. Whether we are taking care of the churches or going out for the propagation, everything that we do in ourselves is merely a work. This work may be on the proper ground, but it is a picture that only looks like reality. Without living Christ, there is no reality in our living.</p>
<p>Some of the local churches are so desolate that they do not even have the picture. But this does not mean that having the picture is equal to having a living. In the past we have paid too much attention to pictures. The Lord wants us to live the reality, but in order to live the reality, we must be in our spirit. Whenever we are not in our spirit, we are only drawing pictures.</p>
<p>We are on the proper ground, but we have been hindered by substitutes. We have the most noble and superior substitutes&mdash;our truth is superior, our doctrines are superior, our light is superior, and even our spiritual cultivation is superior. However, regardless of how superior these things may be, they are not Christ. Nevertheless, we should not say that we do not want a certain positive thing because it is not Christ. Culture is an example. Although culture is not Christ, without culture, including being subject to laws, we would become barbarians. This is not acceptable either.</p>
<p>Some brothers deal with the flesh in fear and trembling and accept the breaking of the cross but do not live Christ. Although this is better than letting the flesh erupt, this &ldquo;better&rdquo; thing will become a substitute for Christ. A person whose flesh erupts can repent and receive the Lord, but a person whose flesh does not erupt often holds on to substitutes. In China it was easy for some of the bandits and robbers and those who led a dissolute life to be saved upon hearing the gospel, but it was not as easy for the well-mannered followers of Confucius and Mencius to be saved upon hearing the gospel. The teachings of Confucius and Mencius are good, and culture is needed in human society, but Christ does not have a way with those who are deeply rooted in culture.</p>
<p>This word is not to encourage us to be barbaric or to be foolish; that would ruin our future. More than fifty years of testing prove that our way and our ground are unshakable. On the one hand, the truth is always victorious. On the other hand, we must live out Christ while taking the way of the truth and standing on this ground of the truth. The Lord does not want godliness or breaking; He wants the release of the Spirit. The exercise of godliness and the breaking of the flesh are helpful, but they are not Christ, nor are they the reality of the Spirit. The younger saints need to see and practice living in the spirit while they are young. The church is built up in our spirit. The younger saints can be subject to the older saints in this spirit. The breaking is also in this spirit. Instead of using our own methods to break ourselves, we should live in the spirit. Then what needs to be broken will be broken.</p>
<p>Hence, we must pray unceasingly. To pray unceasingly is to live in the spirit. In other words, only by praying unceasingly can we live in the spirit, because praying unceasingly is the only way to live in the spirit. If we do not pray, we are not in the spirit, but as soon as we pray, we are in the spirit. Revelation 1:10 says, &ldquo;I was in spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo; Hence, whenever we are in our spirit, it is the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Every day should be the Lord&rsquo;s Day, because we should be in our spirit every day. This is to live Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
