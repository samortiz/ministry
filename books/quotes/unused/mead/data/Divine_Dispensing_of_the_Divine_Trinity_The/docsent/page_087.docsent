   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WITNESS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This leading One is also the witnessing One.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is a Witness within us who testifies that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that within us Someone is reminding us that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes this reminding One regulates us or safeguards us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This regulating comes from a living Person, the Spirit, who is witnessing with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Often we have exercised our mind to try to figure out certain things related to our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We know from experience that this is a distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What we need is the living witness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to 8:16, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, not with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul says clearly and explicitly that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the human spirit is neglected by most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let me tell you how a certain sister experienced the Spirit witnessing with her spirit that she is a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This sister went into a restaurant and ordered two hamburgers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the one serving her charged her for only one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Within this sister was a reminder that she is a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sister was thinking that perhaps others would laugh at her if she said that she was charged for one hamburger instead of two.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But as she was considering what to do, she continued to sense the Spirit reminding her that she is a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, she told the person who sold her the hamburgers, I am a child of God, and I need to pay you for the second hamburger.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I believe that many of us have had similar experiences of the Spirit witnessing with our spirit that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is also a divine provision.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus far we have seen from Romans 8 that we have three divine provisions: the law of the Spirit of life v. 2 , the leading of the Spirit v. 14 , and the witness of the Spirit v. 16 . Now in verse 23 we see another divine provision the firstfruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word firstfruit here refers to a foretaste that is a guarantee that we shall experience the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God Himself is the full taste, and He has given us His Spirit as the firstfruit to be our foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that within us we have the Spirit of God for our enjoyment, and this enjoyment is the foretaste and guarantee that we shall have the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the guarantee that at the Lord s coming back we shall enjoy God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Praise the Lord that we have the Spirit within us as the foretaste!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In chapter eight of Romans we see the wonderful divine provisions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have the divine law, the leading of the Spirit, the witness of the Spirit, and the Spirit as the foretaste for the coming full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Triune God has afforded us these rich, divine provisions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every aspect of the divine provisions is actually the processed Triune God who is now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The law of the Spirit of life, the leading of the Spirit, the witnessing of the Spirit, and the Spirit as the foretaste are all the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After passing through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, our God has become the Spirit dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now in this Spirit we have the law, the leading, the witnessing, and the foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord for these provisions!</S>
