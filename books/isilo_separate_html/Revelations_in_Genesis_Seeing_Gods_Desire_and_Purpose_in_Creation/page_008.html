Determining to Create the Maturity of Life</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:26 says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.&rdquo; After God created all the living animals, He created man. Among all created life, man has the highest consciousness and the highest level of life. In God&rsquo;s restoration of creation, His ultimate desire is to gain man. Therefore, God&rsquo;s creation of man differs from His creation of other creatures; it began with a council of the Godhead. &ldquo;God said, Let Us...&rdquo;; this is the first time in the Bible that God called Himself &ldquo;Us.&rdquo; This shows that God is triune. The Triune God had a council of the Godhead concerning the creation of man. In this council God determined to create the highest level of life&mdash;man&mdash;in His image and according to His likeness.</p>
<p>According to spiritual significance, this signifies the life of God maturing in us. In the process of creation the life of man is likened to the life of God. The end of our growth in life is our becoming like God. This matter is initiated by God and determined by God; He will conform us to the image of His Son and glorify us (Rom. 8:29-30). God has determined this and will carry it out in us. Therefore, the maturity of life is God&rsquo;s will, is of God, and is initiated by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Creating Man&mdash;the Maturity of Life</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:27 and 28 say, &ldquo;God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.&rdquo; This is the final step of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>Verse 26 mentions the council of God concerning the creation of man. Verses 27 and 28 mention the carrying out of God&rsquo;s creation of man. The man that God created had the highest level of created life on the earth, possessing God&rsquo;s image to have dominion for Him. Then God&rsquo;s creation was complete. This signifies the maturity of life. When God&rsquo;s life matures within us, we are able to express God&rsquo;s image and have dominion for God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS OF GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION OF CREATION</h2>
<p>From the process of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation, we can see that God&rsquo;s restoration of creation is focused on three things. The first focus of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation is to gain the earth. The Spirit and light came and did many works of separation in order to remove the traces of judgment and the curse and to cause the harmony and beauty of creation to reappear on the earth. When the earth was restored, God gained a place on which life could grow and where He could reign. Therefore, the earth is a focus of God&rsquo;s attention in His creation.</p>
<p>The second focus of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation is to gain man. From the record of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation, we see that God&rsquo;s creation is for gaining man. Every step of God&rsquo;s creation was a preparatory work for God to create man. When man was created, God&rsquo;s work was finished, and He rested (vv. 26, 31; 2:1-3). The goal of God&rsquo;s creation is to gain man, because only man can express God&rsquo;s image, rule and have dominion on the earth, and deal with God&rsquo;s enemy (1:26, 28). Thus, only man can achieve God&rsquo;s purpose and give God rest. The focus of God&rsquo;s creation is to gain man so that God&rsquo;s purpose may be achieved. </p>
<p>The third focus of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation is to have life. In Genesis God repeatedly paid attention to life. God created countless things, but He did not mention them; He mentioned only the things related to life and the living creatures. This shows that God&rsquo;s creation is focused on life.</p>
<p>Every form of life that God mentioned has implications for our spiritual life because God knows that only His life can achieve His purpose. However, only by His life growing in man unto maturity can man express God and exercise dominion for Him. This is the reason that God paid particular attention to life in His work of creation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
