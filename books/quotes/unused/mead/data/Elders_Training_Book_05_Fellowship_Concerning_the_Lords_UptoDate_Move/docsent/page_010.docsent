   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SEEING AND MINISTERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MYSTERY OF GODLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe this is why the Apostle Paul, after writing Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews, wrote 1 Timothy in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was so experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He knew the secret of how to take care of the church under degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, in this book he stressed the truth, the word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said God desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He also said the church, which is the house of the living God, is the pillar and base of the truth 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The truth is the mystery of godliness, and this mystery of godliness is the manifestation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that, as a church, surely all the members have to know the manifestation of the Triune God, to know the mystery of godliness, to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The truth in 1 Timothy 2:4 is not the truth mainly concerning baptism, nor the truth mainly concerning the gifts, but the truth concerning the Triune God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Can the elders teach such a truth concerning the embodiment of the Triune God and the realization of this embodiment, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You may think it is wonderful to teach a little about justification by faith, about holiness, and concerning the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is not the central lane of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is the pillar and base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not mainly the truth of items such as the presbytery, baptism, or even the smaller item of the miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The truth, of which the church is the pillar and base, is a great truth the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A proper church is the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should take care of such a truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord s recovery has brought us thus far to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Items like baptism and the gifts are more than elementary, something in the stage of kindergarten.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Where are we now?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are in the embodiment of the Triune God realized by the all-inclusive Spirit who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may say that you are in the recovery, that you are one with the ministry, and that you are for the Lord s testimony today, but where are you actually?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I propose that we have a time for desperate prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is worthwhile to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fast and pray that the Lord would open your eyes to see such a vision of the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then you will have a vision and this vision will govern, direct, control, preserve, and protect you from being led astray.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then you will have the solid Word to minister to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is what we all need.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are no longer in kindergarten.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The new believers among us, no doubt, are still in kindergarten, but as a whole, the recovery today is not in kindergarten.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have carried out the standard education passing through kindergarten, elementary, junior high, and even high school.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today we are at least in college.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To stress anything low is to bring the recovery back to kindergarten.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The standard of education in the Lord s recovery is not that low today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fifty-two years ago it was, but not today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I say this based on the thirty-six messages I delivered to you in the 1984 elders training.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I encourage you to get a copy of these messages and at least to read through them once, but I also hope that you would study them, especially the first two books on the ministry of the New Testament and on the vision of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If possible you should study all four books.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I believe that anyone who reads these messages fairly would say that this is the Lord s up-to-date present word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>LABORING IN THE WORD AND TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I would ask the elders, who should be apt to teach and who should labor in word and in teaching, what they would teach.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To answer this question you have to go back to some of the verses in 1 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The truth in 1 Timothy 2:4 refers to the mystery of godliness which is the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul also charged the deacons to hold the mystery of the faith 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I were to ask some deacons to tell us what the mystery of the faith is, they might not be able.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Is faith in this verse the believing ability, the believing act, the so-called subjective faith, or is this objective faith, referring to the things we believe in?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even some elders may not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why I have a deep and heavy concern for all the brothers in the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do we all really labor?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To labor is not just to work but to toil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the elders would be laboring in the Word and in teaching, I believe that all the local churches would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To labor in the Spirit and forget about the Word only results in confusion and vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Southern Baptists would not allow their pastors to emphasize the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They labor on the Word and forget about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the Pentecostal movement they labor on the Spirit and forget about the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Which result is higher?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Southern Baptists are the largest denomination in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the result of taking the Word first.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We would not take the way of the Southern Baptists or the way of the Pentecostals.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The way we would take is to focus on the Word by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the Bible the Word is first and not the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The entire New Testament points to the Word first; then you come to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do not forget this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then out of this Word comes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Spirit is the consummation of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Spirit is not the foundation or the source.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I like the Spirit because the Spirit is my enjoyment; the Spirit does every work for me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>With the Word, however, I have to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I have to labor on book after book, chapter after chapter, and item after item.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To pick up all the verses on the divine Word from the twenty-seven books of the New Testament requires a lot of labor.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is what you should do.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do not expect that you could build up the church in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The church could only be built up on the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Otherwise, it could never be the pillar and base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all have to labor in the Word and in teaching, and we all have to hold the mystery of the faith, the mystery of what we believe in.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The cause of all the problems among us has been the shortage of the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A shortage of the knowledge of the truth means ignorance, blindness, and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Without electricity in the room enabling the lights to shine, we would make a lot of blunders in the darkness; we would do a lot of nonsensical things.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is why I have a real burden that we would all reconsider our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is altogether a pitiful thing to remain in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is why we began this training with Acts 26:19 and Proverbs 29:18.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need the heavenly vision because without this vision we will run wild.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We need the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
