   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. INCREASE OF REJECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first thing we face on this pathway is rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because Christ is the rejected One, we must be rejected also.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not expect to be welcomed, for no one will welcome you until the glory comes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, you must be willing to be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 13:53 14:13 we see the increase of rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many of us have experienced some measure of rejection by those who opposed our coming into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But I need to tell you that this rejection will not decrease; rather, it will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There will be rejection upon rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Be prepared for this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A. Rejection by the Galileans 1.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Knowing Him according to the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>and Blinded by Their Natural Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The heavenly King was rejected firstly by the Jewish religionists.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The religious leaders rejected Christ to the uttermost because they were fully occupied, possessed, and veiled by their religion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because religion was everything to them, they could not recognize this heavenly King.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Blinded by the religious veils, they rejected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After the Lord had been rejected in Jerusalem, the religious center, He turned to a geographical area that was not so religious Galilee, the place where He was born and raised.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Galilee was rather close to Gentile territory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, He was not even welcomed in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although the Galileans did not oppose Him, they rejected Him because of their natural knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When they saw Him and heard Him speak, they said, Is not this the carpenter s son?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And his sisters, are they not all with us?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Where then did this man get all these things?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>13:55-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here we see that the Galileans knew Him according to the flesh, not according to the spirit 2 Cor 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thinking that they knew everything about Him, they were blinded by their natural knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They saw the wonders, the miracles, He did, but they were preoccupied by their natural concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The religious people were preoccupied by their religion and by their religious concepts, and the Galileans were preoccupied by their natural knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we would know Christ and follow Him, we need to realize that religion and natural knowledge are both veils.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some of our opposers belittle us by saying that we do not have theological training.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the Lord Jesus, a carpenter s son, had no theological training Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Nee, the one who helped me so much, much more than anyone else, had no theological training either.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Religion and natural knowledge are two great obstacles frustrating people from recognizing who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you follow religion, you will remain in Jerusalem, and if you follow your natural knowledge, you will be in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But Christ neither stays in Jerusalem nor remains in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we shall see, He departs to the desert.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because Jerusalem was filled with religious concepts and Galilee was filled with natural knowledge, the Lord went to the desert.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Are you in Jerusalem or Galilee, or are you in the desert?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the desert there is no religion, culture, or theological training.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Jerusalem there is religion and in Galilee there is natural knowledge, but in the desert there is the presence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Oh, in the desert we have Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is our boast and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not have religion or knowledge we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because we belittle knowledge, we have been condemned and accused of being mind benders.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But our minds are not being bent they are being renewed from natural and religious knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must be bold to declare that we are no longer religious or natural.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead of natural and religious knowledge, we have Christ as our wisdom, a wisdom that surpasses knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Any attempt to know Christ by natural knowledge will result in rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to natural knowledge, Christ was the son of a carpenter and his mother was an ordinary woman.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His countrymen knew all of His outward features, but they did not see that God was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 2 Corinthians 5:16 Paul says that, along with others, he knew Christ according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he knew Christ according to the flesh; he thought that Jesus was merely a little Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He did not realize that within Jesus was God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But one day on the road to Damascus the Lord Jesus said to him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When Saul asked the Lord who He was, He responded, I am Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the road to Damascus Saul realized that Jesus of Nazareth was now in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Jesus seemed to be saying, I was not only the flesh I was God, for the very God was in Me. Saul, you knew Me according to the flesh, not according to the spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to know other Christians not according to outward things, not according to their country, language, parentage, education, or outward appearance or qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we know Christians according to these things, we know them according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But we should know Christians according to the spirit, because Christ is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Several months ago, one of the opposers was invited to my home for lunch.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We spent more than three hours together.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At one point he said, You don t have scholars among you, do you?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have more than a hundred scholars with us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, eventually we, who are not supposed to have scholars among us, printed articles in the newspaper that the opposers are not able to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They have been troubled by so many carpenter s sons.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As we follow the Lord in His recovery, we should not know people according to the flesh or estimate them according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should know them according to one thing according to the measure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Knowledge, intelligence, and outward appearance mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Perhaps a certain brother cannot speak well and uses poor grammar.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Yet whenever he opens his mouth, Christ comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even when you are sitting in his presence, you realize that some amount of Christ is with him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the church life in the Lord s recovery we do not care for the outward appearance; we care only for the spirit within, where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the way to know Christ, the way to know other Christians, and the way to follow the Lord.</S>
