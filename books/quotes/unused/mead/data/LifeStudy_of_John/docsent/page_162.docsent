   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. DELIVERING HIMSELF IN VOLUNTARY BOLDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE PROCESSED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord delivered Himself in voluntary boldness to be processed 18:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that He went into death willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 10 He told us that He would purposely give up His life for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the Lord of life, and He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He has authority to die, and He has the authority to be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of His own accord, He went into death and He came out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He does not have the problem of death; hence, it was unnecessary for Him to die.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was His prerogative whether He would die or not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He could will to die or will not to die.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To us, however, death is not a matter of choice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When death comes to visit us, we cannot say, Death, I am not ready.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please come again another day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have neither the power nor the authority to reject death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When death comes, everyone must be subdued by it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this was not so with the Lord, because He is the Lord of life and also life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If He did not prefer to die, He had the power and authority to reject death and not die.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He had the authority to send death away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although He was not forced or compelled to die, He was willing to die because He had come to impart Himself to us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He knew that it was only through death that He could release Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In fact, He had already said that He was the one grain of wheat that was to fall into the ground and die 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a grain of wheat is unwilling to die, how can it release its life to bring forth many grains?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In John 18 and 19 we see clearly that the Lord Jesus was very willing to die.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A. Going to the Garden</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first proof of the Lord s willingness to die was that He went to the garden 18:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that He went to a place where He could be captured.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In His long message recorded in John 14 through 16, He made the process so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then, in chapter seventeen, He prayed for the process.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After He prayed, He went to the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Lord went to the garden to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These three Gospels reveal that the Lord was the sin-bearer who was under the burden of bearing our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, He had to go to the Father and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But there is no such record in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John s record shows that He went to the garden not to pray but to present Himself to the process.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He went there to be captured, to be arrested, to be presented to death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that He voluntarily delivered Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord did not hide but willingly offered Himself to be processed, delivering Himself to the people who were to put Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>B. Betrayed by the False Disciple</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord knew that Judas would betray Him 13:11, 21-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not avoid it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This also proves that He voluntarily delivered Himself to be processed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Satan utilized the false disciple of the Lord to put Him to death, not knowing that by doing this he afforded the Lord the opportunity to be processed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord took this as an opportunity to be glorified 13:31-32 , that is, to be multiplied through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>C. The I Am Willing to Be Arrested</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Another indication of the Lord s willingness to die was that the people did not discover Him but that He came to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Judas, the false disciple, came with two kinds of people the political and the religious.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The soldiers were the political ones, and the deputies from the chief priests and Pharisees were the religious ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The religious circle worked with the political circle to put the Lord of life to death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, they did not find the Lord; the Lord came to them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The soldiers did not come to the Lord and capture Him while He was praying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No, Jesus went forth to meet them and said, Whom are you seeking?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They answered, Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then the Lord said to them, I am 18:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When they heard this word, they drew back and fell to the ground 18:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They were frightened at this word I am, which is the meaning of the name Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This indicates that the One they came to arrest was Jehovah God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord did not take this opportunity to flee but asked them a second time, Whom are you seeking?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, it was not they who arrested the Lord; it was the Lord who handed Himself over to them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The name Jehovah means I Am that I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord Jesus is the great I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 8:24 the Lord had told the Jewish people, Unless you believe that I am, you shall die in your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In other words, if they did not believe that Jesus was Jehovah, the very God, they would die in their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Jewish people heard this, and when they heard it again, they fell down to the ground with fright.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord approached them the second time, asking, Whom are you seeking?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was not captured; He delivered Himself to them, proving His willingness to die.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If He had been unwilling to die, no one could have captured Him, for He could have frightened everyone and caused them to fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All He had to do was speak one word and His captors would have been dead.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How could they have seized Him if He were unwilling to be captured?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This proves that the purpose of John s Gospel is to show that the Lord is the Lord of life and that He was willing to die in order to release Himself as life.</S>
