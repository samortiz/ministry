   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some Prophets</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The prophets are the second class of gifts given by the ascended Christ Eph 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The prophets are those who through the Lord's revelation, speak for the Lord, speak forth the Lord, and speak the Lord into others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sometimes they are also moved to utter some predictions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the perfecting of the saints and the building up of the Body of Christ, they are second only to the apostles and are a very important class of people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some Evangelists</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The evangelists are the third class of persons given by the ascended Head.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They can preach Christ and the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel to save the desolate sinners, bringing them to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some Shepherds and Teachers</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The shepherds and teachers are the fourth class of persons given by the ascended Head.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the grammatical structure in Greek, the shepherds and teachers here refer to one class of gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The shepherds should know how to teach others, and the teachers should also know how to feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are able to shepherd and teach the believers and are also able to feed the new ones in the same way that a mother feeds, shepherds, leads, and teaches her children.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For the Perfecting of the Saints unto the Work of Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The four classes of persons the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers preach the gospel to save others on the one hand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the other hand, they raise up churches in the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then they also feed, shepherd, and teach the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, among these saints they speak for the Lord and speak the Lord into them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way all the saints are perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The meaning of perfecting can be illustrated by university students being taught by professors of different subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After four years of studying, they graduate and are able to do the same things that the professors do; they have all been perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ as the Head gave these four kinds of gifts to the church for the purpose of perfecting the saints that the latter may also be the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Unfortunately this is not the case in the existing system of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It only trains some preachers to gather a congregation on Sunday for a service where one speaks and the rest listen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most of them after listening for decades still have not received much perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Lord's recovery, all the gifts such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers should do the work of perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, they should all do the work of training.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They should be like the professors perfecting the students.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way, after a few years, the saints will be perfected and will be able to do the work that they do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At present, the publications among us are very rich and numerous.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are at least four thousand different messages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you would spend the time, these materials are very good to help you be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I heard that you have translated all the Life-study Messages of the New Testament into Korean.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you would spend two hours every day for two years to read these Life-study Messages, you will be equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In four years' time you will be able to finish all of these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time, you are in the church seeing how the apostles raise up churches, how they appoint elders, how they preach the high gospel, how they bring people into Christ to enjoy the riches of Christ, and how they determine doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, someone asked me this morning about the difference between the denominations and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a simple word, first, the denominations are denominated; they have divided the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is not denominated; it is one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the believers, whether they are sprinkled or immersed, are in the church as long as they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Second, the denominations do not have a definite ground.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church, however, has a definite ground which is also the unique ground.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here we stand on the ground of oneness in the different localities to worship God together and to build up the Body of Christ together.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I believe that after five years many of you will be able to be apostles, preaching the gospel from city to city and from village to village, establishing churches, releasing the truth, and building up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Next are the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The present atmosphere in the church meetings is that you are being trained to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, the sharings after a message are mostly repetitions of words that you just heard.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After speaking this way for a while, you will be able to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps the first time you stand up you are afraid to speak, and you are scared.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But as long as you keep practicing, your boldness will increase, and your voice will get stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Gradually you will not only be able to speak for the Lord, but you will also be able to speak forth the Lord and to speak the Lord into others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the meetings, people may not remember much about the messages they heard.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But they will feel that there is One following them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The reason for this is that you have spoken the Lord into them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After you return home, do not only chat with your family; instead you must learn to speak the Lord's word to your family, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way they will discover that you have changed, and they will also change through your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul said in 1 Corinthians 14 that you can all prophesy one by one v. 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The evangelists' perfecting of the saints makes every saint burdened with a spirit for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It cheers and warms up the gospel atmosphere for the saints that they would become burning to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In preaching the gospel it also helps them to speak to the point, not deviating from the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>While they speak, the listeners' hearts, mouths, and spirits will all be open and they will receive the Lord to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The shepherds and teachers' perfecting is like perfecting people to be mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many brothers and sisters cannot feed people after they have been brought to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They are like the mother who cannot nurse her child; thus the new ones do not receive much supply and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, we all have to be shepherds perfecting others, and we all have to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The more we do these things, the more we will improve, and the better we will become at doing them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the end, after this kind of perfecting, the saints will be able to be the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Every member will be able to function and will participate in the work of the New Testament ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this way we will no longer be babes tossed by waves and carried about by the winds of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The whole church will grow into a mature man with the stature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Seoul, Korea on November 7, 1988.</S>
