   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ARCHANGELS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The archangel 1 Thes 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse speaks of the archangel and shows that there is a hierarchy among the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are ordinary angels, and there are archangels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word archangel is singular in the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the Bible does not tell us, we do not know how many archangels there are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Michael the archangel Jude 9; see also Dan 10:13, 21; 12:1; Rev 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible refers to an archangel named Michael, which means Who is like God?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not know if the archangel in 1 Thessalonians 4 refers to Michael, but whenever the Bible mentions his name, it always speaks of his fighting or disputing with the devil or the devil s angels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, Michael must be the one who fights.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, the Bible clearly says that he is the great prince of Israel who protects the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He also disputed with the devil over the body of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that Michael is the protector of God s people and that he fights for God s people against the devil and his angels.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the hierarchy of the angels, Michael was lower than the former archangel, the devil, because Jude 9 indicates that he dared not rebuke the devil but let the Lord rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>GABRIEL</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The angel Gabriel Luke 1:26, see also v. 19; Dan 8:16; 9:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible also mentions an angel but never calls him an archangel named Gabriel, which means mighty man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every time the Bible mentions Gabriel, he is bringing news to the people of God, and the news he brings is good.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, he must be an angel who brings good news to the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>CHERUBIM</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>9:3; see also ch.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>10; 1:5-25; Gen 3:24; 1 Kings 6:23-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible also speaks of a group of God s angels called cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are especially close to God, and the glory of God is upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are also called the cherubim of glory Heb 9:5 ; therefore, they are a group of angels who are especially related to God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can say that they are a symbol of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They manifest God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>SERAPHIM</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Seraphim...saying: / Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts Isa 6:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible also speaks of another group of angels called seraphim, which means burning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Bible speaks of them, it particularly mentions God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are before God, crying to one another, Holy, holy, holy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, they are a group of angels especially related to God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They manifest God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The seraphim and the cherubim are two groups of angels before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The cherubim are related to God s glory, and the seraphim are related to God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the cherubim manifest God s glory, the seraphim manifest God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was the living creature that I had seen beneath the God of Israel...They were cherubim Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>10:20, see also v. 15; 1:5-25 .</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The four living creatures in Ezekiel are cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are especially related to God s glory, which is manifested upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings apiece, are full of eyes around and within; and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God the Almighty Rev 4:7-8; see also Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>1:10; 10:14; Isa 6:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Revelation there is reference to the living creatures, but there is a difference between this and what is spoken of them in Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Ezekiel mentions only cherubim, but Revelation mentions both cherubim and seraphim.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Revelation the four living creatures have not only the four faces of the cherubim but also the six wings of the seraphim; moreover, like the seraphim, they stand before God crying, Holy, holy, holy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that the four living creatures in Ezekiel are for God s glory, whereas the four living creatures in Revelation are for both God s glory and God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They have the cherubic function of glory and the seraphic function of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>SINFUL ANGELS</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God did not spare the angels who sinned but delivered them to gloomy pits, having cast them down to Tartarus, they being kept for judgment 2 Pet 2:4; see also Jude 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some of the angels sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They did not remain in their position but sinned and offended God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God s righteousness could not spare them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, God cast them into gloomy pits where they wait for judgment.</S>

   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His tail dragged away one-third of the stars of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The stars of heaven refer to the angels 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thus, this verse refers to the devil dragging away one-third of the angels in heaven.</S>
