<h2 class="head2">The Full-Timers Living a Life by Faith,<br />
Trusting in the Lord for Their Necessities,<br />
and Receiving the Lord&rsquo;s Supply<br />
through the Saints and the Churches</h2>
<p>The full-timers should live a life by faith, trusting in the Lord for their necessities and receiving the Lord&rsquo;s supply through the saints and the churches. If we feel led and burdened by the Lord to go full-time, we should not worry about our necessities. We have to believe in the Lord and put our trust in Him. We should not think that we will have a prosperous life in material things. We must get ourselves prepared to suffer. The first suffering is poverty. We need to learn to serve the Lord in poverty. Some think that if they serve the Lord in poverty, that is a sign they have not been chosen and called by the Lord. However, the apostle Paul was in poverty (2 Cor. 6:10; 11:27). Because the churches established by him did not adequately support him, he was forced to make tents (Acts 18:3). At the same time, he ministered to the needs of his co-workers (20:34).</p>
<p>When I was called by the Lord to serve Him full-time, I thought that He had just called me to preach the gospel to my countrymen in the villages. I told the Lord that as long as I could have water to drink and food to eat, I would be satisfied. I never thought the Lord would bring me to the big cities of mainland China and eventually to Taiwan and the United States. In 1961 I came to the United States with the intention of staying here for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. At that time I had just a little amount of cash on hand to meet my need. However, the Lord supplied me with enough for my necessities. The Lord is faithful to meet all our needs when we follow Him and His calling.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I have learned how to be abased in poverty and how to abound (Phil. 4:12). If we have the money, we should learn to save some for others and for the needs of the churches. To serve the Lord in this way is glorious. If the Lord has called us and sent us, He will surely take care of us. He has a way to supply us through the saints and the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not as Being Hired in Any Sense<br />
by Anyone or by Any Church</h2>
<p>When we serve the Lord, we should not have the thought that we are hired in any sense by anyone or by any church. If the church supplies us, that does not mean that the church hires us. That is not a wage but the Lord&rsquo;s supply through the church. We have to fully realize that the Lord in supporting us needs His Body (the church) and the members of His Body (the believers) to cooperate with Him. He does not supply us directly by Himself but indirectly through His Body and His members.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
AND MAINTAINING A GOOD ORDER<br />
IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We need to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ and maintain a good order in the Body of Christ so that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can be kept to go on in the proper way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Keeping the Unique Oneness of the Body of Christ<br />
Locally and Universally</h2>
<p>We should always endeavor to keep the unique oneness of the Body of Christ locally and universally (Eph. 4:1-6). This should be the prerequisite of our remaining in the recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Condemning Any Kind of Division</h2>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 1:10-13, we must condemn any kind of division.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Turning Away from Those Who Make Divisions</h2>
<p>We also must turn away from those who make divisions (Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10). This is why I published the book entitled <em>The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion.</em> Because some are sick, full of the germs of division, they need to be quarantined. This is according to Romans 16:17, where Paul charges us to turn away from those who make divisions. If we do not turn away from them, we will be infected with the same disease of division. To turn away from such ones is for our preservation. According to Titus 3:10, a factious, divisive person should be refused, rejected, after a first and second admonition in order to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
