   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Seeking Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first step of the divine sanctification by the Spirit is His seeking sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the Spirit's coming to seek out God's chosen people who became lost.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The seeking sanctification is fully unveiled in the second parable in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There the Spirit is likened to a woman seeking a lost coin by lighting a lamp and sweeping the house v. 8 . She sought this lost coin finely.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, she found it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, the lost coin was the prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Due to the Spirit's seeking and finding, the prodigal son woke up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He came to himself v. 17 . He made the decision to rise up and go back to his father to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John 16 goes on to show that this seeking Spirit is also the convicting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He convicts all the lost sinners of sin in Adam, of righteousness in Christ, and of the judgment for Satan vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man's full repentance is the result of the work of the seeking and convicting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Peter 1:2 tells us that this seeking and convicting of the Spirit is the sanctification of the Spirit before the sprinkling of the blood upon the repentant sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that the seeking sanctification was before our repentance and believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, our repentance and believing were due to the seeking Spirit, the convicting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We were lost in sin and among a heap of sinners, but the seeking Spirit came to seek us out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result we woke up, repented, returned to God, and asked Him to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was the result of our Father's choosing with His predestinating in eternity past along with His Spirit's coming in time to seek us out and convict us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This seeking, this convicting, is the seeking sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Regenerating Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the juncture we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, the same Spirit, the seeking Spirit, sanctified us further by regenerating us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We were born of the Spirit John 3:5 and God as the Spirit came into our spirit Rom 8:16; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we are the sons of God, the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The seeking Spirit woke us up and brought us back to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We repented and believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We received Christ, and the Spirit sanctified us further, making us the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the second step of the divine sanctification, the regenerating sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Father put Christ's redeeming blood upon us, just like the loving father put the best robe upon the returned prodigal son Luke 15:22; Heb 13:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Also, the sanctifying Spirit entered into our spirit with God's life to make us children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we have the blood of Christ without and the life of God within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All our offenses have been forgiven through the blood, the redemption of Christ, and our spirit has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit's regenerating sanctification transpired in our spirit John 3:6 .</S>
