   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE THE FLESH AND THE WORK OF GOD Date: October 17, 1936, morning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Amoy THREE GREAT ENEMIES OF GOD'S PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the history of the Israelites, God's people had three main enemies: the Egyptians, the Philistines, and the Amalekites.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The world is signified by Egypt; the power of darkness, who is Satan, is signified by the Philistines; and the flesh is signified by the Amalekites.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Triune God has a triune enemy who frustrates His people from following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Outside of God's people, there is the world, under them there is Satan, and within them there is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These three enemies work together to frustrate God's work among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Egypt typifies the world that binds us; it signifies the worldly living and everything that occupies us and causes us not to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Philistines typify the authority of darkness, the power of Satan, which frustrates us and disturbs us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Amalekites typify our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Outwardly speaking, the Amalekites were not as menacing as the Egyptians and the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They opposed the Israelites who had left Egypt and would not allow them to enter Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Amalekites cooperated with the Egyptians and the Philistines to stop the Israelites from entering Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This typifies the work of the flesh in us, frustrating us from fully entering into the heavenly position to enjoy God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These are the three most damaging enemies that attack our Christian life on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, the world takes away our love of the Father 1 John 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The world is versus the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, Satan causes us to rebel against Christ's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First John 3:8 says that the Son of God was manifested for the purpose of destroying the works of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, Satan is versus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Third, the flesh lusts against the Spirit within us Gal 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, the flesh is versus the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can see that the triune enemy is versus our Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The world is versus the Father, Satan is versus Christ, and the flesh is versus the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The trouble today is that many Christians love the world and are bound by the world; they do not want to leave Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are also Christians who do not realize their heavenly position, which is their Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They have never heard of the ascended place of Christ nor experienced it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus they are blocked from entering Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Victory over the world is the initial stage of the Christian life, while the heavenly position in Christ signifies the highest peak of the Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This morning we will not speak about the world or Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our emphasis will be on the problem of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The flesh is manifested not only in our personal lives, but many times in God's work as well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If it were only manifested in our personal lives, the matter would not be that serious.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when it is manifested in God's work, the glory of God will suffer great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>WHAT IS THE FLESH?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How does the flesh manifest itself in the work of God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, we must know what the flesh is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once we know what the flesh is, we will know how it is manifested in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can know what the flesh is from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Simply put, everything that originates from the natural life is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The flesh is what we have acquired from our natural life; it is what we have inherited and what we possess from birth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Anything that does not come as a result of our regeneration is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It does not matter how much and what kind it is, as long as it does not originate from our regeneration, it is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How do we know this?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The answer is in John 3:6.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank God that everyone who is sitting here today has had these two births already.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We were all born of the flesh, and we have all been born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These two births often occur twenty to fifty years apart.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That which is born of the flesh means that which we received when we came out of our mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That which is born of the Spirit means that which we received when we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is a time difference between these two occurrences.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The birth of the flesh happens first, and the birth of the Spirit happens later.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus said, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A regenerated person inherits every spiritual thing that can be inherited at the time of his regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only after the Spirit begets the spirit are there spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do you want to know what is of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not difficult to know this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All you have to do is to find out what you have received since your regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then you will know what is of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you set aside all the new things you received from the Spirit's regeneration, the flesh would be all that was left.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What does the flesh include?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It includes everything that is in the natural realm and everything that you had originally.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are two aspects to the flesh, one is filthy and the other is clean.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One is sinful and the other good.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before a man is regenerated, not only does he commit sins, but he commits "goodness" as well.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many non-Christians have good works, but according to God, these good works are not of the Holy Spirit, because they are not born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God wants to remove not only all of man's sins, but all of his goodness as well.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Anything that is not from the Spirit, whether good or bad, is rejected by God and must be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God only wants that which comes from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He does not ask if something is good or evil; He only asks if such a thing is from the Spirit or the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He does not ask about the nature of a thing; He only asks where it comes from.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Anything that comes from the flesh is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is easy for man to see the evil and sinful part of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But it is difficult to discern the good part of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must therefore pay particular attention to the good part of the flesh.</S>
