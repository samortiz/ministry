<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REASON THE LORD<br>WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 21</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 4:13-14; 2:23-24; 6:15; 7:3-4, 6, 9; 12:24; 13:37-38; 16:31-33</H1><P>Our Lord did everything well when He was on earth. There is one verse in Mark that says that He has done all things well (Mark 7:37). Indeed, everything He did was done well. Today we will speak on what the Lord has done. At the same time we will pay particular attention to the words of John 4:13 and 14.</P><P>These are the words of the Lord Jesus Himself. He tells us how He will fill the heart of a Christian and quench all his unquenchable desires. This is the Lord's own promise to us: "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever." Whoever drinks of the water that the Lord gives will be quenched of his desires forever; he will never feel that he is lacking in something and will never be disappointed. Our next question is, can this be possible? Yes, it is possible that those who have received the Lord Jesus will never thirst again. But why are some people still not satisfied? Some have said that they are still thirsty, that they still have not received what they want, and that there is still something they are after. Does this mean that the Lord's promise is not fulfilled? No, it does not because the Lord says that whoever drinks of the water He gives will by no means thirst forever. The Lord satisfies forever.</P><P>Why then are we still thirsty? Why then are we not satisfied and still filled with desires? Why are there still sorrows, worries, demands, and self-pity? The reason is that we only see the promise of verse 14 but have forgotten the declaration of verse 13. The Lord not only says, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever," He also says before this that "everyone who drinks of this water [the world's water, the water left by Jacob, which is the best water in the world] shall thirst again."</P><P>Many people do not understand the nature of the water of this world. They do not understand the nature of the things that the world can give to them, whether they last, and how long they last. They cannot tell, first of all, the difference between the temporary and the eternal, the seen and the unseen, the physical and the spiritual. This is why they do not understand that to have the promise of the Lord in verse 14, in which He promises to satisfy their hearts, there must first be the realization of verse 13 which says that the water of this world cannot satisfy their hearts. We must first know that "everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again" before we understand the Lord's word, "by no means thirst forever." The Lord wants us to be satisfied; He does not want us to take one thing and hope for another over and over again and never find ourselves satisfied.</P><P>Today I am not speaking about the world's water and how it cannot satisfy man's heart. I am here to explain why Christians feel thirsty in this world. Why are Christians thirsty? The reason we are thirsty is because we turn back to drink the water of verse 13. Why do we become disappointed? If there is no hope, there will be no disappointment. If there was never a hope, there would never be a disappointment. If we never hope to have money, we will never be disappointed by the lack of money. In the same way, if we hope that the water of this world can satisfy us, our eyes will be turned in the wrong direction, and we will feel thirsty. This is the reason we become heartbroken, uneasy, and disappointed. Why is it that we cannot be satisfied? We want to satisfy our desires with the things that are soon passing away. If we want transient things, transient fame and fortune, we will never be satisfied. Once these things fall into our hands, we will find that they do not gratify us; they will not make us happy or satisfied. We feel that we have more desires; we want more things. We are thirsty again and have to drink again. Our mistake lies in the fact that we try to satisfy ourselves with transient things. If our hands are holding onto these transient things and our hearts are set on these transient things, we will never be satisfied in our hearts.</P><P>Today I will speak about the Lord's own words exclusively from the Gospel of John. In addition to the Gospel of John, the other three Gospels record many of the Lord's words. Our Lord was never discouraged. What He experienced and encountered in His environment during His lifetime should have given Him much discouragement and disappointment. But He was not discouraged or disappointed. Isaiah 49 says something concerning the Lord. It says that God intends for Christ to bring Jacob back again to Him and gather Israel back again to Himself. But outwardly everything seemed to have failed completely. How did He feel? It says, "I have labored in vain; / I have used up my strength for nothing and vanity; / Yet surely the justice due to me is with Jehovah, / And my recompense with my God" (v. 4). He was not disappointed. Isaiah 42 also says that the Lord did not faint and was not discouraged. Although what He encountered could have caused Him to faint and be discouraged, He did not behave that way.</P><P>The emphasis of the Gospel of John is different from that of the Gospel of Matthew. The Lord in the Gospel of John was rejected by men from the beginning. The Lord in the Gospel of Matthew was not rejected until after chapter twelve. John 1 records that the Lord came to His own, and His own received Him not. He came to bear the sins of the people of Israel and the Gentiles. Yet men did not want Him; they rejected Him and would not receive Him. When He was on the cross, men rejected Him, and God also rejected Him. We would have been disappointed, discouraged, saddened, and grieved. But John 19 records that the Lord cried on the cross, "It is finished!" We would have cried, "It is over!" But He was shouting like a victorious army, "It is finished!" Throughout His life, He took satisfaction in God. He had no hope toward the world and did not expect to receive anything from it. His only hope was in God, and His only satisfaction was in God. He said that no one knows the Son except the Father, that He did not receive glory from men, that He did not come to do His own will but the will of the One who sent Him, and that He always did the will of the One who sent Him. Our Lord had God's will as His satisfaction all His life. He was satisfied only with God. This is why He was not disappointed no matter how people, events, and things in this world changed. Those who take their satisfaction in God will never be disappointed.</P>
