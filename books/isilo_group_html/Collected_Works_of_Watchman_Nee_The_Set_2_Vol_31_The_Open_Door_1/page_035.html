While Wenchow and Ping-Yang are still quiet, it is hard to tell what changes the future will bring. The brothers and sisters are living peacefully day by day through relying on the Lord's grace; they are not frightened. However, some brothers are having difficulties with their living, because business and industry have stopped. Praise and thank the Lord that in this difficult time the gospel work has an open door in every place, even though all occupations have stopped. In the last two weeks we few co-workers in the Bai-Sha region of Jiang-Nan held seven gospel meetings (during the night). Sometimes we borrowed someone's house, and sometimes we held the meetings in the open air. The number of attendants was more than one hundred every time. Sometimes it exceeded three or four hundred. The degree of concentration and attention among the attendants was unprecedented. We deeply believe that we will soon see some children of God raised up in this audience. Today we will begin to have several weeks of continuous gospel work in the area around Hu-Shan and in the region of Chao-Yang-Shan. (We made this decision in our prayer long ago.) At the beginning of this work, we really felt weak and did not know how to begin. We can only look to God with fear and trembling for His timely grace. Please do not forget to pray for this. Brother Chai Chi is often physically weak. Please pray for him. May the grace and peace of the Father be with you always. Greet Brother Watchman Nee, Brother Lan Tsi-yi, and all the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Ching-fa<br />November 30, 1937<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Two Letters from Brother Han Fu-sheng</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother Tsi-yi:</p><p>We left Hankow on the sixteenth of last month and arrived at Lin-Tze-Kou after three days. The boat of the T'ai Ku company could not proceed because the water was too shallow, so they hired a local boat to take us to Yuan-Jiang. Yuan-Jiang usually has a small steamer that goes to Ch'ang-Teh, but it has not been selling tickets recently, and we heard of robberies along the way. We stayed in an inn for two days. Later, a Western missionary, a Chinese pastor, and a preacher of the Methodist Church warmly welcomed us and allowed us to move into their meeting hall. Their attitude toward us was very open, and they invited us to preach a few times. There were many who had a desire. I came to Yi-Yang by car a few days ago and waited for two days in Yi-Yang for a bus. I received Brother Sun Bao-chai's letter and learned that this road was difficult and with bandits, so it was not the right time to go forward. I could not go by water either, because the water level was too low. We decided to stay in Ch'ang-Teh temporarily. Dr. Qu went to Yuan-Jiang yesterday. It is hard to say whether he will hire a local boat or take the steamer. Brother Feng is doing his best to help us and has already found three places to stay&mdash;one in Brother Chu Teh-hsin's home, one in Mr. Chao's home (the responsible one in the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church), and one in Brother Feng's home. The area around Ch'ang-Teh is still peaceful, and the cost of living is very low. One measure of the best rice is six dollars. If Ch'ang-sha is not affected by the crisis, we can stay here for a long time. If the situation becomes tense, we are prepared to retreat to Chen-Jou. Brother Loh Yung-dien, who used to teach in Sui-Jou Secondary School in Jia-Shing, has escaped here to Ch'ang-Teh with seven poor, homeless students. Brother Lo married Miss Ma Ru-xun on the twenty-seventh of last month. When the seven students started out, there were a few who were not saved, but while they were fleeing, they all saw their sins and repented, believing in the Lord. They also received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Presently, we need a place to preach the gospel in Ch'ang-Teh. May the Lord open for us a door for the gospel here. We ask you brothers to be our backup in prayer. Peace and well-being in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Fu-sheng<br />January 3</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 35</div><br></body></html>
