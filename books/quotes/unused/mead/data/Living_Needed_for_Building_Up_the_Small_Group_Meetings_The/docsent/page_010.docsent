   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LIVING THAT IS SATURATED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WHOSE CONSTITUENT IS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you study thoroughly verses 12 and 13, you will see that the functioning of all the members of the Body of Christ is nothing but a living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And this living is composed of two kinds of elements.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One is the Spirit, who is like water; the other is Christ, who is like food.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The growth of the human life depends on these two elements.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Food is solid, and water is liquid.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Within these two elements are many rich nutrients.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The nutrition in food is greater than the nutrition in water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, food is dry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When it gets into you, without water to dissolve it, it is difficult for the nutrition in the food to saturate your cells and blood stream.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need the solid food, and we also need the liquid water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The food is Christ, and the water is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My body can stand upright because it is sustained by food and water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All of us grow and live by the supply of food and water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They sustain our work and activities.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For our physical being to grow up healthily, we need to eat rich food and drink nutritious drinks.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Chinese who are born in America are all tall and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is because the American food is exceedingly rich.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>American milk, American steak, American chicken, American fruits, and many other kinds of American food are eaten and constituted into their being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, they are constituted with American food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if they do not eat the riches of American food, then naturally they will be small, skinny, and unhealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today many Christians are small, skinny, and bony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is because they have not been eating Christ and drinking the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ and the Spirit are the two necessary constituents for the growth in life of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are also the foundation of the service of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE PROBLEMS OF THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this message we are considering the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have no desire to gather the brothers and sisters together merely to have one person speak while all the rest listen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We desire to see all the saints functioning in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if we have a few hundred or a few thousand people meeting together, how could it be possible for everyone to function?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is for this reason that the Bible mentions both the big meetings in the temple and the small meetings from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is where our difficulty lies.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose you have begun to meet in your home, and you have seven or eight people meeting together as a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first two meetings may be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But by the third time you run out of content; there is no more supply.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One brother may say, I am going home and another may say, I am leaving.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the end you find that you cannot carry on such meetings any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This situation may be likened to a group of children growing up in America who refuse to eat hamburger or drink milk.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do not want to eat anything or drink anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you put five of them on a team and ask them to play ball, of course they will not have the strength to play.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The reason that our small group meetings are not attractive is that we are all dry and skinny, weak and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not act like living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In such a condition it is all right for us to come to attend a service or to sit in a pew.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There we may have a few who can sing professionally and who can lead us in singing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may also have a few who are trained in praying who can lead us in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Of course, there is also the preacher who will preach to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is easy to attend a service in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, if six or seven of us are put together by ourselves, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Who will pray for us?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Who will preach to us?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In such a situation we may look at each other, or just talk to each other about many irrelevant things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the end there is nothing more to say, and the meeting cannot be carried on any further.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For this reason, we cannot talk about propagation or increase.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can only remain where we are, get by with what we have, and overlook our real needs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is why my whole being is overloaded with this heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>My hope is that in every local church we would see a total mobilization of all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In order to have a total mobilization, there is no other way but to have the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only in the small groups will everyone be able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>CHRIST IN THE SPIRIT AS MAN S SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must have a kind of living that is initiated from the Holy Spirit and which passes through the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In other words, we must have a living in which we walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, that is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Tonight the Lord has shown us the constituents of this kind of living.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The first constituent is food; the second is water.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The food is Christ, and the water is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>According to the Bible, Christ is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is like all the nutrition in the food being in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From Revelation 22 we can see that the tree of life grows in the river of life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Wherever the river of life flows, there the tree of life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The fruit of the tree of life comes out of the two sides of the river to supply man s need.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ must be in the Spirit before He can be our supply.</S>
