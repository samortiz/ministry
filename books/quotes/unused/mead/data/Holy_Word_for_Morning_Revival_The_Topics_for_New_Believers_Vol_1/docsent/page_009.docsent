   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 2 DAY 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Gen 1:27 And God created man in His own image</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Job 32:8 But there is a spirit in man</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Mingled Spirit God Created Man in His Image as a Vessel to Contain Him</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first crucial and striking point concerning God's creation of man is that God created man in His image and according to His likeness Gen 1:26a .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>40 Who is God's image?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible tells us that Christ is the image of God 2 Cor 4:4b; Col 1:15 41 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 9:21 tells us that God created us and chose us that we might be vessels to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, we were not only created according to the image of Christ, but we were also created as vessels instead of instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God did not create us as instruments to work for Him; instead, He created us as vessels to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>42 God Created Man with a Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second striking point in the creation of man is that God created man with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 2:7 says that God formed man of the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No doubt this refers to man's body as the framework of man's being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After God formed a body for man, God breathed the breath of life into man's nostrils.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Dust does not have any life, but the breath of God has life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Genesis 2:7 the word for breath in Hebrew is neshamah.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is used also in Proverbs 20:27, which says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that the very breath of life breathed into man's body became man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is confirmed by Job 32:8, which says, "But there is a spirit in man, / And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this verse a spirit in man and the breath of the Almighty are in apposition, indicating that the spirit of man and the breath of God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The spirit of man is the breath of God, and the breath of God is man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>43 Furthermore , man's body and man's spirit came together to produce a living soul Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A human being is a soul with two organs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The outward organ is the body; the inward organ is our spirit, which is the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 we are told that a whole man is composed of spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>44</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The tripartite man was created with a spirit to be the receiver and container of the divine life Gen 2:7; Prov 20:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>45 A radio has a receiver within it so that it can receive, contain, and express the radio waves from the air.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The outward box of the radio is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It needs an inner recipient, an inner receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Within us there is also a receiver, and this receiver is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Zechariah 12:1. ranks the spirit of man with the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It says that the Lord is the One who stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows that only these three things are important and vital in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here you have the purpose of the universe, the meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The heavens with all the stars and planets are for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The earth is not for the heavens but for man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without the earth, man could not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The earth is just right for us to live to fulfill our purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man is not for education, for clothing, for food, for housing, or for entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Man is good only for God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man is a God-bottle, a vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As God-bottles, we need a God-receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since God is Spirit, we need a spirit to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only our spirit can receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only our spirit can touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only our spirit can contain the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>46</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we did not have a spirit we would become meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Also, if there were no God in the universe, the whole universe would become empty.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without God being the Spirit and without us having a spirit to contact God, to contain God , to be one with God, the whole universe is empty and we are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By this we can see the importance of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>47</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
