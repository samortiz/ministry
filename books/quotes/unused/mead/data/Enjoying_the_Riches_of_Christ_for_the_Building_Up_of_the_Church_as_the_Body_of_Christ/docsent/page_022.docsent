   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING THE CHILDREN'S BREAD AND THE CRUMBS UNDER THE TABLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We can do nothing without eating.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today we simply need to eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is our life in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ came to present Himself as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day a Canaanite woman came to Him, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David!"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus answered, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs" Matt 15:22, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The woman called the Lord Jesus the Son of David, a descendant of the royal family, but the Lord Jesus in His answer indicated that He was bread for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord seemed to say, "Don't consider that I am the royal descendant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have come here as bread to you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am the bread to the children.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Consider Me in this way."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The woman was clever and immediately took her position.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She said, "Yes, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You are right.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You are the bread to the children, and I am a Gentile dog.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet even the dogs have their portion the crumbs under the table.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You, Jesus, are now under the table.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You have been thrown off the table by the naughty Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now it is my turn.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You are on the Gentile floor as crumbs to be my portion."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The natural, human, and religious concepts are that Jesus is the Son of David, of the royal family, even the King.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The divine concept, however, is that Jesus as the very God has come to be our life in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we must eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>KNOWLEDGE AND GIFTS DISTRACTING THE BELIEVERS FROM CHRIST AS THEIR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jesus died on the cross, and in resurrection He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit, as 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul points out that the Corinthian believers' need was not gifts or knowledge but the life-giving Spirit and the eating of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Corinthian believers made the mistake of taking knowledge and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Corinthians 1:7 says, "So that you do not lack in any gift, eagerly awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Corinthians did not lack in any gift.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They had all the gifts, and they had all knowledge, but they were not matured saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Chapter three says, "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ" v. 1 . The Corinthians had knowledge, but they were still infants.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 8:1 Paul said, "Knowledge puffs up."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Knowledge kills us because knowledge is something of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not something of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Corinthians held the concept that they needed knowledge and gifts, but according to Paul they were still infants.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The apostle Paul's concept was that they needed to eat Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 10:3 and 4 Paul says, "And all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In chapter three Paul said, "I gave you milk to drink" v. 2 . The Corinthians wrongly took knowledge and the gifts, so Paul adjusted them by telling them that their need was Christ as their food.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The last Adam became the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They needed to take in this Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church has missed the mark, not only today in this century but even in the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Corinthians missed the mark by turning aside from the eating of Jesus to knowledge and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result, the church became degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The degradation of the church came from emphasizing teachings, knowledge, and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>BEING RECOVERED FROM TEACHINGS AND DOCTRINES TO THE EATING OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the seven epistles in Revelation, the Lord Jesus spoke to the churches concerning teachings and works 2:2, 6, 14-15, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He seemed to be saying, "You have the teaching of Balaam, you have the teaching of the Nicolaitans, and you are taught by the woman Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You also have done many things for Me. You have knowledge, you have the doctrines, you have teachings, and you have all the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, you have missed eating Me."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In these seven epistles, the Lord Jesus promised the overcomers that they would eat.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He did not promise them to know, to do, or to work, but to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Are you recovered?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today many of us talk much about the recovery, but I must check with you: What is the Lord's recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The recovery is to bring us back to the origin, back to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What was in the beginning, at the origin?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There was the eating of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May the Lord be merciful to us that our eyes would be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May we see today that we need the eating of Jesus as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we need to overcome not only our temper, today's fashions, or the pursuit of a doctor's degree.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to overcome all the degraded teachings of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I myself was born and raised in fundamental Christianity, and I was with the Plymouth Brethren for seven and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They are very strict and famous for their teaching, and I received much knowledge from them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It took fifteen years to unload all the distracting knowledge I received from them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today many dear hungry and seeking Christians are distracted and led away by all the teachings from the enjoyment and eating of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now the Lord is recovering us and bringing us back from all the teachings in today's degraded Christianity to the pure eating of Jesus.</S>
