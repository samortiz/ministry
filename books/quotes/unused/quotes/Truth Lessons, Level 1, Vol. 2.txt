In this lesson we will continue the previous lesson to see the prophets and other related people during the return
Besides these, there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven servants and maids, and two hundred singing men and women
Joshua , the son of Josedech, served as the high priest taking care of the matters pertaining to the worship of God
They built and set the altar of God upon its original foundation, they offered sacrifices to God, and they kept the feast of tabernacles
The prophets Haggai and Zechariah prophesied in the name of God and spoke words of encouragement to the people in Judah and Jerusalem
The enemy's opposition and hindrance steadily increased, and desolation and drought continued to plague the land
The word of God came to Haggai the prophet, saying, 'Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house lie waste?
God spoke through Haggai the prophet to encourage the people to be strong and work for the completion of the rebuilding of God's house
As Iddo was one among the first group of priests who returned to Israel , Zechariah was both a prophet and a priest
The first vision was of a man riding upon a red horse and standing among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom
The angel stood in the bottom, where God's people were kept in captivity, staying with them and interceding for their return
A measuring line is for measuring the land, signifying that God would measure and choose Jerusalem and dwell in its midst
The initial fulfillment of these prophecies took place during the time of Zechariah, but their complete fulfillment is yet to come
He will come a second time, accompanied by His saints , and His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives which is outside of Jerusalem
He will fight for the children of Israel, His chosen people, against the nations that besieged them and will save them from destruction
At that time the whole house of Israel will look upon Him whom they have pierced and they will mourn for Him thus all Israel will be saved
In the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes I, Ezra obtained permission from the king to lead the people of Israel up to Jerusalem
The people, under Nehemiah's leadership, rebuilt the walls with one hand doing the work and the other hand holding a weapon
Although he was the governor, Nehemiah had not eaten the bread of the governor that he might not increase the burden of the people
At that time, Ezra joined in to recover the things pertaining to the worship of God contained in the book of the law
Malachi was the most hidden among the prophets, because aside from his name, there is no record of his status or genealogy
When Nehemiah came back he unexpectedly cast all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber of Gods house and thus cleansed the temple
Malachi rebuked and admonished the people of Israel for their evils after the rebuilding of the holy temple and the holy city
He rebuked the priests for despising the name of God and for offering polluted bread upon the altar , thus departing out of the way
Rather, He will be as the rising sun, and the world will behold His glory; moreover, He will heal the remnant of the people of Israel
During the time of Nehemiah and Ezra the scribe, there was Malachi the prophet speaking for God and instructing the people
According to the Bible, the main function of a prophet is not to predict the things to come but to speak for God
In the whole Bible, to prophesy is mainly to speak for God and to speak forth God; sometimes it is also to predict
The prophets before the age of the prophets were Abraham, Moses, Samuel, David, and the Gentile prophet Balaam
During those forty years, Moses served as God's spokesman, speaking for God, speaking forth God, and predicting
Samuel 3:19-21 says, 'And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground
God prophesied through him that the house of Eli would deteriorate and that a man after God's heart would succeed Saul to the throne
He loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore, God anointed Him with the oil of exultant joy above His partners
After resurrection, He declares the Father's name to His brothers ; in the midst of the church He sings praise to the Father
Balaam was a prophet from Pethor, which was by the river, who was hired by Balak, the king of the Moabites, to curse the children of Israel
He also predicted that Christ would come as a Star out of Jacob and as a Scepter rising out of Israel, and that He would have dominion
When the tabernacle was set up at Mount Sinai, Aaron and his two sons were anointed and consecrated for the priestly service
When David killed Uriah, took his wife, and thus sinned against God, God sent the prophet Nathan to rebuke him for his evil deed
When the priests failed and the kings were ruined, the prophets were then raised up as a support to the priests and kings
When David was fleeing and wandering, the prophet Gad advised him not to abide in the stronghold but to go into the land of Judah
David built there an altar unto God and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings; thus the plague was stayed from Israel
When David begot Solomon through Bathsheba, God sent word through Nathan and named Solomon 'Jedidiah' , because God loved him
When David was old and stricken in years, Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself and plotted to usurp the throne
Nathan and Bathsheba devised a plan which caused David to swear that Solomon would be the king and thus foiled the scheme of Adonijah
He had already lost fellowship with God, yet he made false claims saying that an angel had spoken to him by the word of Jehovah
During the time when King Ahab and the people were worshipping Baal, Elijah was a strong witness of God and a man of prayer as well
On Mount Carmel, he proved that Jehovah was God and Baal was a false god; he also destroyed the prophets of Baal
His prophetic ministry lasted the longest; he prophesied under the reigns of four kings: Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah
Hebrews 2:13b shows that he and the children whom God gave to him typify Christ and the believers whom God gave to Him
The book of Isaiah speaks concerning salvation in such great detail that some have even called it the Gospel of Isaiah
People despised and rejected Jeremiah regarding him not as a priest much less a prophet they treated him like a criminal and like a traitor
The dream and the writing which he interpreted before the king and the prophecies in his book also testify that God is the supreme Judge
The prophecies in the book of Hosea were filled with salvation, especially Jehovah's salvation for the backsliding Israel
Based upon the contents of the book of Joel, we can conclude that among the prophets who wrote books, Joel was one of the earliest
He prophesied that the Holy Spirit would be poured out at Pentecost and that those who would call upon the Lord's name would be saved
He chose a herdsman to be His prophet to warn Jeroboam, the son of Joash and the king of Israel, in the days of his great prosperity
Jonah means 'a dove,' signifying that God's commission to Jonah was to fly out like a dove to preach the gospel of peace
In his book he pointed out repeatedly the transcendence and incomparableness of God's holiness, righteousness, love, and mercy
God gave him the vision specifically concerning the Assyrian Empire and the destruction of its capital Nineveh
Toward the oppressed people, God comforted them through the prophets; toward the cruel and violent Assyria, God made revenge
At that time Assyria was the strongest nation and the most cruel aggressor, and all the Near Eastern nations were afraid of her
The book of Habakkuk is very similar to the book of Nahum, both being concerned with God's judgment upon the enemies of God's people
Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah , was a prince in the royal house of Judah
During his reign Josiah began to remove the idols but did not do it thoroughly; thus, some idols still remained
Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo , was born in the land of captivity; he returned to the homeland with Zerubbabel
Iddo was one among the first group of priests to return ; hence, Zechariah was both a prophet and a priest , like Jeremiah and Ezekiel
Bible readers can see, however, that a wonderful connection and correspondence definitely exist between the two books
The things that were mentioned at the end of Malachi are also at the beginning of Matthew-the Messenger of the covenant and His forerunner
God's original intention was to have the whole house of Israel be a kingdom of priests, to have every one of them serving God as a priest
When the priestly office of the house of Aaron deteriorated, God raised up the kingship, and thus the age of the kings began
The Lord Jesus said All the things must be fulfilled which have been written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me
After they returned to their own country, they were under the rule of the Persian Empire for another two centuries
When he drew near to the holy city, the high priest Jaddua led a company of priests and Levites to welcome him
Located between Syria and Egypt, the land of Judea once again became a point of contention between the two powers
Under the rule of Ptolemy and his successors, the Jews in both Egypt and Judea gained considerable religious freedom and protection
He further pledged the land of Palestine as a dowry, promising an equal share in the tax revenues from the land for the two countries
The Jews, who had managed to survive under foreign domination, now had a much more difficult time under the two co-rulers
, the decisive encounter known as the Battle of Magnesia took place between Antiochus the Great and the Roman army
He was forced to concede territory as payment to Rome, and his son Antiochus was given as a hostage to the Romans
What the little horn did in Daniel 8:9-14 and what the king from the north performed in 11:21-32a both refer to the same thing
The great image in chapter two is of four parts: the head, the breast and the arms, the belly and the thighs, and the legs
Pember, in his writings on the prophecies, says that signs of a ram could be found everywhere in Persia, especially in its capital
Antiochus Epiphanes was the son of Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, and the younger brother of Seleucus Philopator
When his brother was murdered by Heliodorus, Epiphanes, with the help of the king of Pergamum, killed Heliodorus and regained power
Instead of returning to Rome as a hostage and thereby relieving Demetrius to become king, he claimed the throne for himself
After Antiochus Epiphanes obtained the kingdom, he entered into war with the Egyptians, regained Judea, and mistreated the Jews severely
, returning from his expedition to Egypt, he entered Jerusalem and allowed his soldiers to carry on a three day massacre
The surprise intervention of Rome forced him to evacuate, as depicted in Daniel 11:30, where it says, 'He shall be grieved, and return'
Disappointed, he turned his indignation toward the holy people, who were to experience a much greater persecution than before
Sacrifices, circumcision, and keeping of the Sabbath were absolutely forbidden, and violators received capital punishment
It was he who took away the daily sacrifice, cast down the sanctuary, trod on the holy people, and attacked the true God
At that time, confronted with such unprecedented calamity, God's people called upon Him night and day for deliverance
As he finished speaking, a Jew was about to make an offering at the altar according to the king's decree before the rest of the people
Following this, the old man and his sons dashed recklessly toward the commissioner and his aids, killing all of them
While destroying the heathen altar he cried, 'Let everyone who is zealous for the law and supports the covenant come out with me'!
He then organized a kind of guerrilla force to attack the Syrian troops everywhere, burning the idols and doing away with traitors
Before his death he repeatedly charged his sons to continue his resolve to be zealous for Gods law and to die for their ancestors covenant
He loved God and his own country, leading a company of people and fighters who were faithful to God's law to resist foreign invasion
Renowned Syrian generals such as Apollonius, Lysias, Gorgias, and Nicanor, with troops many times more than the Jews, were defeated by him
His famous proverb was, 'It is not on the size of the army that victory in battle depends, but strength comes from heaven'
, he won three major battles known in history as the Battle of Beth-Horon, the Battle of Emmaus, and the Battle of Beth-Zur
, the people rose up early to offer sacrifices to God on the rebuilt altar according to the ancient ordinances
That particular day was selected to sanctify the altar because it was on the very same day and month when the Gentiles first defiled it
They rejoiced for eight straight days, and that period became the origin of 'the feast of Dedication' of the Jews
, two years after the cleansing of the temple, Antiochus finally succumbed in a foreign land, thus concluding a sinful life
Besides defeating Syria Judas Maccabaeus also conquered the Edomites the Philistines and the Amorites and recovered many lost territories
After Judas Maccabaeus died, his brothers Jonathan and Simon continued successively to fight for the Israelites
, when the great Roman general Pompey overran Jerusalem, Antipater immediately changed with the wind and subjected himself to Rome
Because he served the Romans unequivocally under all circumstances, he was highly regarded by the Roman government
At the age of eighteen, when he was studying in Greece, Octavian was advised by friends and relatives to flee eastward for his life
Judea, being situated between Syria to the north and Egypt to the south, was often caught in the wars between the two powers
When Antiochus Epiphanes became king of Syria, he occupied the holy land, slaughtered the Israelites, and defiled the temple
The Maccabees, led by Judas Maccabaeus, later rose up to defeat and expel the Syrians, and the temple was cleansed as a result
Today the covenant is no longer merely a covenant but a testament bequeathed by the One who enacted the covenant
Two thousand years later, God sent His Son Jesus Christ to the world, who shed His blood on the cross and enacted the new covenant
Strictly speaking, the old covenant does not cover the entire period of the Old Testament, from Genesis to Malachi
God was speaking words of grace to the children of Israel, telling them that what He had done to them was a matter of grace
In the beginning God dealt with them according to grace; like an eagle with her young, He was very pleasant and approachable
Since the old covenant was something added and was not God's original intention for man, it could not remain permanently
Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God's righteousness that by it the covenant may be enacted
Galatians 3:21 says, 'If a law was given which was able to give life, righteousness would have indeed been of the law'
The prophecy in Jeremiah 31:31-34 concerning the coming new covenant indicated that the first covenant had become old and decrepit
It might have been that Jeremiah realized the weakness and unprofitableness of the old covenant and was deeply burdened about this matter
Unlike the old covenant, which became old and decrepit and was abolished , the new covenant is eternally effective
When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross and shed the precious blood, He made the way for God to enact a new covenant with us
Because His blood satisfied the requirement of God's righteousness, it opened the way for God to enact a new covenant with us
Grace is the Triune God processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to become everything to us
The new covenant does not require man to keep the law; rather, it deals with man according to grace, which is God as everything to man
The New Testament shows us very clearly that God does not require man to work; God requires man only to believe
As far as the Israelites are concerned, the prophecy in Jeremiah 31 will not be fulfilled until Christ's second coming
Because all the commandments, statutes, and ordinances of the Old Testament are recorded in these five books, they are called the Law
The fifth is the book of Acts, which is a record of the movement of the apostles on the earth after the Lord's resurrection and ascension
They tell us in particular concerning the church in God's eternal plan as well as the different aspects of the church
There is only one book of prophecy, the book of Revelation, the last book of the New Testament as well as the last book of the Bible
The Old Testament refers to the first section, and it contains thirty-nine books which can be divided into four categories
In this lesson we will begin with John the Baptist, since he was the inaugurator who brought in the New Testament age
The Jews took God's law and the service of the tabernacle instituted by God and made them into dead ordinances
He was an Israelite born into a tribe of serving priests, which was the tribe of Levi; hence, he was born a priest
Because his mother was barren and both parents were advanced in age, humanly speaking, it was impossible for his conception to take place
The birth of John was miraculous and astounding, causing the neighbors and relatives to rejoice with astonishment
When some were about to call him by the name of his father, Zachariah, his mother answered and said, 'No, but he shall be called John'
When they gestured to Zachariah as to what his child should be called, he miraculously wrote on the tablet, 'John is his name'
And the young child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his presentation to Israel'
As one who was born a priest, and according to the regulations of the Old Testament, John should have spent much time in the temple
John lived in a way that was absolutely contrary to religion, culture, and tradition and outside of religion, culture, and tradition
He wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather girdle about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey
He wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather girdle about his loins, he ate locusts and wild honey, and he lived in the wilderness
All these things were uncivilized, uncultured, and completely contrary to the religious regulations and the Judaic traditions
Although John lived in a way that was contrary to religion, culture, and tradition, he taught people to live a superior life
Repentance with baptism is for forgiveness of sins, so that the obstacle of man's fall may be removed and man may be reconciled to God
We see that although John preached a baptism of repentance, the goal of his ministry was a wonderful Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God
John testified that he baptized with water, but the One coming, Christ, will baptize people in the Holy Spirit and fire
The Holy Spirit, into whom Christ baptizes the regenerated believers, is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God
To be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be baptized into Christ , into the Triune God , and even into the Body of Christ
According to the context, the fire here is not the fire in Acts 2:3, which is related to the Holy Spirit; it is the fire of the lake of fire
The Lord's baptism either causes the believers to have life in the Holy Spirit, or causes the unbelievers to perish for eternity in the fire
John the Baptist had the spirit and power of Elijah, and he did the work of Elijah in turning many Israelites to the Lord their God
He was the first one in the New Testament who was filled with the Holy Spirit; hence, in typology he was the Elijah who was about to come
His disciples made his teachings into a new religion to frustrate men from receiving Christ, just as the Pharisees of the old religion did
The ministry of John the Baptist was to introduce men to Christ that Christ might become their Redeemer, their life, and their all
The Israelites took all that God gave to their forefathers in the Old Testament and made it into dead religious regulations and rituals
Though born a priest, he cut himself off from the holy temple and from the traditional religion and culture to live in the wilderness
The baptism of repentance left by him was still accepted by people and became a hindrance to God's New Testament economy
In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily ; He is the effulgence of God's glory and the express image of God's substance
He was in the bosom of the Father from eternity past; after incarnation He is still in the bosom of the Father
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
He as the only begotten Son was with the Father, and He was, is, and always will be in the bosom of the Father
Christ, the only begotten Son of God, expressed God by the Word, life, light, grace, and reality, as revealed in John 1:1, 4, 5, and 14
The Word is God revealed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized, apprehended
Although no one has ever seen God, the Son of God has declared, expressed, Him in the way of being the Word, life, light, grace, and reality
Among the four Gospels in the beginning of the New Testament, Matthew and Luke have a record of His genealogy that explains His status
His being conceived of the Holy Spirit in the womb of a chaste virgin was the coming of God Himself into this chaste virgin to be conceived
He has not only the divine nature but also the human nature; He has both natures, divinity and humanity, at the same time
He is a God-man, One who is constituted with the divine nature and the human nature, that is, the divine essence plus the human essence
Luke 2:1-3 says, 'Now it came about in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for all the inhabited earth to be enrolled
Apart from the decree of Caesar Augustus, it might not have been possible for Mary and Joseph to go from Nazareth to Bethlehem
Due to the occupancy of the busy activities of fallen mankind, there was no room for Him in the inn, so that He had to be laid in a manger
The angel went on to say, 'And this is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger'
The praise of the heavenly army has two aspects: glory in the highest places to God and peace on earth among men of His good pleasure
The Lord's salvation has accomplished these two aspects: bringing glory to God in heaven and peace to men on earth
In Luke 2:15-20 we are told that the shepherds went to Bethlehem and 'found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger
The shepherds, after hearing the announcement of the angel and after coming to see the little child, began to speak to others
It was a man who lived yet He lived out God it was the Triune God with all His virtues lived out from humanity and manifested in human form
The New Testament at its beginning presents four biographies to portray the four main aspects of this all-inclusive Christ
When the Lord Jesus was about thirty years old , the legal age to be a priest , He came out to minister and work for God
The first miracle that the Lord did in His ministry was to change water into wine, manifesting His divine glory
He also used a small portion of food to feed five thousand people at one time and four thousand people at another time
Leprosy is the most contaminating and damaging disease, much more serious than fever and isolating its victim both from God and from men
The Lord Jesus' cleansing of a leper signifies His recovering of the sinner to the fellowship with God and with men
The Lord Jesus came to be the Savior of mankind not only to save people from sins but also to save them from death
From the Lord Jesus' baptism and the beginning of His ministry to the Passover recorded in John 2:13 was about half a year
From this Passover to the Passover mentioned in John 12:1 and 19:14 was again another year, which was the year of His death
The Lord Jesus was on the cross from nine o'clock in the morning to three o'clock in the afternoon for a total of six hours
He died on the cross with a sevenfold status to accomplish an all-inclusive death for us and for everything that He redeemed
He died as a man in the flesh in the likeness of the flesh of sin in the form of fallen man to condemn sin and to deal with the flesh of sin
He died as the last Adam , as a man in the old creation, for us who are in the old creation, crucifying our old man on the cross
His offering of Himself was once for all , and the redemption accomplished through His death is eternal , having an eternal efficacy
By shedding His blood and dying once, He is able to redeem all those who believe in Him, in all times and in all places
By the blood of Jesus the Son of God and through the eternal Spirit of God, Christ accomplished an eternal, unlimited redemption
The Lord Jesus died, and in the evening of that day He was buried by two of His disciples, Joseph of Arimathea, a rich man, and Nicodemus
He was born in the reign of the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus in the city of Bethlehem in Judea, and was laid in a manger
He then lived in the small city of Nazareth in the despised province of Galilee and grew up to be a despised Nazarene
In this lesson we will continue to see Jesus Christ as the center of the New Testament, from His resurrection to His eternity future
The Jews who persecuted Him said that the words He spoke and the things He did were a blasphemy to God and that He was liable to death
Through His death and resurrection He was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit , that He might impart God's life to His believers
He, the Firstborn from among the dead and the Firstborn of God among many brothers, became in resurrection the Head of the Body, the church
After the Lord Jesus breathed Himself as the Spirit into the believers in resurrection, He was in them to be with them
Glory refers to the splendor related to Christ's person; honor refers to the preciousness of His worth and the dignity of His position
Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth
Whatever Christ, the Head over all things and the Head of the church , has attained and obtained is transmitted to His Body, the church
In His ascension Christ received these saints, whom He had rescued through His death and resurrection, from God as gifts
God exalted the Man Jesus who was rejected and killed by the Jews as the highest Leader and as the Ruler of the kings to rule over the world
Hebrews 8:2 reveals that the ascended Christ is also a Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, in the heavens
When Christ ascended above all the heavens, He was also made the High Priest of the new covenant according to the order of Melchisedec
John 2:1 tells us that the heavenly Christ is also our Advocate before God; He is the righteous One, the only righteous Man among all men
He is called King of kings and Lord of lords and He rules and reigns over all mankind on the earth to execute Gods eternal kingdom to them
He will marry the faithful and overcoming saints as His bride in the millennial kingdom to enjoy His marriage feast
After He accomplishes the above three things, Christ will descend from the air to the earth with the saints as His bride
He will destroy the religious system of Roman Catholicism and Christianity; He will also destroy the false believers
In Christs second coming Antichrist will lead the great armies of the nations to surround the people of Israel and Jerusalem to destroy them
Christ will judge the inhabited earth in righteousness before the millennial kingdom as the Judge of the living and the dead
In His second coming, Christ will further execute God's judgment pronounced on the rebellious Satan by binding and imprisoning him
The 'sheep' who are justified and blessed will be the people in the earthly part of the millennium, that is, the kingdom of the Son of Man
The saved Israelites will serve as priests in the earthly part to teach the people, 'the sheep,' how to serve God
The Devil who deceived the people will be cast into the lake of fire, where Antichrist and his false prophet also will be
In His second coming Christ will use nearly one thousand years to thoroughly clean up the whole universe and put it in order
Revelation 21:9 refers to the New Jerusalem as the wife of the Lamb, indicating that Christ is the Husband of the New Jerusalem
The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in
In the new heaven and new earth, the holy city New Jerusalem will be a mutual dwelling place for both God and man for eternity
God and the Lamb are one, because God is the light and the Lamb is the lamp; the light is in the lamp, and the two are one
In the preceding text we have seen that there is a river of water of life flowing as a spiral through the entire city
He is truly worthy to receive our worship, exaltation, praise, and love without limit and without end unto the age of the ages!
His second coming has two aspects: from the heavenly throne to the air secretly and from the air to the earth openly
Before the secret aspect begins, the overcoming and early-matured believers will be raptured to His throne in heaven
The overcoming believers will be married to Christ to be His bride in the millennium and to enjoy His marriage feast
All things were created in Him, through Him, and unto Him , and He also upholds all things by the word of His power
He is the perfect man, the Son of Man who was born of the virgin Mary , and who, becoming in the likeness of men , lived as a man
According to the requirement of God's righteousness, without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins
The Lord Jesus took on a body of blood and flesh, and He gave His life and shed His blood on the cross to be the ransom for many
Romans 5:10 also indicates that, since we were reconciled to God, we need to be saved much more in the life of the resurrected Christ
To be redeemed is outward, objective, and once for all; to be saved is inward, subjective, and daily for our whole life long
After the Lord Jesus was born according to Gods ordination He was named Jesus which means Jehovah the Savior or Jehovah the salvation
The Lord Jesus is also Christ , the Messiah anointed by God , the Christ appointed by God and commissioned by God to accomplish God's plan
When the Lord Jesus was born, the angel declared that 'a Savior was born to you today in David's city, who is Christ the Lord'
After the Lord Jesus died and was resurrected , the disciples saw Him and called Him Lord ; at this time He was the resurrected Lord
Resurrection is in contrast to death in particular; resurrection is that which passes through death and triumphs over death
He also experienced human sufferings, sorrows, despisings, rejections , trials, and temptations , and He even wept
Having nullified death through His death, He brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel in His resurrection
All these seven items of His accomplishments were accomplished once for all and have become accomplished facts
While He was on the earth, He as the God-man lived out the divine attributes in His human virtues, thus expressing what God is in humanity
In His resurrection He uplifted the human virtues that the divine attributes might be expressed in an uplifted way in this resurrected Man
His glorification was the manifestation of the God of glory from within Him to become His glory, thus making His person full of splendor
The Lord's person is glorious, His worth is precious, His position is dignified, and His name is the highest, that God may be glorified
In His ascension the Lord Jesus received the kingship from God to be the highest Leader in God's administration, ruling over all the kings
The first thing Christ did after His ascension was to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to men that they might believe and be saved
As the kingdom of God in this age, the church is the place in which God rules and carries out His will on the earth
After Christ established the new covenant on the earth through His death , He ascended to the heavens to be the Mediator of the new covenant
In the heavens today Christ is also our High Priest , interceding before God for us that we may be saved to the uttermost
He is also like Melchisedec , supplying the bread of life and the wine to us who are still on the earth living and fighting for Him
At the end of this age, the Lord will receive the kingdom from God and will come back to the earth with God's kingdom
The holy city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it for the glory of God illumined it and its lamp is the Lamb
In the holy city a river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street
On this side and on that side of the river is the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, and yielding its fruit each month
The nations on the new earth will take the deeds of Christ as their guide and regulation outwardly that they may live the human life forever
The gospel is concerning a living person, the God-man, concerning what He is and does, and all that He has attained and obtained
He is the Redeemer who died and shed His blood to redeem us outwardly, objectively, once for all by His precious blood
He is also the Savior who resurrected from the dead to save us inwardly, subjectively, day by day, by His divine life
He is the life-giving Spirit who enters into His disciples to be their life and to be joined to them as one spirit
He is the resurrection and He has overcome death to be the resurrection life and the resurrection power within us
In His ascension He has obtained the throne, glory, honor, the name which is above every name, the lordship, and the rulership
The gospel is called the glad tidings and is worthwhile for us to preach at every time and in every place throughout our whole life!
For such a building work of the Body of Christ, God has particularly separated a group of people and given them as gifts to the church
Ephesians 411 tells us that the ascended Christ gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists and some shepherdteachers to the church
Apostles are the greatest gifts given by Christ to the church, and they are also placed by God in the highest office in the universal church
God appoints the apostles in particular and sends them out to work for God in different places and establish churches
While the Lord Jesus worked on earth to fulfill His ministry, He chose twelve disciples to continue His work and called them apostles
Judas lost his apostleship due to his betrayal of the Lord; therefore, God chose Matthias to rank with the other eleven
Immediately following the descending of the Spirit, the twelve apostles carried on the work from Acts chapter two to chapter twelve
Aside from the Twelve, the Holy Spirit is still sending out apostles for the accomplishment of God's New Testament economy
In the New Testament not only Barnabas and Paul were apostles but many others also were raised up by the Holy Spirit to become such apostles
Because there were many other apostles besides the Twelve, it was possible for the false apostles to call themselves apostles
Although apostleship is the highest office set up by God, the apostles are not a group of extraordinary people
The apostles were always on the move doing the work; they did not settle down to shepherd a church, but they were constantly traveling
He gives those who have the gift of prophecy and the ability to prophesy as gifts to the church that the church may be built up
In the church they not only speak for God and speak forth God, but sometimes they also predict for God for the edification of the church
As the greatest gift in the local church, prophets can cause a local church to be built up more than the other gifts
In the meetings of the local church prophesying to speak for God can render the greatest spiritual supply to the church
Just as apostleship is the greatest office for the universal church, so prophesying is the greatest gift for the local church
Prophets and teachers can be such men because they have received the gift of prophecy and the gift of teaching, respectively
Perhaps because they have received the evangelistic gift, they are set up by God to be the evangelists with the evangelistic office
Although God commands all believers to preach the gospel, the Bible shows us that God especially set some to be evangelists
