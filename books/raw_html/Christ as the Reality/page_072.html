<h2 class=head2>All the Cleansed Ones</h2><p>But there is also a fifth party. All the people of God who are clean are also entitled to enjoy the peace offering. “But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the Lord, even that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Lev. 7:20-21). All the clean ones among the children of God are entitled to enjoy the peace offering. This is Christ in the Lord’s table meeting. At the Lord’s table, Christ is our peace offering.<p>Coming to the Lord’s table is a declaration to the whole universe that we have peace with God. It is also a declaration that we have peace with all the saints. If I do not have peace with a certain brother, it is rather difficult for me to come to the Lord’s table in a true way. To come to the Lord’s table is to declare that we have peace with God and peace with one another. We have peace with all the priesthood, and we even have peace with ourselves. We have peace with all the saints, so we are in the feast enjoying Christ as our peace offering. There is a part for God, a part for the serving ones, a part for the priesthood, a great part for the presenter, and also a part for all the saints. This is our real communion. Our communion is simply Christ as the peace offering for God’s enjoyment, for the serving one’s enjoyment, for the priesthood’s enjoyment, for our enjoyment, and for the enjoyment of all the saints.<p>The proper way to have the Lord’s table is not simply a matter of singing hymns, praising, and praying while taking the bread and the wine. It is absolutely a matter of having the full enjoyment for these five parties. There must be the enjoyment for God, for the serving ones, for the priesthood, for the presenter, and for all the attendants who are clean. In other words, the Lord’s table meeting is a matter of enjoyment, so it is a feast full of gladness.<h2 class=head1>BLOWING THE TRUMPET</h2><p>Numbers 10:10 tells us that we should blow the trumpet over the sacrifice of our peace offering. What does it mean to blow the trumpet? It simply means to declare and to proclaim. The trumpet was a picture, and the fulfillment is to proclaim. We need to proclaim to the whole universe, “Look all of you angels, demons, and even the Devil! Look at the peaceful enjoyment that we have here! As the redeemed ones, we have peace with God, we have peace with one another, and we even have peace with ourselves. We are enjoying Christ in the presence of God and with one another!”<p>I do not believe that many Christians today have fully realized to such an extent what the Lord’s table is. We all must realize that the Lord’s table is a feast with Christ as the peace offering for all five parties to enjoy. God is here, the serving ones are here, the priests are here, and the presenters with all the children of God are here. When all five parties are together we do not sit inactively, but trumpet and proclaim to the universe, “What a Christ we have!” He is our peace, not only in an objective way, but as our enjoyment. We are enjoying peace, and this peace is Christ.<p>Christ as the peace offering is not like manna sent from the heavens. This offering is something that we must bring to the tent of meeting. What we bring to the meeting is the very Christ whom we have experienced as the burnt offering and the meal offering. After experiencing Christ in such a way, we have something of Him to bring to the meeting to offer to God as the peace offering for a mutual enjoyment for all the five parties. This is the presentation and the enjoyment of the peace offering, and this is a full portrait of the Lord’s table.
