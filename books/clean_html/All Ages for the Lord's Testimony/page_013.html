<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>SHEPHERDING THE SAINTS</h1><p>We have seen that in the church life there is the need not only for elders, but also for prophets, teachers, and exhorters. Our problem today is that the eldership occupies too great a place in our concept. Brothers who love the Lord and have the ability to do something for the church have the subconscious desire to be elders. Nothing has bothered me more through the years than to see in so many brothers this hidden expectation to be elders. Yes, in 1 Timothy 3:1 Paul does say that he who desires to be an elder, an overseer, desires a good work. But the motive must be pure, wholly for the Lord’s interest and without personal ambition. However, some of the brothers who want to be elders are motivated by ambition. For this reason, I have the burden to point out that there is much more to the church life than eldership. In the “hotel” of the church life in the Lord’s recovery there is not only the “room” of eldership but also that of prophesying, teaching, and exhorting. Nevertheless, many brothers endeavor to get into the room called “eldership,” and many sisters want to enter the room called “leading sisters.” But we have no such thing as leading sisters. I do not even like to hear this term used. We all need to forget about position and title. The New Testament reveals that besides eldership there are many other functions the saints can fulfill according to their burden.<h2 class=head1>A TESTIMONY AND AN EXAMPLE</h2><p>I thank the Lord for the testimony and example of brother Eugene Gruhler, Sr. Although he was neither an elder nor a leader among us, he did a great deal of shepherding. He functioned in this way until the very hour the Lord took him to Himself. During the years he was with us, he invited a great many brothers and sisters into his home. Everyone who spent time with him was strengthened and edified. This is what the church needs today. Although Brother Gruhler never sat in the front row, he was always watchful for new ones and invited them to his home for a meal at the first opportunity. The church needs such shepherds today.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICAL SPIRITUALITY</h2><p>In Shanghai the more experienced sisters were exercised to take care of others during the meetings. Realizing that many needed to be warmed and comforted, they purposely sat next to new ones or weak ones in order to help them. If you sit next to a weaker one in the meeting, that one will be greatly helped.<p>In the church life we need “mothers” and “fathers” to take care of the spiritual children. The church needs shepherding; it does not need brothers and sisters to come together in special groups according to their preference. It is not normal for “mothers” to abandon their spiritual children and spend all their time together. That is not the proper family life. Although the “mothers” may come together at certain times, they should spend more time in caring for the new ones, the young ones, and the weak ones. We need a practical spirituality, not a spirituality in word. If we have such a practical spirituality, we shall care for those who are not coming to the church meetings.<p>Certain ones among us claim that they have seen the Body. Time will prove whether or not they have actually seen the Body. However, we should not make such a claim nor have any confidence in such claims. You may say that you have seen the Body, but you may not have anything practical. If you have truly seen the Body, you will be concerned for the weaker ones.
