   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO ANXIETY IN THE JUBILEE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we are living in the jubilee, we shall not have any anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning anxiety, the Lord Jesus says, Do not be anxious about your life, what you should eat and what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on....Which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?...Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sufficient for the day is its own evil Matt 6:25, 27, 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no need for us to borrow tomorrow s anxiety and bear it today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every day has its own evil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, some saints, young as well as old, borrow anxiety not only from tomorrow but from years to come.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that some are anxious not only concerning tomorrow but concerning what will happen years from now.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some grandparents may even be anxious concerning their third generation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They actually borrow the anxiety of a future generation and labor under it today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you know why we are anxious both about today and tomorrow?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are anxious because God does not have the full ground within us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We still give a corner of our being to other things, and that corner causes us trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, if we give all the room in our heart to God, we shall not be anxious or troubled by whatever happens to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If in our hearts there is no ground for anything or anyone other than God, He will always be our enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The environment may change, but He remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is very difficult for us to give all the ground in our being to God because we are fallen and have a fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The very cells and fibers of our physical bodies and our entire soul, including our mind, will, and emotion, are fallen from God, from the enjoyment of God, and from rest in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have fallen into many things other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Anything, whether good or bad, that is not God Himself can be a source of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only God is enjoyment; only God is satisfaction and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No matter how good something else may be, it cannot be our enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A LIFE THAT LIVES GOD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The life of jubilee, that is, the life that lives in the jubilee, is a life that lives God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When some hear this, they may say, Isn t this the victorious life?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Isn t this a holy life, a life of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yes, the life of jubilee is a victorious and holy life, and it is a life of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But although we have heard many messages on living in the Spirit, we still do not live very much in the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, we have the labor of struggling to improve ourselves, the labor of anxiety, the labor of dreaming, and the labor of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What a hard labor it is to struggle to be good!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is an even harder labor to worry, to have anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is also a labor to dream, to have expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every kind of expectation is a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Finally, there is the labor of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we have suffering, we cannot have enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can we be released from all this labor?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The only way to be released is to take the Triune God as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the all-inclusive Spirit will render us His bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we shall enjoy God in Christ as the good land flowing with milk and honey, and we shall have enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all need this jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Gospel of Luke leads us into the life of the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Man-Savior saves us from bondage into the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He saves us into the liberty, enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest of God s jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The entire New Testament teaching concerning the Christian life involves the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the kingdom comes, we shall enjoy a greater jubilee than we enjoy today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then in eternity, in the New Jerusalem with the new heaven and new earth, we shall have the greatest jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We shall enjoy God in full as our satisfaction and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today we have a foretaste of this jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All day long we should enjoy God as our enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not struggle, worry, dream, or suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even in the most difficult situation we can still enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we give all the ground in us to God and enjoy Him, not even martyrdom will be a suffering to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead of struggle, anxiety, dreams, and suffering, we shall have the all-inclusive processed Triune God as our enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the enjoyment of the jubilee.</S>
