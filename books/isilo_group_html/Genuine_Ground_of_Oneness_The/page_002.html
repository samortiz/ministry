Satan, the enemy of God, hates this matter of the church ground, which has been concealed from the Lord's people for centuries. The ground of the church is directly related to the importance of the church. Certain portions of the Word such as Matthew, Ephesians, and Revelation reveal the importance of the church. Let us first consider the importance of the church as shown in these books. Then we shall go on to consider the inward and outward aspects of the church. This will prepare us to appreciate the oneness manifested in the four great acts of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PLANNED IN ETERNITY PAST</H2><P>In Ephesians, a book on the church, we see that the church was planned by God in eternity past. According to the desire of His heart, God planned before time began to have the church. Hence, the church is according to God's eternal purpose, according to the eternal plan of God. Although the church came into existence in time, it was planned by God in eternity.</P><P>Not many Christians today have a serious regard for the church. They tend to take the church for granted and concentrate on matters such as salvation, holiness, victory, and spirituality. When Christians do speak of the church, it is often in the way of debating or criticizing. Very few believers pay attention to the church in a positive way. Many seeking Christians consider it a waste of time to devote their attention to the church. Nevertheless, in the book of Ephesians we see that the church is related to God's will and to the desire of God's heart. Since the church is such a great matter in the eyes of God, we dare not take it lightly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY, THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</H2><P>Ephesians also reveals that the church is the Body, "the fullness of the One Who fills all in all" (1:23). The church is the Body, the fullness, of the all-inclusive, infinite, unlimited Christ. How great the church is! It is not a mere association or religious organization. The church is the very Body of Christ. Just as we need a physical body through which to express ourselves, so the infinite and unlimited Christ needs a Body as His fullness in order that He may be expressed in the universe. Certainly this is far more important than personal salvation or spirituality. If we see that the church is the Body, the fullness, of the all-inclusive Christ, we shall never again regard it as an insignificant matter.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Genuine Ground of Oneness &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
