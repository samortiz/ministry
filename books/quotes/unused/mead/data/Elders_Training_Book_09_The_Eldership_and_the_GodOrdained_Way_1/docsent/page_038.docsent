   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question: When the leading brothers come together to pray for the church, am I understanding correctly that you do not bring up any of the problems that you see in the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Answer: Even with what we say to our wives, we must exercise our wisdom in order to have a marriage life with a peaceful and sweet feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must exercise our wisdom what to say and what not to say to our wives.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We also have to be careful how much we say.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are a little careless in talking to our wives, we can create trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I know of some cases where a careless word from the husband to the wife resulted in a problem for their entire marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to exercise our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If there are three elders in a certain locality, these brothers also need to exercise their wisdom in what they say to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you, as one of the three elders, see some problems with the saints, do not talk to the other two brothers right away.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to bring this matter to the Lord and pray for it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You can ask the Lord, "Lord, what I feel about this matter may be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Show me the real situation."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In prayer you can follow the Lord step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then you will have the leading of the Lord with some amount of assurance that the Lord is with you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this kind of spirit and with this kind of atmosphere, you can go to the other two brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You also may ask the Lord, "Should I go to both brothers or should I just go to one?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Which one should I go to?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Maybe the Lord would tell you to go to a certain brother and not to the other one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wait for awhile.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is wisdom, this will help the situation, and this will never create any kind of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The elders should also be careful about letting their wives know the things concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is risky and dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some saints told me things in confidence and charged me not to tell anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One dear saint opened up something to me and charged me not to let anyone know.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He has gone to be with the Lord, but I have kept what he told me in confidence for over thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I never made this matter known to my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some day all of us will give an account to the Lord, so we must not be loose in what we say or tell others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever we say and do really concerns the Lord's recovery, the Lord's interest, and it is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we would exercise this kind of wisdom, many troubles would be and could be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must do our best to avoid trouble and do our best to say the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All of us are assured that there is no heresy among us, and I do not believe that anyone of us has a bad feeling toward another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not form parties among ourselves or join any parties.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not have a different attitude toward some brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To one brother you may be nice, but to another brother you are a different person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should be the same toward everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are in the Lord's recovery and in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To have any preference for certain saints is wrong.</S>
