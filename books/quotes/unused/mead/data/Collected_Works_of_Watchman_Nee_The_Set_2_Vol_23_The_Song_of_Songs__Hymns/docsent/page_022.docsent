   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Teeth Signifying the Power of Receiving</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The teeth are for chewing food.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not a matter of food itself, but a matter of receiving food.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has shown us in the Bible that He has given us different kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse shows us the power of receiving different kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Symbolically speaking, the power of receiving does not belong to babes, but to grown-ups, because only grown-ups have teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why does it say "a flock of sheep"?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is because only sheep eat grass.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is something within a person that is of Christ; therefore, one is able to receive God's food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only that which matches the Christ within will take in that which comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Bible sheep's wool denotes the fleshly life, or the fleshly zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a priest entered the Holy of Holies, he was not allowed to wear anything that was made of wool Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>44:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Bible the righteousness that Christ gives to us through the Holy Spirit is symbolized by white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The natural life of the saints has been removed by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, this verse says that the maiden's teeth are like a flock that has been shorn.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It means that her power of reception is no longer motivated by natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In pursuing after the Lord, in receiving His grace, and in our study of the Bible, we must not exercise fleshly zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Exercising our own strength and following our own ways is having teeth that are disapproved of by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The shorn flock is also washed; it is clean and orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The washing signifies that the goal of the maiden's pursuit is the cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means orderliness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It means that the power of reception is uniform throughout.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One does not reject some things and receive other things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One does not possess faith in spiritual things, but no faith in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If one only receives certain truths, or if he cannot have faith in material things, his teeth do not bear twins, and some of them are barren.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Bearing twins and not being barren is receiving in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our natural teeth are always in pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The maiden's teeth bearing twins means that her receiving power is even and uniform throughout.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lips Signifying Expression</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If teeth signify reception, lips must signify expression.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If teeth are for food, lips must be for expressing what has been digested.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the new creation, the Lord cares not only for our insight, our consecration, and our power of receiving, but for our words also.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are two ways to explain "a thread of scarlet."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1 It signifies redemption Josh 2:21 , and 2 authority Matt 27:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the one hand, it is a sign of cleansed lips Isa 6:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, it signifies that all speakings are under the authority of the King and that the lips are under the control of the King's rule.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not like Psalm 12:4, which says, "With our tongue will we prevail;/Our lips are our own: Who is lord over us?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only lips that have passed through redemption, that are subject to the Lord's authority, and that do not speak according to one's own will have a "comely" speech S.S. 4:3 . The teeth are mentioned before the lips because if something wrong is taken in, whatever comes out will surely be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Temples Signifying Outward Beauty</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The "temples" can be translated as "cheeks."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Cheeks are the place where beauty is displayed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All our outward expressions joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, and so forth are seen through the cheeks.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not a whole pomegranate, but an open one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Bible, the pomegranate signifies the abundance of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Pomegranates are full of seeds, and every seed is juicy, red, sweet, and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that the outward beauty of the believers comes from an overflow of the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Still, everything must be veiled from the world's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the significance of the pomegranate being within the locks or the veils.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In other words, the only One who is aware of our beauty is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although we should have a good testimony from those outside, and although our light should shine before men, such acts are not for our exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our expression is only before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The principle of a believer's living is forever one of being within the veil and behind closed doors.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Neck Signifying the Submission of the Will</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The neck signifies man's will.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Bible speaks of those who walk according to their self-will, who are stubborn and proud, as stiff-necked ones Isa 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, the neck denotes man's will under God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord considers the submission of man's will as the most beautiful thing in man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this verse there are two aspects of a submissive will.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First, "Thy neck is like the tower."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A tower describes a condition that is opposite to that of a hunchback.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those whose necks are not straight are hunchbacked.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the Bible, hunchbacks are bound by Satan to face the earth all the time Luke 13:11, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The neck being like a tower means that the person is released; there is no bondage of Satan and no love for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A tower also means strength.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The maiden's will has been strengthened by God to the point that she no longer loves the world and is no longer affected by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Second, "Thy neck is like the tower of David."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is not an ordinary tower, but the tower of David.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In addition to the sense of strength and deliverance, we also see that the maiden's will has been brought into complete submission to David.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Her strength lies in her submission to Christ, and her deliverance also lies in her submission to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should all realize the importance of being taken captive by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What is the use of this tower?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is "builded for an armory."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This means that spiritual warfare is fought for the purpose of claiming the will.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The armory stored within the tower signifies the victory of Christ for the preservation of the believers' will from the enemy's usurpation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, the weapons are not for attack, but for defense.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Therefore, only bucklers and shields are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Bucklers and shields are for protection.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>"A thousand" means that the number is great.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>"Mighty men" denotes strength.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In summary, this verse indicates that the maiden is willing to submit completely to David's will.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>She is as strong as a tower in carrying out David's will.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>She is on guard vigilantly and does not allow the enemy to usurp her submissive will.</S>
