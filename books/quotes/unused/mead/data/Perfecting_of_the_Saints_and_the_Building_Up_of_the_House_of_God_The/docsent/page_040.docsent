   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT BEING ABLE TO COORDINATE WITH OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITHOUT LEARNING LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, it may not be beneficial for the workers who have not learned any lessons to move.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It may be better for these workers to remain in their locality until they learn some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all have a portion of supply, and we have our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These problems hinder us from learning lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In some places the workers and the local saints are unable to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A worker who cannot coordinate with the local saints has not learned some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every worker must learn lessons to be able to coordinate with the saints in any locality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a worker has problems coordinating with local saints, the difficulty in coordinating is not because of the local saints; it is because the worker has not learned some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a recent training we said that the character of a worker must be as pliable as paste.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paste can be applied to any surface.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It can be applied to a surface that is hollow or that protrudes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It can be applied to a surface that is rough or that is smooth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is hardly a surface to which paste cannot be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, if a worker is not able to coordinate with the local brothers, most likely it is because he has not learned the lessons that make his character as pliable as paste.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Workers who travel to a place and lord it over the saints have not learned this lesson 1 Pet 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The workers who are pliable as paste will be subject to the local brothers and willing to learn from them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the local brothers need them to sweep the floor, they will sweep the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The workers should be willing to learn from the local brothers who take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We first need to learn from others before we can lead others to learn from us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have a better way to sweep the floor, the leading brothers will notice and learn from us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, some workers think that they are assigned to bear all the responsibility in a place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, they take over everything and assign the saints to sweep the floor, move tables, set up chairs, and do other services.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not right to overturn everything that has been arranged by others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is also inappropriate for a worker to hold a conference simply because he knows more than the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if he truly knows something, there is no need for him to hold a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there is a need to hold a conference, the local brothers should initiate it and ask the worker to help.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A worker should never insist on holding a conference because he was sent by the workers to care for the church and to supply their need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This has happened in the past, and it indicates that workers who have not learned some basic lessons should not go out to help the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Workers who have not learned these lessons are always eager to travel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They want to coordinate with saints in other places, even though they cannot coordinate with the saints in their own locality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the workers who want to go out must learn some serious lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In many cases, the workers who want to travel should stay in their locality, and the workers who are reluctant to travel should be sent out to supply the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Often, the workers who want to travel have problems in their locality; consequently, they are eager to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The saints are happy when these workers go out to travel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such workers should not travel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When workers who may not want to travel are sent out, the saints miss them because these workers are always taking care of the needs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such workers truly supply the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a good lesson for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A worker who cannot coordinate with the local saints should examine himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The workers must learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should never blame the saints and say that they cannot coordinate with us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, we should find the reason that we cannot coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This can be compared to a child learning to write.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no problem with the pen and the ink; the problem is that the child lacks practice and skill.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, when we encounter a problem, we should consider ourselves, not the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are many scientific things that I do not understand, but I know and understand spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should be able to coordinate with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as we learn spiritual lessons, we will be able to coordinate with any brother.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>LEARNING SKILLS</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>IN ADDITION TO LEARNING LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to coordinate, we not only need to learn lessons; even more we need to learn skills.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To learn a skill does not mean that we are political.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, it means that we learn to handle a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we cannot coordinate with the saints, we should consider whether we should change the way that we coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to willingly and in all sincerity seek the advice of the saints whom we are coordinating with.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am the most troublesome worker.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have adjusted others frequently and pointed out their mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Nevertheless, wherever I go, I can coordinate with the saints and not cause anyone to be irritated and stop serving.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order to coordinate, we must learn to accommodate others and be willing to learn from them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This requires much learning.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is a spiritual lesson in the divine life that requires much time and practice to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the same principle, we should never say that we cannot get through because the saints do not accept our work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should never condemn the saints and say that they are too busy, their hearts are hardened, or they do not have a heart for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There would be no need for us to preach the gospel if the people in the world had a heart for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Neither would there be a need for us to supply the saints if every brother and sister were like the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The saints need us to work with them and serve them because they are busy and have a less than fervent heart for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, we should never leave a place simply because we encounter some difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we cannot get through in one way, we should find another way, and if the second way does not work, we should try a third way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should continue trying until we get through.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is no place or person that cannot be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some tools can cut wood, and other tools can cut diamonds.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we were in England, we were taken to a place where diamonds are cut.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Diamond is the hardest rock.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is easy to find a person who can cut glass or metal, but it is difficult to find a person who can cut a diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To cut a diamond requires skill; it does not depend on the diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, we should never say that we cannot work in a place because the saints are not good and because they reject our work.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must learn spiritual lessons and also learn skills.</S>
