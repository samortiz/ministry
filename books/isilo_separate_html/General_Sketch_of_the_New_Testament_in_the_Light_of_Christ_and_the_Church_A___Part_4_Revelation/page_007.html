<p>The churches in Revelation 2 and 3 represent the stages of the history of the church. The latter stages of the church have more to do with us today than the first ones, so we must be more familiar with them. The church in Sardis depicts the fifth stage of the history of the church, the church during the Reformation (3:1-6). The Greek word for <em>Sardis</em> means &ldquo;remainder&rdquo; or&ldquo;restoration.&rdquo;No doubt, the Reformation which began at the time of Martin Luther was the fulfillment of the prophecy in this epistle. Although the Reformation was good, everything in it was very weak. According to history, none of its works were completed (v. 2). This is why the Lord says, &ldquo;You have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead&rdquo; (v. 1).</p>
<p>On the one hand, many things were recovered in the Reformation, but on the other hand, many of those things withered away. In the reformed churches, that is, the Protestant churches, there is always recovery then withering, followed by more recovery and more withering. There are many revivals, each followed by a falling away. The history of the Protestant churches is a history of revival and falling, recovery and withering. Nothing there is strong, adequate, living, or permanent. Therefore, the Lord is not satisfied with Sardis, the reformed church.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church became an international church, mixed with all the nations but under one head, the pope. Although during the Reformation the church gave up its international character, it fell to become the national churches. Luther himself admitted that this was wrong, but he could not avoid it because the political influence was too great. Luther was one of the greatest servants of the Lord, and we do not want to criticize him, but we must speak the truth. He was strong in dealing with the pope yet weak before the kings. We cannot say why he was this way; perhaps it is simply because he was human. He dealt strongly with Catholicism and the pope, but he was weak in dealing with the German king. The German king eventually formed the state church of Germany, and other nations followed suit. This is why today we have the national churches. In Denmark, the king is the head of the Danish church, which is the Lutheran Church. Likewise, in England the queen is the head of the Church of England, the national church.</p>
<p>After the national churches came into existence, many seeking ones were not satisfied with them. They became the dissenters and began to form dissenting churches, the private churches such as the Presbyterian Church and the Baptist Church. In the eyes of the Lord, both the national churches and the private churches are weak and full of deadness, so the Lord rebuked them. The reformed churches did not satisfy the Lord&rsquo;s heart because they did not fully return to the normal condition of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN PHILADELPHIA</h2>
<p>About three hundred years after the Reformation, the sixth stage of the church began, symbolized by the church in Philadelphia (vv. 7-13). In the epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 there are several meaningful names, such as Balaam, the Nicolaitans, and Jezebel. Now verse 7 speaks of Philadelphia, which means &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo;According to the history of the church, the prophecy in this epistle was fulfilled in the practice of the Brethren, whom the Lord raised up in the early part of the nineteenth century. During their first twenty years, the Brethren were marvelous. The Brethren recovered many spiritual matters, and they opened up the Word of God. They truly came back to the normal condition of the church. The Brethren absolutely repudiated and forsook all the things brought into the church by the teaching of Balaam, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, and the teachings of Jezebel.</p>
<p>Certain Bible teachers such as D. M. Panton tell us that the Brethren movement was more powerful than the Reformation, although many people today do not know much about it. The Reformation had too much to do with political matters, and to a great extent it became a worldly movement. The Brethren, on the other hand, did not advertise themselves, and they had nothing to do with worldly affairs. Some of the Brethren were lords and ladies in society, but when they were gained for this testimony, they renounced their titles. In the entire history of the church, there has never been a group of believers as the Brethren who gave up the world in such an absolute way.</p>
<p>The Brethren were rich in the recovery of the truth. More than ninety percent of the fundamental teachings in Christianity come from the discoveries made by the Brethren teachers. The Scofield Reference Bible is very popular in the United States today, but Scofield was just the &ldquo;salesman,&rdquo; not the &ldquo;factory,&rdquo; of his teachings. The truths in almost all the notes in his Reference Bible and the teachings in his correspondence course came from Brethren writings. C. H. Mackintosh was one of many great teachers among the Brethren. D. L. Moody, a great American evangelist in the last century, once said that if someone were to burn all the books in the entire world, he would be satisfied to have just one copy of the Bible and a set of Mackintosh&rsquo;s<em>Notes on the Pentateuch.</em> To Moody, all Christian writings except these meant little. Besides Mackintosh, there were many other great teachers among the Brethren, including J. G. Bellett and William Kelly. C. H. Spurgeon once described William Kelly as one whose mind was as big as the universe. To read the books by the Brethren is a great help.</p>
<p>The Brethren were very influential in their time. In the middle 1800s a certain hurricane caused much damage to the island of Jamaica. Very soon after the news went out, the Brethren in many different parts of the world sent material gifts to rescue the brothers on that island. The money sent by their gifts totaled more than the money sent by the British government.</p>
<p>The Brethren were outstanding in three things&mdash;in brotherly love, in keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word, and in not denying His name (v. 8). They had much brotherly love. They were truly &ldquo;the brothers.&rdquo; Moreover, they dropped every kind of name and title, telling others that they met only in the name of the Lord, and they always kept the word of the Lord. Brotherly love, keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word, and not denying His name were prominent among them, and they dropped all other things. Among them there was no clergy or laity. Brother Watchman Nee once told us that even a cook among the Brethren knew the Bible better than a missionary. Even the small brothers among them were very clear about the Word.</p>
<p>The Brethren began meeting around 1825. By 1829 there were meetings in Italy, and within a short time they spread quickly, even to Arabia.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
