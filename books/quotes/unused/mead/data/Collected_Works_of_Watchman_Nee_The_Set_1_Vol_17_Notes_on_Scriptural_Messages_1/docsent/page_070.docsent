   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BETTER BLOOD Issue No. 24 Scripture Reading: Gen 4:8-11; Heb 12:24; 1 John 5:6, 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These verses mention the blood of the Lord and the blood of Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hebrews 12:24 tells us concerning the Lord's blood that "the blood...speaks something better than that of Abel."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The blood of the Lord Jesus speaks something better than that of Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why does the blood of the Lord Jesus speak something better than that of Abel?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today I would like to speak briefly about this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why was Abel killed?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Cain killed him because he envied him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God looked with favor on Abel and his offering, but He did not look with favor on Cain and his offering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, Cain became jealous of Abel and killed him in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why did the Jews bring the Lord Jesus to the Praetorium before the governor?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Pilate, "he knew that it was because of envy that they had delivered Him up" Matt 27:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only reason the Jews killed the Lord Jesus was that they envied the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Abel was envied by Cain and killed by Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus was envied by the Jews and killed by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why does the blood of the Lord Jesus speak something better than that of Abel?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Abel's blood cried out to God from the ground, demanding God to avenge Him according to righteousness and judge the sin of the man who caused him to bleed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The blood of the Lord Jesus voiced its plea that God treat man with grace and forgive those who caused Him to bleed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The blood of Abel required that God execute righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once God executed righteousness, Adam's child, the sinful Cain, had no place to hide.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The blood of the Lord Jesus requires God to execute righteousness also.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when God executes righteousness, He forgives us our sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since God punished Him, He cannot punish us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God asked Cain, "Where is Abel thy brother?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, "I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What if God asks us today, "Where is your brother Abel?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We thank and praise God that today we can answer: "He was killed by us, but His blood does not accuse us."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The blood of the Lord Jesus does not accuse us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is an amazing salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why does the Bible say that the blood can speak?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First John says the blood testifies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The blood has two functions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One is to propitiate for us before God; the other is to provide a guarantee for us before God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many people only see that the blood of the Lord Jesus propitiates for us but do not see that the blood of the Lord Jesus provides us a guarantee before God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The blood of the Lord is for redemption on the earth and for a testimony in the heavens; it testifies that redemption is accomplished on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On earth the Lord shed His blood to be our Savior; in heaven He serves as our eternal Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What happened on the great day of propitiation?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The blood was poured onto the ground from the altar, and it was also brought into the Holy of Holies by the high priest and put on the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The blood shed on the ground was gone after several days; it dried out and became dust.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the blood brought into the Holy of Holies speaks for us eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The blood shed on the ground is for propitiation, while the blood brought into the Holy of Holies speaks before Jehovah and testifies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the one hand, the Lord shed His blood to forgive our sins and to make propitiation for us; on the other hand, the blood is put before God to speak and testify for us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The sprinkled blood in heaven testifies to the fact of the shed blood propitiation on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What does this blood testify?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For the blood to be before God means that the fact of propitiation is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The blood voicelessly testifies before God and guarantees our eternal peace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If there was no shedding of blood propitiation on earth, where did this sprinkled blood before God come from?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The blood testifies for God; it tells us that God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Otherwise, where does this blood come from?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the same time, the blood testifies for us that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, why was this blood shed?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The blood testifies, on the one hand, the love of God and, on the other hand, our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time, it testifies to Satan so that he can no longer accuse us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thank and praise God; what the blood of the Lord Jesus speaks is better than that of Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This blood is for forgiving, not for avenging; it is for peace, not for accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our Lord shed His blood once and accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today before God, we have the proof of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some say that they are saved because of a certain time of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some say that they are saved because they were so happy after they prayed a certain time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But these feelings are not dependable.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I am a saved person because the Lord's blood testifies before God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What the blood of the Lord speaks of is better than that of Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Abel's blood spoke from the ground and demanded the blood of the one who killed him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The blood of the Lord speaks from heaven and declares His forgiveness of the one who killed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The blood of the Lord testifies for us in heaven forever.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Brothers and sisters, we thank and praise God that the blood of the Lord testifies in heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We seldom realize how the blood of the Lord speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we did, our table here would take on new significance.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The cup not only stands for and expresses something but also tells us that the blood is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We thank and praise God because the blood of Christ cleanses us from all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At the same time, the blood of Christ testifies for us before God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>With this testimony, God cannot refuse us anything.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ has already died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Who can accuse us?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We thank and praise God!</S>
