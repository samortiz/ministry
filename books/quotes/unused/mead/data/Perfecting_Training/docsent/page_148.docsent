   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT THE CONSTITUENTS OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:14 reads, For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we need to consider what are the constituents of the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In principle everything is composed with some things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to find out what the leading of the Spirit of God is composed with.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How is it constituted?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How could we have such a thing that is called the leading of the Spirit of God?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Romans 8:14 there is such a thing within us as the leading of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through all the centuries most Christians have not been so clear about the matter of God s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christians have mostly considered the matter of God s leading in somewhat an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, they would seek the Lord s leading concerning a trip to New York.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But although we were not taught properly concerning the matter of leading, we do have a lot of concepts concerning the matter of leading.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are always concerned about what courses we should take in school, about how much money we should spend, or about the matter of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning these kinds of things we always like to have the leading of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually the leading does matter a lot in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are a Christian, and yet you do not care for the leading of God, you are not a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are a proper Christian you surely like to know what is the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You want to know whether you should rent or buy a house.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You want to know what street you should live on.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You want to know how you should get your hair cut.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you would do this, it would indicate to some extent that you might be a good Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope that when you go to buy a pair of shoes you do consider what color and what style.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you don t consider these matters, you are just a careless Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are not so careful, so sober, as you should be.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A DETAILED CHAPTER</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CONCERNING SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We consider the matter of leading mostly an outward thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I also did until I began to pay so much attention to Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then I began to realize that out of all the sixty-six books in the Bible, perhaps no other chapter unveils to us the spiritual experiences in as much detail as Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of course, the longest chapter in the Bible is Psalm 119.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It tells a lot concerning the praising of the Lord and the contacting of the Lord by the Old Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is some help to be found in that psalm, but it is somewhat old and in the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The longest and most detailed chapter concerning spiritual experience is Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this it is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since I began to realize this chapter with all the details, I began to see a lot of things which I had actually already experienced, but without much knowledge of them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I had little knowledge concerning these matters because such teachings have not been stressed among the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may illustrate this matter with vitamins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hundreds of years ago our forefathers ate a lot of vitamins but without much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without taking in the proper vitamins, a person cannot be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although vitamins had not been discovered many years ago, people had the experience of living by eating the vitamins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Romans 8 there is such a thing which is called the leading of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have to realize it is not mentioned in verses 1-13.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather it is mentioned in the fourteenth verse.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that certain verses have gone before.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And of course more verses follow verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verses 15 to 23 have a lot to do with the matter of the leading in verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So before verse 14 there are thirteen verses, and after verse 14 there are another fourteen verses, all of which are related to the matter of the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are going to understand adequately the leading of the Spirit, you must get into all these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In principle the leading of the Spirit must be composed with some thing or things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There must be some things as the constituents of the constitution of the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Basically the leading of the Spirit of God is composed of three elements, all from verse 2: the law, the Spirit, and life.</S>
