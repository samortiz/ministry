On the one hand, the Bible tells us clearly that God is invisible, yet on the other hand, the Bible tells us also that God has an image. In Genesis 1:26 God says, &#8220;Let us make man in our image.&#8221; But verse 27 says that God created man &#8220;in His own image.&#8221; Verse 26 uses the plural pronoun &#8220;our,&#8221; and verse 27 uses the singular pronoun &#8220;His,&#8221; showing that man was made in the image of the Triune God. Colossians 1:15 tells us that Christ is the image of the invisible God. Thus, man was created according to Christ because Christ is the image of God.<p>God&#8217;s intention is that we would be conformed to the image of His Son (Rom. 8:29). Second Corinthians 3:18 tells us that we have to be transformed into the Lord&#8217;s image from one degree of glory to another degree of glory. We were made in the Triune God&#8217;s image, which is Christ, and eventually we will become God&#8217;s image. We have received Christ into us, and He is gradually transforming us into His image. In eternity as the New Jerusalem, all of God&#8217;s redeemed people will be fully conformed to the image of God&#8217;s Son to express God to the uttermost. Christ is the image of God, so He is the model, the pattern, the mold. When clay or dough is put into a mold, it is conformed into the image of that mold. We were made according to Christ, and we have received Christ into us that we may actually be transformed and conformed into the image of Christ to eventually express Christ in His image in eternity. In eternity we will be absolutely like Him. First John 3:2 says, &#8220;Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we shall be. We know that if He is manifested, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him even as He is.&#8221; God&#8217;s purpose will be fulfilled when we are fully transformed and conformed into His image. At that time, we will be fully one with God and fully after God&#8217;s kind. We will be God&#8217;s expression, fully expressing Him in His image.<h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Intention for Man to Represent Him with His Authority</h2><p>Furthermore, God&#8217;s intention is for man to represent Him with His authority. He desires that man would reign in His life (Rom. 5:17). After the resurrection, the Lord Jesus told the disciples that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). Because all the authority had been given to Him, Christ as the heavenly King sent His disciples to go and disciple all the nations (v. 19). We as His disciples go with His authority. Christ has given us not only His power but also His authority to rule over Satan. In Luke 10:19 the Lord said, &#8220;Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall by any means hurt you.&#8221; Serpents may signify Satan and his angels (Eph. 2:2; 6:11-12); scorpions may signify the demons (Luke 10:17, 20). The disciples subdued their evil power by the authority of the Lord.<p>One day the overcomers will have the authority to rule over the earth, just as Christ has such authority. Revelation 2:26-27 says, &#8220;And he who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations, and he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father.&#8221; Psalm 2:8-9 tells us that God gave Christ authority to rule over the nations; here in Revelation 2, Christ gives the same authority to His overcomers. Revelation 20:4-5 tells us that the overcomers are sitting upon thrones, and authority to judge has been given to them. These overcomers reign with Christ a thousand years. The resurrection of kingship is a reward to the overcomers that they may reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom (cf. Rev. 20:6). Finally, all of God&#8217;s redeemed will &#8220;reign forever and ever&#8221; (Rev. 22:5) as the constituents of the New Jerusalem. To reign forever will be the final blessing to God&#8217;s redeemed in eternity.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Crucial Revelation of Life in the Scriptures &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
