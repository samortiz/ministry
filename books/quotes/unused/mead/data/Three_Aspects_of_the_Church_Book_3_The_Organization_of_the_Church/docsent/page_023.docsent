   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For the Glory and Beauty of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Be Manifested, the Apostles, Elders, and Saints</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All Needing to Be Spiritual</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The apostles who appoint elders must be spiritual, and those who are appointed to be elders must also be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, the saints who receive the elders authority must be spiritual too.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All three must be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Authority in the church is not a matter of autocracy or democracy but theocracy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The problem in many churches is that those who appoint the elders, the appointed ones, and those who receive the appointed elders are not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nevertheless, all say that they do things according to biblical principles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>May we all be clear that biblical principles are not a guarantee of being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only the authority of the Holy Spirit can safeguard us and cause us to be genuinely spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Biblical principles can be living only if they are applied in the Holy Spirit; otherwise, they are merely dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If an apostle is going to appoint an elder, he must ask himself whether or not he is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, if a brother is about to be appointed as an elder, he needs to ask himself whether or not he is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, when a saint receives someone as an elder, an authority, the saint should ask himself whether or not he is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If those who appoint elders, those who are appointed elders, and those who receive the elders are all in the Holy Spirit, others will see God s authority, God s government, in the church, and there will be a free way for the authority of the Head to be realized in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Psalm 133:2-3 says, It is like the fine oil upon the head / That ran down upon the beard, / Upon Aaron s beard, / That ran down upon the hem of his garments; / Like the dew of Hermon / That came down upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>/ For there Jehovah commanded the blessing: / Life forever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this psalm we see the dew, the oil, and Jehovah s commanded blessing, which is, life forever.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the condition of Mount Zion, the condition of the mysterious Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, under this kind of condition, the glory and beauty of the church are fully expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes in our fallen mind, questions may arise, Is the church being controlled by someone?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Are we being controlled?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When such questions arise within us, we should not consider the ones who appoint elders or the ones who are appointed elders; rather, we should consider ourselves and ask, Where am I?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Am I in the Holy Spirit or in the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are living in the Holy Spirit, no one can deceive or control us, and we will certainly know the condition of the ones who appoint elders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time, we will also know the condition of the ones who have been appointed elders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our safeguard does not lie in biblical principles but in the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If those who appoint elders, those who are appointed elders, and those who receive the elders all live according to the self, the church will be under the control of men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although those in the church may say, We are walking according to biblical principles, they have no life and have lost the safeguard of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To live in submission to the authority of the Holy Spirit is to obey the Spirit, not to walk merely according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The administration of the church is safeguarded when everyone submits to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When everyone submits to the Spirit, no one can pretend, nor can anyone deceive or control others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A person who submits to authority does not want to rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more spiritual authority a person has, the less he desires to rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a wonderful matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In contrast, all those who desire to rule over others do not submit to God s authority and do not have God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A person who does not submit to God s authority cannot deceive those who do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we live under the authority of the Holy Spirit, we will know whether a person is living in submission to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will know whether he is a Saul or a David, and we will not be deceived or controlled by him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you say that someone has deceived you or exercised control over you, this indicates that both are living in the same place the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Living in the flesh is contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, if an elder is the flesh and you are a living stone, the contagious infection will not affect you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we stay in the Spirit, we should not be worried about anything, because the Holy Spirit is our safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A person who lives in the flesh and according to his own will is a Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This will be very clear in the spirit of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit will speak, make known, and impart some feeling into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The administration of the church is altogether a matter of God s government, of the authority of the Head, and of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we stay in the Spirit, the church surely will be spiritual and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Similarly, the appointment of deacons is also a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A person does not become a deacon simply because he desires to be one or because a group of brothers has nominated him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This requires the appointing by the apostles and is altogether a matter of the authority of the Head.</S>
