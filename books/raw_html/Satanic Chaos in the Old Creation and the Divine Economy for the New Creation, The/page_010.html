<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. God Putting Man<br>in Front of the Tree of Life</H2><P>God put man in front of the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-17). The tree of life is a figure of Christ as the embodiment of the divine life. Thus, when God put man in front of the tree of life, He was indicating that man should take God in Christ as life for the carrying out of the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Satanic Chaos</H2><P>After the divine economy in the restored universe, we again have the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Satan as the Serpent<br>Tempting Man to Take of the Tree<br>of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</H2><P>The satanic chaos in the old creation began with Satan as the serpent tempting man to take of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 3:1-5). Both good and evil belong to the same tree, and now with the same person we can see good and also evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Man Being Deceived<br>and Becoming Fallen</H2><P>Genesis 3:6 and 7 show us that man was deceived and became fallen. This was the chaos in the restored universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. IN THE FALL OF MAN</H2><P>In the fall of man we see first the divine economy and then the issue of the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Divine Economy</H2><P>It is a marvelous fact that even in the fall of man there was the divine economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God Promising Adam That Christ Would Come<br>as the Seed of Woman to Destroy the Serpent</H2><P>In Genesis 3, after Adam and Eve became poisoned and fallen, they were afraid of God and hid from Him. But God came to seek the fallen and lost man, calling to him and saying, "Where art thou?" (v. 9). After finding the lost and fallen man, God promised that Christ would come as the seed of woman to destroy the serpent, that is, to destroy Satan. Before God made this promise, Adam and Eve must have been trembling in fear. God had told them that if they ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they would die, and they surely must have been expecting to die. But then they heard the good news, the glad tidings, that the seed of the woman&#151;a type or prefigure of Christ&#151;would come to destroy the evil serpent. That certainly was good news. Concerning this good news, Hebrews 2:14 says, "Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil."</P>
