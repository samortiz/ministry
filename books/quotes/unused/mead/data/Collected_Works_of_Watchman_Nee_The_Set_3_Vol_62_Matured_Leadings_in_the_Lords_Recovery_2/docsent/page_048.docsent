   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE OF OUR SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS One Must Be a Regenerated Person</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Chu: How do we exercise ourselves to develop a spiritual consciousness?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Watchman Nee: In order to answer this question we have to come back to the starting point regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose we try to explain the colors white and red to a man who is born blind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may tell him that something that looks white is white or something that looks red is red.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But He will not understand what we are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if the blind man is very intelligent, he will not understand what color is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Intelligence and color are things that belong to two different worlds.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 3 the Lord Jesus said that unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God v. 3 . He meant that in order to know the things of God's kingdom, that is, in order to know the spiritual things, one must be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The things related to God's kingdom, the things of the spirit, cannot be understood by a man of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One can only understand it as his spiritual consciousness develops.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to have spiritual consciousness, one has to begin from regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After a man is regenerated, the Lord plants a spiritual consciousness within him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A Thorough Consecration</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, you must have a thorough consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is what Romans 12:1-2 speaks of in presenting ourselves as a living sacrifice, being transformed by the renewing of the mind, and then proving God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some people are indeed saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact they have been saved for many years already.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we cannot get through with them concerning any spiritual thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are like a piece of wood or stone when it comes to spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They have no spiritual feeling at all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is because they have a problem with their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the church we can find brothers and sisters who experience a sudden opening of their understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we trace the cause of this opening, we will discover that these ones have made a thorough consecration before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To a Christian, consecration is the necessary step after regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can talk to some people about any worldly matter from music to politics to philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They may be good at them all, but when you talk to them about spiritual things, they may not understand anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only spiritual ones can discern spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Worldly wisdom and human cleverness cannot discern spiritual things 1 Cor 2:8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word mind in Romans 12 is nous in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It can be translated as understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Formerly, our spirit was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through the quickening of the Holy Spirit, it is now able to communicate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we still need the renewing of our understanding before we can know the good, well pleasing, and perfect will of God revealed to us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our understanding needs to be renewed all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The spiritual consciousness of the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong is weak because their understanding is not renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please forgive me for saying a frank word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A person is dull in his spiritual consciousness because his understanding is not renewed, and his understanding is not renewed because he has a problem with his consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have not seen a man who is truly and thoroughly consecrated who has a dull spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A thoroughly consecrated person is one who is a living sacrifice all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The stronger the consecration, the more the understanding opens up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only consecration will give the Holy Spirit the proper ground He owns in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once we hold back anything in our consecration, the Holy Spirit is frustrated from gaining the full ground in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, consecration is an indispensable step in removing the negative hindrances.</S>
