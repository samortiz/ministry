   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN THE HIGHEST REVELATION OF CHRIST Psalms 107 to 110 Scripture Reading: Psa 107:31-32; 108:1-3; 109:1, 30; 110:1-7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the end of Book IV we have the consummation, the completion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everything now has been recovered Christ, the house, the city, and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All we need to do is praise.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, Book V, Psalms 107 to 150, indicates how the house and the city of God become the praise, safety, and desire of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, it tells us how Christ will come to reign over the entire earth through the house and the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the first four books of the Psalms, we have Christ, the house, the city, and the earth: now in Book V, the last book, we have the praise, the hallelujahs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Again in Book V, Christ is stressed, not in a deeper way, but rather in a higher way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Book II reveals something of Christ in a deeper way Psalm 45 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But Book V, as we shall see, speaks of Christ in the highest way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Book V emphasizes even more the city of God; it speaks of the city much more than all the other books.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It does not refer much to the house, for ultimately the house will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When our brother John saw the new Jerusalem, he mentioned that he saw no temple in the city Rev 21:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we come to the last book of the Psalms, the temple has all but disappeared; but we do have the city as a high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually and ultimately a local church must become a city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we come to the end, we will praise God for Christ and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Take, for example, the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In retrospect, we did have at the beginning the sense of the reality of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a very real sense the church life was God's house to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then gradually, little by little, something of the city began to come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is still something of the house here, but mainly the church life is as a city now.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates the improvement of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do expect that one day the church in Los Angeles will give everyone the impression that it is a city, the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Book I, as we have seen, there was very little about the city.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Book I we mainly see Christ and the house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then, both in Book II and in Book III, we have the city with the house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Book IV we have something added; we see there the city with the house for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Finally, when we come to Book V, we see very little of the house, but we see much of Christ, revealed in such a high way, with the city to possess the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CHRIST AT GOD'S RIGHT HAND</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now let us consider the first four Psalms of Book V, Psalms 107, 108, 109, and 110.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Psalms 107 and 108, the saints thank and praise God for His care, deliverance, and victory through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Psalm 107:6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Psalm 109, within the saints in their suffering, we have the cry of Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Compare Psalm 109:8 with Acts 1:20.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Psalm 110 we see the answer, God's answer, to Christ's cry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This answer is exceedingly high not deep, but high.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Martin Luther said that this Psalm is the greatest of all the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a sense, I agree with him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It has only seven verses, just as Psalm 87, that wonderful Psalm regarding the city.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Psalm 110, however, is not about the city, but about Christ in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is divided into four sections: 1 the first three verses, 2 verse 4, 3 verses 5 and 6, and 4 verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 1 tells how God makes Christ sit at His right hand: "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool" see Matt 22:42-45; Acts 2:34-36; Eph 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here the title "the Lord" is Jehovah in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This verse has been quoted frequently in the New Testament more than ten times as a direct quotation and another ten times indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All together, there are more than twenty instances in the New Testament where Christ is referred to as sitting at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of course, it was from the time of His ascension that God made Him to sit at His right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is proved by Hebrews 1:3, "When he had by himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is sitting there until God makes His enemies His footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we are still in the period of "until."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are still in the time when God is working to bring all enemies under the feet of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This period is the age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 2: "The Lord shall send the scepter of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We know that this has not yet transpired, but it will come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that when God has secured Zion in a full way, Christ will return.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then, out of Zion, God will send forth the scepter of Christ's power to rule over all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The day will come.</S>
