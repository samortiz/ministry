	 <h2 class="head1">PERFECTING THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
TO TAKE THE BODY AS THEIR PROTECTION</h2>
<p>We have many young people who have a desire to serve full time. The way for us to perfect them is to hand them over to the Body, just as Timothy was handed over to the Body. Then the church in Lystra recommended Timothy and handed him over to the apostle. The way to perfect is clearly presented: the apostle with the elders and the elders in coordination with the apostle were responsible for his perfection. Perfection is by the Body. The Body perfects the young people, and the Body becomes their protection.</p>
<p>The church in Lystra commended Timothy to Paul. Then the elders and Paul laid hands on Timothy, thereby placing him under the care of the church, under the elders. Without the function of the elders, Timothy would not have been fully attached to the Body. Even if Paul had been able to provide him with some perfection by himself, Timothy could have had an improper attitude toward the church and the elders. This shows God&rsquo;s wisdom and the work of the Holy Spirit. Paul did not lay hands on Timothy by himself. If he had done this, his actions would not have been according to the principle of the Body. Rather, he laid hands on Timothy together with the elders of the church. This shows that Timothy was perfected by the apostle with the church and by the church in coordination with the apostle. After Timothy was perfected, he was able to lay hands on others and even to respond properly to accusations against elders. However, he was not proud toward the elders and the church, because the elders had laid hands on him. Such a relationship is crucial.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING FROM OUR HISTORY</h2>
<p>I went to Shanghai in 1946. At the end of the year I moved there and began coordinating with the brothers in the work and in leading the church. At the time there was a group of students who were being perfected under my ministry. In 1949 I moved to Taiwan, and according to the arrangement in the work, this group of young people also came to Taiwan. I now regret that my perfecting work was not as complete as Paul&rsquo;s perfecting work on Timothy. The young people were short of certain elements. The work committed them into my hands for their perfecting, so they came to Taiwan. I assigned three of them to be under the leading of the brothers in Kaohsiung. However, in less than a year the responsible brothers told me that they had no way to lead the young brothers, because they falsely claimed that they had been perfected by Brother Nee. This was not accurate. Brother Nee did not minister for six years, from 1942 to 1948, and the church in Shanghai was restored only after the surrender of Japan in 1946. At that time, we began with about a hundred saints. A year later we began the practice of the whole church preaching the gospel, and hundreds of people were baptized. By the summer of 1947 the church in Shanghai held the bread-breaking meeting in seventeen districts. Therefore, these young people were actually under my perfection.</p>
<p>The church in Shanghai experienced a revival in the spring of 1948. Responsible brothers from the north, the northeast, the interior provinces as far as Hankow, and from the south as far as Kwangchow (Canton) wanted to come to Shanghai to see the revival. However, Brother Nee had not yet resumed his ministry; he was still in Foochow. Therefore, I went to Foochow to help with the resumption of his ministry, and I also accompanied him to Shanghai. In the resumption meetings we enjoyed the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Therefore, Brother Nee decided that those who were present in the meetings should go to Kuling to be in his training, and that I should remain in Shanghai to lead the church. The next year, 1949, the civil war within China became critical, and government agencies were moved from Shanghai to Taiwan. I also came to Taiwan.</p>
<p>This history shows that the young brothers were not led by Brother Nee. Since they were not able to be perfected in the locality where they were, I brought them to Taipei and continued to lead and perfect them. However, I did not follow Paul&rsquo;s example to coordinate with the elders in perfecting them, and they became detached from the church. Eventually, they left even though they were responsible for many service-related functions in the churches. As a result of their pride, they criticized the other co-workers, and we were unable to rescue them.</p>
<p>In 1954 and 1955 some brothers proposed that we invite Brother T. Austin-Sparks to come to Taiwan. He came in 1955 and again in 1957. After his second visit we had problems. As I look back, I see that the source of the problems was a lack in perfecting. This gave ground for pride to take root in those young brothers. Because they were not like Timothy, problems occurred. After Brother Sparks&rsquo;s visit, they began to say that they had seen a glorious vision of the full Christ. This situation caused the greatest wounds in our history in Taiwan. To this day we can still see the tragic result of these divisions in the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We must seriously consider the way to perfect the young people. If there are loopholes in our perfecting, problems will arise. This is similar to cultivating fruit trees in an orchard. If we do not properly cultivate the trees, there will be problems: bugs will eat the leaves and branches, and birds will eat the fruit. Therefore, we need to pay much attention to the perfecting of the young people. The young brothers and sisters have a great future, but if their perfecting is flawed, they will not be safeguarded and protected. If there are loopholes, disasters will be unavoidable. This will damage the future of their whole life.</p>
<p>Problems arose, and I warned the brothers that if they left, they would continually divide among themselves. More than twenty years have passed, and my word has proved true. Among those few brothers, no two are coordinating together; they are all separated from one another. They damaged the Body of Christ and created division. As a result, they are divided, and they are ruined. It is not that they did not have light or that they did not see the church. Their speaking concerning the ground of the church was clear. They know that there is only one Body and that there is only one church in the universe. They know that the expression of the church is in the principle of one church in one city. Today they are in America, but it has been difficult for them to preach the truth there. They may lead some students to salvation, but they cannot speak the truth concerning the church, because they do not have the proper standing.</p>
<p>This can be compared to the difficulty of divorced persons being reconciled with their former spouses. When these brothers were with us, they were &ldquo;married&rdquo; to the church, but now they are &ldquo;divorced&rdquo; from the church. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, some are still willing to read our books; thus, they still have a way to receive some supply. In the early days they declared that they were helped by Brother Sparks to see and know the vision of the full Christ, but now they have nothing. It is a great mistake to be critical of others and to look down on others.</p>
