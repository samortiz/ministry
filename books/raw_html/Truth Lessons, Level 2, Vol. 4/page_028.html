As the Sword for Our Fighting</h2><p>The Spirit is the sword for us to fight against our spiritual enemies, the power of darkness, and the evil things. In Ephesians 6:10-20, concerning the warfare that deals with the spiritual enemies by putting on the whole armor of God, Paul said that we need to receive “the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God” (v. 17). Among the six items of God’s armor, only the sword is for attacking the enemy. Here it shows us that the sword, the Spirit, and the word are one. The word is the Bible. But if this word is only printed letters, it is neither the Spirit nor the sword. When the constant word in the Bible becomes the instant word, this word is the Spirit, who is the sword for slaying the enemy. If we would enjoy the Spirit as the sword for fighting against the enemy, we must come to the word of the Bible, receiving the word of God by means of all prayer. By praying and taking the word of God in this way, we enjoy the Spirit as the sword for fighting to slay all the things that resist us.
