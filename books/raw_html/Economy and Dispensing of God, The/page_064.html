<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Details</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As Members of the Body,<br>Speaking Truth One with Another</H2><P>Now we come to the details of the believers' living. The first point is that as members of the Body, we need to speak truth one with another (v. 25). We should never lie to our fellow members. To lie is absolutely wrong. Any kind of lie, whether wild or cultured, is wrong. Often the highly educated people lie in a cultured way. They hide their lies in a nice cloak. But this is wrong. We should speak only truth with one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Being Angry, but Not Sinning;<br>Not Letting the Sun Go Down on Our Indignation,<br>Neither Giving Place to the Devil</H2><P>We should not let the sun go down on our indignation (v. 26). We should not "lose" to the sunset, but should "beat" the sunset by letting our indignation go before the sun sets. Furthermore, we should never give place to the devil (v. 27). If we do not let our anger go, but rather keep our anger, we will give the devil a place. In our marriage, a little anger is like a little kindling. But if we do not quench it, it will bring in a big fire that can burn our entire marriage.</P><P>The same thing is true in the church life. As Christians, we meet together often. It is very easy for us to offend one another. We need to let these offenses go. Anger that is due to offenses is very damaging to us. It is even damaging to our stomach; we may develop an ulcer because of it. If we let go of our anger before the sun goes down, we will be free and will be able to sing and praise the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Not Stealing, but Laboring,<br>Working with Our Own Hands</H2><P>The third point is that we should not steal (v. 28). We may think that we have never stolen, but actually, everyone steals. Whether we are a gentleman or a lady, a boy or a girl, in God's eyes we have all stolen from others. A teacher may bring home a piece of chalk from school, and a worker may bring home some things from his office. We may say that this is not stealing; but in God's eyes, this is stealing. All young girls have stolen from their mothers. If we check with ourselves, we will find that there are many different kinds of stealings in us. But we should steal no more.</P>
