   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that the living overcomers, who have been purchased from among men and who followed the Lamb absolutely, will be raptured to God s temple in the heavens before the rapture of the majority of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One hundred and forty-four thousand in verse 1 is an actual number but with a symbolic meaning: it has a spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One hundred and forty-four thousand is one thousand multiplied by twelve times twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Twelve is the number of completion in God s eternal administration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One hundred and forty-four 21:17 is twelve times twelve, which signifies the completion of completions, the ultimate completion in the fullest way.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows the difference between the man-child in Revelation 12 and the firstfruits in chapter 14.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The man-child is for fighting and for defeating Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the man-child deals with the enemy.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The enemy, the devil, must be cast down from heaven by the man-child, who will execute God s judgment over the enemy.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God and Christ desire to taste some firstfruits for Their satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we realize this, we will desire to ripen earlier for the satisfaction of God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the attitude of the living overcomers, the earliest ones of God s crop to mature, those who satisfy the hunger and thirst of God the Father and of the Lamb, the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before the Great Tribulation</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The reason one is taken and one is left is that there is a difference between them in the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The growth in life unto maturity makes the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who are mature will be taken, raptured, before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who are immature will be left to pass through the great tribulation, which will be a severe trial upon the whole inhabited earth Rev 3:10 and a snare that comes suddenly upon all those dwelling on the face of the earth Luke 21:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The rapture of the overcoming believers will occur secretly, even unexpectedly, and it will be in different places and at different times.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, we need to be watchful and take heed of our growth in life because we do not know on what day our Lord comes.</S>
