   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT A SPECIAL TALK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON HANDING ONESELF OVER Date:Evening, February 2, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The following hymn was written about a person, Dara, whose heart was most sincere and whose spirit was most pure towards the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It speaks of the proper attitude a man of God should have towards the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we sing this song, we touch a spirit whose purity rarely has been found in the past five hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we learn to touch the Lord's Spirit with our spirit and as we turn our heart fully to the Lord as the writer did, we can lay aside every earthly possession.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Having seen the world's fair beauty,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, I would be blind once more,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lest I lose the loving Presence</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And Delight I knew before.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Having seen the world's fair beauty,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, I would be blind once more,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lest I lose the loving Presence</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And Delight I knew before.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I can see in paradise,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But while here on earth His mercy</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For my blindness will suffice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I no more would be delivered</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From my thorn, but look for grace,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While within the veil His glory</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Shineth brightly on my face.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the deep dark night, His beauty</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I by faith, not sight, may trace;</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was ridiculed and hated,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet I see His glorious face.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sun and moonlight far surpassing,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Clouds and Milky Way o'erspread,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Is the glory all transcending</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Shining from His thorn-crowned head.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Five or six hundred years ago, there was a person by the name of Miss Bride who was greatly used by the Lord to perform miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She laid hands on Dara, and the little sister, who was born blind and who was then in her teens, recovered her sight.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After Miss Bride prayed for her, her eyes were opened and everything around was new to her.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She was very happy and greatly enjoyed the sight of the sun, the moon, the stars, and everything around her.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After a few days, however, she went back to Miss Bride in great sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Miss Bride asked her what she wanted, she said she wanted someone to pray for her again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Miss Bride asked, "Do you have some other illness?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She answered, "Please pray for me to have my eyes blind again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The beautiful scenery is distracting me from the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later Miss Bride put Dara's words together in a poem and composed the above song.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can see that this is a song from the heart of one who is absolutely single for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It shows us the kind of attitude such a person has towards the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Tonight we want to talk about the matter of handing oneself over.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to serve the Lord, we have to hand ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First, we have to see the meaning of handing oneself over.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Next, we need to see what we should do after we have handed ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before this, however, let us first talk about the loss and recovery of the truth concerning handing oneself over.</S>
