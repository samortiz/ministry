<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST<br />
AND SECOND CHRONICLES</h1>
<h1 class="msg">MESSAGE TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SUPPLEMENT TO THE HISTORY<br />
OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Chron. 29:3&mdash;32:8; 33:11-17; 34:3-7; 36:20b-23</h1>
<p>In previous messages we covered nine kings of Judah who are examples regarding the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s good land, which is a type of the all-inclusive Christ. In this message we will consider three more kings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. OF HEZEKIAH</h2>
<p>In 29:3&mdash;32:8 we have an account of the reign of Hezekiah. He was one of the best kings. But even with Hezekiah there was a hidden defect. This defect is not mentioned in 2 Chronicles, but it is exposed in 2 Kings and in Isaiah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Restoring the House of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Hezekiah restored the house of Jehovah and brought out the impurity (things related to idol worship) from the holy place (29:3-36). This was a great thing. The house of God, the temple of God, was the place for His elect to worship Him. But before Hezekiah came into his reign, Israelites put idols into that temple, and in verse 5 these idols are called &ldquo;the impurity.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Charging the Levites and the Priests<br />
to Sanctify the House of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Hezekiah charged the Levites and the priests to sanctify the house of Jehovah (vv. 4-11). His charge indicates that after the devastation of the temple, the priests and the Levites were left with nothing to do. Hezekiah charged them to remove from the eyes of the holy God all the idols, all the things of impurity. In verse 11 he said to them, &ldquo;My sons, do not now be negligent, for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before Him to minister to Him and to be His ministers and burn incense.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Levites and the Priests<br />
Doing It according to Hezekiah&rsquo;s Charge</h2>
<p>The Levites and the priests did the work of cleansing the temple according to Hezekiah&rsquo;s charge (vv. 12-19).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Hezekiah and the Leaders of the City<br />
Worshipping God in the House of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Hezekiah and the leaders of the city worshipped God in the house of Jehovah (vv. 20-30). This indicates that the temple of God had been left to the idols and that in it there was not the worship of God. Hezekiah took the lead along with the leaders of the city to worship God in the house of Jehovah. In addition, they offered the burnt offering and the sin offering to God with the praising of God by the instruments made by David and with the words of David and Asaph. The burnt offering was for God&rsquo;s satisfaction, and the sin offering was for the forgiveness of their sins.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Charging the Assembly of the People<br />
to Offer Sacrifices and Thank Offerings to God</h2>
<p>Hezekiah charged the assembly of the people to offer sacrifices and thank offerings to God, and all the people did it with rejoicing over what God had prepared for them (vv. 31-36). This was a great restoration, a great revival.</p>
