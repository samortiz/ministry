<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>PORTIONS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT<br>REVEALING THE DIVINE TRINITY<br>IN THE DIVINE MOVE AND<br>IN OUR EXPERIENCE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:14-19; 4:4-6; 5:19-20; 6:10-11, 17; 1 John 4:2; 1 Peter 4:14; 2 Cor. 13:14; Jude 20-21; 2 Thes. 2:13-14; Rev. 1:4-5; 22:1-2</H1><P>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning portions in the New Testament revealing the Divine Trinity in the divine move and in our experience. Most of these portions are very deep. In Ephesians 3 Paul speaks of the breadth, length, height, and depth of Christ (v. 18). Our fellowship here concerning the Divine Trinity is in the direction of His depth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EPHESIANS 3:14-19</H2><P>Ephesians 3:14-19 reveals the apostle praying to the Father; the Father strengthening the believers through the Spirit; Christ making His home in the believers' hearts; and the believers' being rooted and grounded in love, apprehending the dimensions of Christ, and knowing the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ to be filled unto all the fullness of [the Triune] God. In Ephesians 1 Paul prayed that God would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we might know Him and His economy (v. 17). He prayed that we would have the ability, the power, to see the spiritual revelation. In chapter one his prayer is for our seeing the vision, but in chapter three his prayer is for our experience of the depths of Christ.</P><P>First, Paul prayed to the Father as the source. Then the Father strengthens the believers through the Spirit as the means, the channel. Then Christ moves and works to make His home in the believers' hearts. Eventually, the issue of the moving of the Father and the Spirit, and of the Son making His home in our hearts is the fullness of the Triune God. The Father is the source, the Spirit is the means, the Son is the object, and the fullness of the Triune God is the issue.</P><P>The source is the Father, the means is the Spirit, and the aim, the goal, is the Son because the Son is the center. Whatever the Triune God does is for the Son as the center, out of the Father as the source, and through the Spirit as the means. Paul prayed to the Father as the source, asking the Father to strengthen the believers through the channel of the Spirit that a goal might be reached. The goal was that Christ would make His home in the hearts of the believers.</P>
