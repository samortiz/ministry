   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I have the burden to share concerning the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is difficult for the saints to be clear about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christians may talk about spirituality, the Body, and the building, but hardly anyone knows where to build.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not even the outstanding Christian teachers know where to build.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE NEED FOR THE PROPER GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let me relate a true story that illustrates this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many of you are familiar with the books of Jessie Penn-Lewis on the subjective work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Anyone who knows the Lord's recovery will admit that her messages on the subjective work of the cross were part of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before Mrs. Penn-Lewis was raised up by the Lord, not many Christians knew the subjective aspect of the Lord's cross clearly and adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A young Baptist pastor who had been somewhat influenced by modernistic teachings was made clear regarding the Lord's salvation through Mrs. Penn-Lewis's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later he became a co-worker with her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, this young pastor saw something beyond what Mrs. Penn-Lewis had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She had seen the subjective aspect of the cross, but he saw the principles of resurrection for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What he saw was very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was something about which others had had no concept.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This young man worked together with Mrs. Penn-Lewis for some years, always considering her as his senior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the day came when he could no longer work with her, and he left.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the one work became two, the way of Mrs. Penn-Lewis and the way of this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He himself told me the story in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This story indicates that two spiritual persons who had seen something of so-called spirituality did not see the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Neither of them had any ground for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis was suspended in the air and so was this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some time later I spent more than a month having fellowship with this brother day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every contact between us lasted two or three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I eventually learned that he had no intention of knowing this matter of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He simply would not give any heart, mind, or spirit to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, he was utterly closed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For more than thirty days I tried to convince him regarding the ground of the church, and he tried to convince me to abandon it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When he found that I would not leave it and when I learned that he had no intention of accepting it, we inwardly said good-bye to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That was the end of our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This took place approximately twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This illustration shows that if we do not have a definite site for building, yet we begin the work of building, we are doing something ridiculous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How ridiculous it is to prepare the materials for building and to begin the work of building, yet not to know the site of the building!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nothing is more foolish than this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, many Christians today are just this foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We, however, need to be sober and to consider whose Christian work has the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may ask whether or not the Baptist denomination has a ground.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yes, it has a definite ground, but the ground is wrong, because the Baptist Church takes as its ground baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the ground upon which the Baptist denomination is built.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Presbyterian denomination takes as its ground the presbytery.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This ground, which is also divisive, is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I know of some cases of Presbyterian pastors who were immersed by Baptists in order to become the pastors of Baptist churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every denomination has a ground, but the ground is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today nearly all Christian workers are building on the wrong ground.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, there is no genuine building whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead of unity, there are many divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Bible it is clearly revealed that we Christians should be corporate and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But can you show me where the genuine building is today?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It can hardly be found anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today's Christians have truckloads of building materials, but they are driving around looking for a place to unload them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sometimes they unload the materials on the wrong site, and after a period of time they shift the materials to still another ground.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the actual situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I would ask you to check with the missionaries, the Christian workers, and those in the Navigators, Campus Crusade, and Inter-Varsity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In 1963 and 1964 I met a leader of a certain Christian work in Phoenix.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the campuses they were bringing a good number of young people to the Lord, but the young people then went to the denominations and became dead.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, some in this work recognized the need for the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At that time the book The Normal Christian Church Life had just been published in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To a certain extent, these brothers agreed with it and were considering the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But they did not dare to take this step, for they realized that the denominations would withdraw their financial support if they were to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Deep within them, these leaders realized that their work had no ground.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But because they feared the loss of financial support, they would not dare to practice the church life.</S>
