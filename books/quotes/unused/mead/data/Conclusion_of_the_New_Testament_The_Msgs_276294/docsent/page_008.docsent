   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 3:30 John the Baptist said, He must increase, but I must decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The increase and the decrease depend on who has the following.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For Christ to increase and for John the Baptist to decrease means that John had to withdraw from the scene and from having a following; he had to allow Christ to be the only figure on the scene and to have all the following.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ increases Himself by speaking God s word to spread God and by giving the Spirit of God to be the reality of what He has spoken in order to dispense the eternal life into people, making them Godkind, the children of God, the species of God, the family of God, to be Christ s increase.</S>
