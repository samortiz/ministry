   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible reveals that the Son is called the Father Isa 9:6 and that He is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Consider the revelation of the Triune God in chapter fourteen of John.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 8 Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apparently surprised at Philip s request, the Lord Jesus answered, Am I so long a time with you, and you have not know Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How is it that you say, Show us the Father? v. 9 . Then the Lord went on to say, Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? Here the Lord seems to be saying, Philip, have I been with you so long and still you don t know Me? Don t you realize that when you see Me, you see the Father? I am one with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apart from Me and outside of Me, there is not such a Person called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isaiah 9:6 says, For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to this verse, the Son given to us is called the everlasting Father, or the Father of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not long ago a certain preacher said that the Father in Isaiah 9:6 is merely similar in meaning to the title father of his country applied to Washington and the father of electricity applied to Edison.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if we accept this kind of understanding, we need to ask of what father is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Isaiah 9:6, He is the Father of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The title Father of eternity actually means the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some versions translate the Hebrew in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Father of eternity means the Father who exists forever, the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The phrase of eternity denotes One who is self-existing and everlasting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the Father of eternity is the Father who is self-existing and everlasting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Who is this Father who is self-existing and everlasting?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are there two such Fathers the Father in the Godhead and another Father who is the Son in Isaiah 9:6?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The answer to this question is that the Father in the Godhead is the Father of eternity, and according to Isaiah 9:6 the Son is also the Father of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are not two divine Fathers!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is only one Father of eternity, the Father who is self-existing and everlasting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the Lord Jesus made it clear in John 14 that He and the Father are one, He went on to speak concerning the Spirit as another Comforter: And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, this other Comforter is the Lord Himself in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First He was the Comforter in the form of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then He became another Comforter as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This Comforter is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to John 14:17, the Spirit of reality will not only be among the disciples, but will also be within them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In John 14:20 the Lord Jesus went on to say, In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The day spoken of here is the day of the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here the Lord seems to be saying, In that day you will know that I am in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then you will no longer ask Me to show you the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Realizing that I am the Father, you will also know that you are in Me and that I am in you as the Spirit is in you v. 17 . This is possible because I am also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the Lord were not the Spirit, how could we be in Him, and how could He be in us?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If He were not the Spirit, we could not enter into Him, and He could not enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this, the Lord must be the Spirit, the holy pneuma, the heavenly air.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because He is the Spirit, the pneuma, the air, He can be in us, and we can be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The disciples came to know this on the day of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On that day they knew that He was in the Father, that they were in Him, and that He was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord s words in John 14 indicate that the Three of the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is confirmed by the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First Corinthians 15:45 says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that the Lord Jesus as the last Adam in the flesh has become a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, in 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul declares, Now the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
