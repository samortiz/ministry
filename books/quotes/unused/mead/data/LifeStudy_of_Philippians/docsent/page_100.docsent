   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE LIVING CHRIST BY RECEIVING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21a; 2:12b-13a, 16a; John 1:1; 6:63; Eph 6:17b-18a; 5:18-20; Heb 4:12; Col 3:16-17; 2 Tim 3:16a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1:19-21a we have salvation, the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the magnifying of Christ, and the living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 2:12, 13a, and 16a we have the matters of working out our own salvation, of God operating in us, and of holding forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In these two portions of Philippians we have two lines: the first line is salvation, the Spirit, and Christ; the second line is salvation, God, and the word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This comparison is quite revealing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>EXPERIENCING SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1:19 Paul says that his situation, environment, and surroundings will turn out to him for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in 2:12 he charges us to work out our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Paul s word in 1:19, the difficult situations we face can turn out to our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether or not our circumstances turn out for us to salvation depends on whether or not we enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not enjoy this bountiful supply, our circumstances will turn out to be for shame.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every situation we face will turn out either for salvation or shame.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose, for example, a brother s wife gives him a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the brother this situation can be either a salvation or a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It all depends on whether or not he enjoys the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If he enjoys the supply of the Spirit, he will experience an instant salvation, and Christ will be magnified in him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If he does not enjoy the supply, but becomes angry with his wife, he will be put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I repeat, if the brother s situation with his wife turns out to be for his salvation, Christ will be magnified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a very real sense, the salvation in 1:19 is Christ magnified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 2:12 Paul again speaks of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This time, however, he does not speak of his salvation, but charges the saints to work out their own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Concerning himself, Paul says that his circumstances will turn out for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But concerning the saints, he tells them that they must work out their own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the problems we face day by day, especially in our family life and in the church life, we need God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need different kinds of salvation for different kinds of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A brother needs one kind of salvation in his dealings with all the different saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But he needs another kind of salvation in his relationship with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to God s ordination, it is not good for a man to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every brother should have a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, in married life problems are unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For all these problems we need God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God ordained marriage so that we might have the opportunity to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we enjoy the Lord, we shall experience His salvation in our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s salvation as revealed in the Bible is of many categories.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Day by day and even moment by moment we may experience different aspects of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, and even moment by moment we need to experience salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I simply cannot live without God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>SAVED FROM MURMURINGS AND REASONINGS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Paul tells us to work out our own salvation, he is not speaking of salvation from hell nor salvation from God s condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are not able to work out that kind of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Notice that Paul tells the saints to work out your own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A husband should not pay attention to the salvation needed by his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, he should concentrate on working out his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul s word about working out our own salvation should be considered in relation to his charge concerning murmurings and reasonings in verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this verse he says, Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we have pointed out previously, murmurings are related to the emotions, and reasonings, to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, sisters in particular have a problem with murmurings, whereas brothers are troubled by reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have never heard of a wife who did not murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A sister needs to work out her own salvation with respect to her murmurings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She needs salvation from murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Likewise, the brothers need to work out their own salvation with respect to reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If our married life and church life are filled with murmurings and reasonings, this is proof that we are lacking God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our family life and our church life should be full of salvation and without any murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How marvelous it would be if in the church in our locality there were no murmurings or reasonings, but an abundance of salvation!</S>
