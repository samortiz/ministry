   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul and Barnabas Spoke</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Peter finished, all the attendants were silent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At that juncture Paul and Barnabas related all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them 15:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Finally James Made the Decision</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Finally James stood up and spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And when they finished speaking, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me v. 13 . In verse 19, James gave the conference a final verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this conference, the first group s speaking was a kind of preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These were the Jewish brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then Peter spoke, followed by Paul and Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lastly, James made the final decision.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Application of Acts 15</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can apply this pattern to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A decision is not made according to the opinion of the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, when the church comes together, all the brothers and sisters can speak and debate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end, the elders make a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the final decision is made, all the brothers can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter could speak.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul and Barnabas could also speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When James spoke, a final decision was reached.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Question Facing Us Today: Who Is James?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our question today is: Who is James?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, who today has the qualification to stand in the leading position to make the final decision?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, we must consider how James became the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will then know how spiritual leaders are produced in general.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Bible, six Jameses are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The James in the conference in Acts 15 was the brother in the flesh of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He spoke a few times in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The New Testament mentions his name ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the beginning of the church life, the leading one was Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He took the lead to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Later, Peter and John went down to Samaria 8:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peter also went to the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the house of Cornelius, seemingly Peter gradually lost his leading position in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Acts 12 the church experienced great persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One of the twelve apostles, another James, was killed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Peter was imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was at that juncture that James rose up, and Peter lost his leading position.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here we see that spiritual leadership is not a matter of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not like political elections in the world where a president may be elected for a term of six years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, it is a matter of learning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whoever learns more before the Lord and advances more takes the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 1 Corinthians 15:5-7 Paul spoke of many persons.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But he only mentioned the names of James and Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For the others, he only said five hundred brothers, the twelve, and all the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even the name of John was not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means there must have been something special about James.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the only reason Paul could have mentioned him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Galatians 1:18-19, Paul only mentioned the names of two apostles: Peter and James the brother of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 2:9 Paul said again that James, Peter, and John were three pillars in the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He placed James before Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 2:12 Paul said, Some came from James to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He did not say some came from Jerusalem or from Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Acts 12:17 Peter also told the others to inform James of what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At this time there were a few dozen co-workers in Jerusalem and tens of thousands of brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But Peter emphatically said to inform James.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From the above verses we can see that at the beginning of the church life in Jerusalem, Peter was the first leader.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But after Peter was imprisoned, James rose up, even to the point of replacing Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This shows us the reason James was the last one to speak in Acts 15.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The one who made the final decision in this conference was James, because at that time he was the spiritual leader.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Decision of the Spiritual Leader</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Being the Decision of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In verse 19 James made the decision: Therefore I judge that...</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then in verse 28 he said, For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This opinion was actually James s decision.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the end it became the decision of the Holy Spirit in conjunction with the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we see that the decision of the spiritual leader is the decision of the Holy Spirit.</S>
