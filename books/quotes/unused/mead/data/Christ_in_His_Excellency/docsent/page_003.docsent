   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BIBLICAL REVELATION OF THE EXCELLENT CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to testify to you that I was saved before reaching the age of twenty, and now I am nearly eighty; in these nearly sixty years, I have been reading the Bible almost every day and have worn out several Chinese Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have been in America for twenty-two years, and I have also worn out several English Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In my study I have more than forty different English versions of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now I have been working together with some brothers on the Recovery Version of the New Testament in English, and for each book I have spent at least several months writing the footnotes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to write the footnotes, I needed to read the works of many people and check with the authoritative references.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After studying the Bible in this fine and detailed way for many years, I confess that the Bible is truly the Book of books.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why in English it is called "The Book," meaning that the Bible is the unique book, the book over all other books.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This Bible is truly very precious!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may illustrate the preciousness of the Bible in the following way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have been with the American brothers for twenty-two years, and they have often said, "Brother Lee, no matter which book of the Bible you take up, after you have written some footnotes and explained the verses in a training, that book becomes a new book."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once they said, "We used to think that there was nothing in 1 and 2 Peter and that these Epistles were very dry and boring to read, but since your recent speaking, 1 and 2 Peter have become rich and fresh, full of revelation and light."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They also said to me, "In the past almost no one liked to read Exodus, but ever since you released the messages in the Life-study of Exodus, everyone feels that this book is truly precious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We see that the entire book of Exodus is full of the riches and revelations of Christ that bring us into the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is truly very precious."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let me give you another example.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1975 when I covered the Gospel of John in Washington, DC, I gave thirty messages, and later I gave tens of other supplementary messages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, now the printed Life-study of John has fifty-one messages.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Recently, however, I have had a burden to come back to speak on the essence of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Gospel of John is simply inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The biblical revelation of the Lord Jesus is very mysterious and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No wonder Paul said, "What things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord" Phil 3:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE SURPASSINGNESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this message we will look at ten major points concerning the surpassingness of Christ based on the verses in the Scripture reading above.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A. Christ Being the Son of the Living God</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matthew 16:16 says, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus Christ is surpassing because He is the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The living God means that God not only has life, but He also moves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God moves in the universe, so He is the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. Christ Being the Lord of All</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Acts 10:36 says, "The word which He sent in announcing the gospel of peace through Jesus Christ this One is Lord of all ."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word all actually includes all people, matters, and things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus is the Lord of all people, matters, and things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many times I preached the gospel based on this verse of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In mainland China I said that everything has its owner, master, and lord; there is nothing in the universe that is without a lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Who then is your lord?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may say that your parents are your lord, but when you grow up, your parents can no longer be the lord over you; in the end your parents will become dependent on you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The wives may say, "Our husbands are our lords."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, when your husbands get sick, they have to depend on you and can no longer be your lords.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then who is really our Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only the Lord Jesus is our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is truly marvelous that those who believe in any religion do not say that they believe in a lord; only those who believe in the Lord Jesus say that they have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is because only the Lord Jesus is the Lord in the universe; no one else is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May I ask you who the Lord in the universe is?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Heaven and earth are so great and we humans are so meaningful, yet can you say that we do not have an owner?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do have an owner; Jesus is our Owner.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all belong to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only what He says counts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As parents, children, husbands, and wives, we all rely on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He truly is surpassing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>None of the great philosophers, anywhere and at any time, such as Confucius, Socrates, and Plato, ever dared to call himself Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the contrary, Confucius only said, "He who offends heaven cannot pray."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His word indicated that he was not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But the Lord Jesus said, "I am the light of the world"; "I am the life"; I am the door"; and "I am the way."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No other person has said these words.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Over the past two thousand years everyone believes these great words spoken by the Lord Jesus because these are true words.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Jesus is Lord; He is the Lord of all.</S>
