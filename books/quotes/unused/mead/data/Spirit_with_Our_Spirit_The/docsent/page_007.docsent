   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man's Spirit Is Distinct from His Soul</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible reveals that man's spirit is distinct from his soul Heb 4:12; 1 Thes 5:23a .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our experience also tells us this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to our mind, we may feel to buy something.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may really like it and desire to have it according to our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we may decide to get it according to our will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, our mind thinks about it in a good way, our emotion loves it, and our will determines to get it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At this juncture, however, there is something else deep within that tells us not to get it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is our spirit, the deepest and inmost part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the distinction between the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The highest part, the high peak, the highlight, of a man is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The lowest part, the meanest part, is the body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In between, in the middle, is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you live by your body, you become a low person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you live by your spirit, you become the highest person, a person of the highest grade.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Or you may be in the middle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may be quite logical, knowledgeable, and reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is to live according to your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You are neither low nor high; you are in the middle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you live by the body, you live like a beast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you live by the spirit, you are a genuine saint.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every believer should be a saint who lives by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if you live by the soul, you are merely a gentleman, like a disciple of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are very logical, reasonable, and full of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A gentleman is a logical and reasonable man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you lose your temper without limitation by the desire and lust of the flesh, of the body, you are like a beast.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When you are losing your temper and restrict it by your logic and reason, you are a gentleman in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you restrict your temper by exercising the spirit, you are a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. God Is Spirit for Man</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>to Contact Him and Receive Him</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is Spirit for man to contact Him and receive Him into man, and man has a spirit for man to contact God and contain God that God and man may have an organic union John 4:24; 1 John 4:13; 2 Tim 4:22a; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God were not the Spirit, He could not contact us, and we could not contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God the Father is the source; God the Son is the course; and God the Spirit is the flow to reach us 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the Spirit is the reaching of the Divine Trinity to man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God reaches us in the Son as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ephesians 2:18 says, "For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit is the access for us to contact God, receive God, and contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is so that we and God may have an organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our union with God is not like the union in today's American labor unions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That union is in an organizational and coexisting way, but our union with God is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is a union not only of coexistence but also of coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today we are coinhering with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He lives in us, and we live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In John 15 the Lord said, "Abide in Me and I in you" v. 4a . First John 4:15 and 16 speak of God abiding in us and us in God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a mutual abiding, and this mutual abiding is coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is only after being regenerated to have God in us as our life and nature that we are in union with God organically.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This union is a coinherence, a mutual abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the Bible's revelation concerning God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all have to know Him and know ourselves to such an extent.</S>
