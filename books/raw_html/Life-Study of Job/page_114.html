<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Psalms Being a Book of Mixtures</H2><P>The Psalms is a book of mixtures. Some of the prayers in this book are high, but other prayers are quite low.</P><P>In Psalm 1 there is a certain amount of seeking after God, but it is a seeking after God in His law. In Psalm 2, on the contrary, we have the praise of Christ and the unveiling of Christ. In Psalm 1 the psalmist was seeking after God, yet he did not seek God directly, but made the law of God the goal of his seeking. However, in Psalms 2, 8, and 16 the psalmists were directly seeking God Himself. In Psalm 36 the psalmist was clear that the object of his seeking should be God Himself in His house. Such a seeking cannot be found in the book of Job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In a Great Part Being Mixed<br>with the Psalmists' Expressions<br>of Their Mixed Sentiments</H2><P>In a great part the book of the Psalms is mixed with the psalmists' expressions of their mixed sentiments according to their natural concepts concerning the psalmists' relationship with God, with men, and with their enemies. This part corresponds with the record of Job and may be considered a continuation of Job in the style of human expressions of human sentiments in human views and concepts. In this matter, Job and the Psalms are like two brothers who closely resemble each other.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In a Significant Part<br>Being Mixed with the Divine Revelations<br>of Christ with God in His House and in His City</H2><P>In a significant part the book of Psalms is mixed with the divine revelations of Christ with God in His house (temple) and in His city (Jerusalem). This part should be taken as the highest divine revelation in the Old Testament concerning Christ as the centrality and universality of God's economy, which is strongly stressed by Christ Himself in Luke 24:44 and by the apostle Paul in Hebrews 1:5-13 and 10:5-7.</P>
