   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIGNS OF THE APOSTLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 12 Paul goes on to say, Indeed, the signs of the apostle were wrought among you in all endurance, by signs and wonders and works of power.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The signs are attesting miracles that furnish credentials of apostleship, the wonders are startling and awakening miracles, and the works of power are miracles that demonstrate God s power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that the expression the signs of the apostle was used first by the Corinthians, not by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps the believers at Corinth were discussing the matter of the signs of an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They may have asked themselves what were the signs of Paul s being an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If they had not raised this question, Paul would not have mentioned it here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The expression the signs of the apostle may sound strange to us, but it did not seem strange to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the contrary, this expression was familiar to them, since they were probably the ones who invented it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some of them may have thought that the Judaizers had more of these signs than Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was the reason in verse 12 Paul speaks of the signs of his apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Regarding the signs of the apostle, the first thing Paul mentions is all endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that endurance is the leading sign of an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With respect to the Corinthians, Paul endured defamation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some of them went so far as to say that Paul was crafty and with guile took advantage of them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul uses the word guile in verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a note on this verse in his New Translation, Darby points out, The apostle is not saying that he did this, but is answering a charge that he had kept up appearances by taking nothing himself, but knew how to indemnify himself by using Titus in order to receive from them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The charge was false, as he proceeds to show.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Corinthians were saying that Paul would not come to Corinth to collect money himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, he sent Titus to do this for him and thereby used Titus to cover himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is hard to believe that certain of the Corinthians would defame Paul to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we can understand why Paul emphasizes the matter of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 12:12 Paul seems to be saying to the Corinthians, You ask me to tell you the signs of my apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first sign is my endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have criticized me and defamed me, but I have been able to endure it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then Paul goes on to mention signs, wonders, and works of power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are miraculous things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But according to the context, although Paul speaks of these things, he does not emphasize them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, Paul seems to say, You talk about miracles as signs of apostleship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I was with you, there were many signs, wonders, and works of power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But instead of emphasizing such things, I would first speak of my endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>NOT TREATED AS INFERIOR</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 13 Paul continues, For what is it in which you were treated in an inferior manner to the rest of the churches, except that I myself was not an encumbrance to you?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Forgive me this injustice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church at Corinth was not treated as inferior to the other churches or weaker than they.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After pointing this out, Paul says, ironically, Forgive me this injustice, referring to not being an encumbrance to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 13 Paul seems to be saying, In the matter of receiving gifts, grace, and God s blessing, you Corinthians are not inferior to other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I begot you in Christ, and I did my best to raise you as a church that was not short of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I did not treat you in a manner inferior to the rest of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I did my best to beget you in Christ, to raise you up as a church, and to build you up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Regarding God s salvation and blessing, divine grace, and spiritual gifts, you are not inferior to any other church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In what way, then, were you treated in an inferior way?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only in that I was not an encumbrance to you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I did not burden you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Forgive me this injustice!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was a shame to the Corinthians that Paul had to speak this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The only thing he failed to do for them was to make himself a burden to them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Elsewhere Paul even says that he took wages from other churches in order to work among the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although Paul worked for the Corinthians, they did not give him anything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, his only injustice toward them was not placing any burden on them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 13 is not a pleasant word, but Paul was nonetheless bold in saying it.</S>
