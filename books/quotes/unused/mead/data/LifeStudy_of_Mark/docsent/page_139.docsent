   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MISTREATED BY MAN AND JUDGED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 29 through 31 tell us that those passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Come down from the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes, mocking with one another, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who blasphemed the Lord Jesus twisted His word, You destroy this temple, in John 2:19.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who blasphemed Him also said that He saved others, but could not save Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the Lord had saved Himself, He could not have saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to 15:33, And when the sixth hour had come, darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sixth hour is our twelve noon, and the ninth is our three o clock.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord was crucified beginning from the third hour, our nine o clock.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was suffering on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the first three hours, He was persecuted by men for doing God s will; in the last three hours, He was judged by God for the accomplishment of our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was during this time that God counted Him as our suffering Substitute for sin Isa 53:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, darkness came over all the land because our sin and sins and all negative things were dealt with there, and God forsook Him v. 34 because of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 15:16-32 we see how the Slave-Savior was mistreated by man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was mocked, beaten, blasphemed, and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All these were actions of His persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 33 says that at the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At exactly noontime darkness came over the whole land and remained until the ninth hour, until three o clock.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This darkness was caused by God, and it was an indication that God had come in to judge the One who was hanging on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have seen that the Slave-Savior was on the cross for six hours, from nine o clock until three o clock.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first three hours were the time of man s persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may say that during those hours the Lord Jesus was a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then at noon, with darkness coming upon the whole land, God came in. This darkness was a sign of God s judgment of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whereas man persecuted the Slave-Savior during the first three hours of His crucifixion, God came in during the second three hours to judge Christ as our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was in these hours that God put all our sins upon Him and considered Him a sinner as our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, during the first three hours of His crucifixion, the Lord Jesus was a martyr.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But during the second three hours, He was the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a martyr He suffered persecution under the hand of man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As our Redeemer He suffered judgment for us under the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The darkness was a symbol that God had come in to judge Christ as our Substitute for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Mark 15:34 says, At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners 1 Pet 3:18 , bearing our sins 1 Pet 2:24; Isa 53:6 , and being made sin for us 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We shall consider this verse in more detail in the following message.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verses 35 and 36 continue, And some of those standing by heard it and said, Behold, he is calling Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And someone ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting it on a reed, gave it to Him to drink, saying, Let him be, let us see if Elijah comes to take him down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This vinegar was offered to the Lord for quenching His thirst John 19:28-30 , but it was offered in a mocking way Luke 23:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The wine mingled with gall and myrrh, in Matthew 27:34 and Mark 15:23, was offered to the Lord before His crucifixion as a stupefying draught, which He would not drink.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the vinegar in Mark 15:36 was offered to Him at the end of His crucifixion in a mocking way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 37 goes on to say, But Jesus, letting out a loud cry, expired.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that the Lord stopped breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Matthew 27:50 tells us that at this point the Lord cried out with a loud voice and dismissed the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This meant the Lord gave up His spirit John 19:30 , indicating that the Lord voluntarily yielded up His life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE VEIL OF THE TEMPLE TORN IN TWO</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the Lord Jesus expired, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom 15:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This signifies that the separation between God and man was abolished because the flesh signified by the veil of sin taken by Christ Rom 8:3 had been crucified Heb 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The fact that the veil was torn from the top to the bottom indicates that the rending of the veil was God s doing from above.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The temple was twenty cubits high.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It would have been impossible for man to tear the veil from the top to the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was God who rent that veil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The veil in the temple was a sign of the flesh Christ had put upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The tearing of the veil signifies that the humanity taken on by Christ had been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we study the Bible carefully, we shall realize that cherubim were embroidered on the veil, and cherubim are signs of God s creatures Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>1:4-14; Rev 4:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, the cherubim on the veil signify that the creatures were related to the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the Lord put on our humanity, He put on a humanity that bore the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This gives us a strong basis to say that when Christ crucified His humanity, He terminated the creatures.</S>
