   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I would advise all of you here, whether you are an elder, a co-worker, or a full-timer, that if you want to take the new way today, you must give yourselves to it.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You must risk all for this.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Otherwise, it is better for you not to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I came back in 1984 to take the lead to practice the new way, I was risking all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time I had served the Lord for over fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I cannot claim to have accomplished very much, but I must say that I have done something.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I took the risk to come back to Taiwan for this work, and I have encountered much opposition and attack.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet I have been at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nothing can deter me or frustrate me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have given my all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No matter how people slandered me or opposed me, I was not shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I advise you that if you want to take the new way, you must give yourselves to it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I must remind you of another thing: never bring in the way you learned to serve the Lord in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That would make you one who takes the new way, but with the old method.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you want to take the new way, you must go all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you do not understand something, you must study and learn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is worthwhile even to fast and lose sleep because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This past Lord's Day I went to one meeting hall for a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I looked into the situation there, and I found out that every one of the saints there was produced by this way of giving oneself to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During the past two or three years, every year they have realized a one hundred percent increase.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I heard their testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every one of them was sincere and genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My point is that you cannot practice the new way with the old way anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must learn to start from the most basic step, and you must pick up the points one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, I cannot say that I am very experienced in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But by the Lord's mercy, I always know what I should say at any given time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe the subject I have chosen for today, "Distinctive Virtues of an Elder," is the need in Taiwan today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some of you have been serving the Lord here for decades.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You think that you know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But where is the result?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not be offended by me; this is my word of exhortation in love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have not seen any result in the new way because you have not given yourself to it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I advise you not to dabble any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, you will spoil others as well as yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you do it, give yourself to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you are not for it, simply reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am not being rude to you; I am merely trying to stir you up a little.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Dear ones, I hope that you will receive my sober words.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By the grace of God, may we rise up to take the new way, learning step by step and going on step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Take, for example, the matter of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, we do not need to knock on "cold" doors; there are many "warm" doors.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every brother or sister has at least twenty gospel friends, either their unsaved relatives, their friends, or their neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not have to take care of them all by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some relatives have heard our preaching for years and are still not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This may change if someone else preaches to them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some may get saved in just this kind of way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In nourishing the new ones after they are saved, we should not use the old methods.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must learn to be new.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the past, we have been affected too much by tradition and natural concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have not followed the Spirit very much.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The proper way for us to help people is not to solve their problems, but to lead them to call, "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That is all that is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As long as a person touches the Lord and enjoys Him, all his problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must believe that the Lord in whom we believe is real and living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this reason, we should not work according to our old methods anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That way is not effective.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must practice strictly according to the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the reason we must strive, struggle, and wrestle.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Strictly speaking, we cannot consider ourselves as having accomplished anything yet.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are still in the process of learning.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must learn diligently and in a desperate way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Please believe my word: anyone who is willing to give himself to learn will become an expert in the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Ability comes from learning.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I believe all of you are for the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But it is not enough just to be for the new way; we must all be diligent, laboring, striving, and struggling to give ourselves to practice the new way.</S>
