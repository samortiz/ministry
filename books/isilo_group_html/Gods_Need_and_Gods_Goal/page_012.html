CAUSING PEOPLE TO GROW IN LIFE</h2>
<p>It is difficult for some to understand these situations. When a brother who loves the Lord marries a sister who loves the Lord, there can still be problems, and when a spiritual sister marries a spiritual brother, there also can be problems. Sometimes there is no problem with the brother and the sister, but their children grow up loving the world more than the Lord. Even when children love the Lord just as their parents do, this positive situation may not last long, because accidents and even death can occur. We have seen many situations like this in the past twenty to thirty years, and it was difficult for us to understand and comprehend the Lord&rsquo;s way. However, now we can stand before the Lord and say that God&rsquo;s thoughts are not our thoughts and that His ways are higher than our ways (Isa. 55:8-9). We should remember that God has arranged systems in the universe that do not follow a straight line; rather, these systems involve ups and downs. Autumn follows spring, and winter follows summer. Night follows day, sorrow follows joy, and death follows life. A straight line is not God&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s way is related to our growth in life. A wife who loves the Lord will have fewer opportunities to grow in life with a husband who loves the Lord than she will with a husband who does not love the Lord as much. Children who are disobedient cause their parents to grow in life more than children who love the Lord. If there is birth but no death, there will be little growth, and if there is day but no night, there also will be little growth.</p>
<p>Many animals and plants need overcast and rainy days as well as sunny days; they need night as well as day; they need winter as well as summer. I have lived in Southeast Asia for extended periods of time, and it is accurate to say that the food produced in a hot climate is not as tasty as our food. Their chickens and ducks and even their eggs are not as tasty as ours, and their fish are not of equal quality to ours because they have a summer climate all year. There are no cold days. Every day is a hot day, and the constant heat makes people miserable. Living things cannot flourish without cold weather. With hot and cold days and even daytime as well as nighttime temperatures, every living thing grows better. Even among the human race, people with smart minds and strong character are associated more with places that have variable seasons. This is God&rsquo;s arrangement.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FALLING ALSO BEING ACCORDING TO GOD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>If human life involved only birth but no death, only joy without sorrow, people would not experience much growth. A person who can stand without ever falling will not have much depth. Those who are deep in the Lord are the ones who have fallen the most. Hearing this, some may say, &ldquo;Is this not the doctrine of doing evil that good may come, as in Romans 3:8? Are you encouraging us to fall?&rdquo; Although I wish that we all would fall so that we could grow, I am not saying that we should do evil that good may come. I often tell people that falling is not an easy matter. In fact, it is even more difficult to fall than it is to stand.</p>
<p>However, when God allows us to fall, we will have no way to escape; we will fall. David was very pious and spiritual in his living before the Lord. When we read the psalms that he wrote, we can see that he was a person who lived in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. However, he did not know himself, and one day the Lord seemingly said, &ldquo;Do you think that you are pious? Do you think that you are spiritual? You need to see your real condition.&rdquo; As soon as God withdrew His hand, David fell; he had Uriah killed and took his wife, committing a great sin (2 Sam. 11:14-27; 12:9). When David was about to sin, God could have moved His finger just slightly, and David would have been preserved from committing these sins. However, instead of preserving David, God allowed him to fall and go through a dark night.</p>
<p>We should not have the thought that it is difficult for a Christian to stand. Rather, we should realize that it is even more difficult for a Christian to fall. Even though some may say, &ldquo;It is very easy for us to fall,&rdquo; we could not fall even if we wanted to without God allowing it. The only reason we can fall is that God is willing to allow us to fall into a trial that exposes our weaknesses.</p>
<p>A person who has not fallen once after his salvation does not have a strong experience of salvation and is not very deep in spiritual life. Such a person may not have fallen, but he is not truly standing either. At the most he is lying down. A person who is lying down can never fall. It is still possible to have an outward appearance of being an active Christian, because even people who are lying down can still roll around on the ground. Other Christians may not be lying down, but they are still merely sitting; consequently, it is not easy for them to fall either. The people who fall most easily are those who are not only standing but even more who are walking and running. Those who follow the Lord intensely will fall the most, and the more intensely a person runs, the more serious will be his falls.</p>
<p>Some may say that it is not a good thing to fall, but falling is very beneficial. Anyone who has not fallen is not deep in the Lord. Those who are deep in the Lord are those who have fallen and risen numerous times. Their spiritual life involves both days and nights, springs and autumns, summers and winters, and sunny days and cloudy days. In their living there are risings and fallings. As such, their living is in the hand of God, who has no intention for them to remain on a straight path.</p>
<p>Some may say that this is a dangerous way to speak. However, it is not dangerous in any way. Without the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we could not rise up even if we wanted to, and without the Lord&rsquo;s willingness, we could not fall even if we wanted to. Those with sufficient experience will worship the Lord and bow down to Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, You have the authority over death and life. You have separated day from night. You have led me with Your light during the day, but You have also led me through darkness. Everything is of You. You have been present throughout the entire course of my life.&rdquo; Jacob, in his old age, had this view, and at the end of his days he worshipped God, leaning on the top of his staff and speaking of Him as &ldquo;the God who has shepherded me all my life to this day&rdquo; (Heb. 11:21; Gen. 48:15). Jacob&rsquo;s staff was not a proof of his shepherding of others but of Jacob&rsquo;s being shepherded by God. God&rsquo;s hand is supporting me; when I fall, I am still in His hand. He leads me in every circumstance, whether it is a rising or a falling. He is my Shepherd.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WORSHIPPING GOD AND ACKNOWLEDGING<br />
THAT EVERYTHING IS OF GOD</h2>
<p>If we have fallen, we should not be too sorrowful; rather, we should worship God. If we are able to stand, we should not be proud; rather, we should worship God. We should realize that the fall that one person experiences today may be our experience tomorrow (Gal. 6:1; 1 Cor. 10:12), and the stand that one person experiences today may be our experience tomorrow. We may be standing when another falls. However, it is quite possible that when he rises up, we may fall. God gives us a night when we ask Him for a day; He gives us a day when we are at ease with our night. God gives us situations that are contrary to our preferences in order to work Himself into us. Our thoughts are focused on a straight path, but His thoughts include ups and downs. Our expectations are based on the thought of a straight path, but God&rsquo;s principles, ways, and methods involve curves.</p>
<p>We are in God&rsquo;s hand; we did not determine the date of our birth or the time of our salvation. Consequently, we should not assume that the path ahead of us is in our hands. There is no need to be overly discouraged or sorrowful, much less boastful or proud, because everything is in His hand. He will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and He will have compassion on whomever He will have compassion (Rom. 9:15). He will visit whomever He will. He often comes to people in the dark of a &ldquo;night,&rdquo; and He often meets people when their &ldquo;sky&rdquo; is cloudy and overcast. We touch Him more when we are suffering, and we grow more when we are in distress.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may increasingly worship Him, submit to Him, and trust in Him. May we not be proud but humble, bowing down to Him, worshipping Him, and praising Him. When we stand, may we acknowledge His grace, and when we fall, may we receive His dealing. May we see His considerations when our circumstances are smooth, and may we realize His special visitation when our circumstances are difficult. He wants to lead us to walk on a way that is more difficult but also deeper, a way that often is beyond our understanding. Nevertheless, we need not be fearful or anxious, and it is foolish to be boastful or proud. Those who have spiritual light will not be discouraged or proud, much less compare themselves with others, because they realize that everything is in God&rsquo;s hand. God gives life and allows death; He both exalts people and brings people low (Matt. 23:11; James 4:10; 1 Pet. 5:6); He causes people to ascend and to descend (Eph. 4:9); He leads people to a bright day and also leads them to a dark night; He provides smooth circumstances and adverse situations (Psa. 23:2, 4). This is a law in the universe and in spiritual matters.</p>
<p>Through these changing circumstances we grow by being broken and delivered from the self. When we are reduced, He is enlarged. When we decrease, He increases (John 3:30). Regardless of how much we change, the intention behind His hand never changes. No matter how He deals with us, either by touching or by seemingly not touching us, His hand upon us has a consistent purpose from beginning to end; that is, He wants to work in us to the extent that we will be filled with all that He is.</p>
<p>No matter whether we have fallen or have stood in the past, we should worship God. We need to prostrate ourselves before Him, confess that we are untrustworthy, and acknowledge that His grace is upon us. We need to ask God to open our eyes so that we may know His ways and so that our thoughts may be adjusted.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>God's Need and God's Goal &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
