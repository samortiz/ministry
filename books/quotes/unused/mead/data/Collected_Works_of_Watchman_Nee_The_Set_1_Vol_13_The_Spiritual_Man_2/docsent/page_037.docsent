   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If our conscience frequently testifies of God's pleasure, then when we unfortunately fail, we will trust more boldly in the blood of the Lord Jesus to wash us again.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we desire to have a conscience void of offense, we should not depart for a moment from the blood that washes us eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not depart, because we often give opportunities for offenses in the conscience in small matters, even if we have not slipped in great matters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, confessing sins and trusting in the precious blood should not be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since our sinful nature and its many hidden works are still within us, we may possibly have to wait for our spiritual life to grow more before we can know them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why there are many things which we now consider to be wrong, but which we once felt were not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If it were not for the precious blood covering everything, we would never be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once the precious blood has been sprinkled upon our conscience, it functions there continually because of the intercession of the Lord Jesus and the eternal life He gave us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The apostle told us that he entreated that he would have a conscience void of offense before God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two matters, towards God and towards man, are intimately connected together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we wish to have a conscience void of offense towards man, we must first have a conscience void of offense towards God, because a conscience that has an offense before God naturally has an offense before man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, all believers who seek after a spiritual living should continually seek after a good conscience before God 1 Pet 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This does not mean that our condition before man is unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We not only have to seek for a good conscience towards God, we also have to seek for a good conscience towards man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many things are acceptable before God but are not proper before man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only a conscience that is clear before men has a good testimony before them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even if someone misunderstands, you should have a "good conscience, so that in the matter in which you are spoken against, those who revile your good manner of life in Christ may be put to shame" v. 16 . Once the conscience is unclear, then no matter how good your outward conduct is, it is of no use; once your conscience is without offense, it cannot be affected even by men's slandering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A conscience without offense not only is able to testify for us before man, but it also enables us to receive God's promises.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today's believers often complain that their faith is too small and therefore, that they are unable to have a completely spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Naturally, there may be many causes, but is not an offense in the conscience one of the most important causes?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A conscience without offense and a faith that is strong are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The moment the conscience has an offense, faith is immediately weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us see how the Holy Bible links these two matters together: "Love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith" 1 Tim 1:5 , and "holding faith and a good conscience" v. 19 . The conscience is the faculty of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God hates sin the most.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The zenith of God's glory is His boundless holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His holiness cannot tolerate sin even momentarily.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a believer does not follow the guidance of his conscience, but rather prefers whatever is not according to the will of God, he will immediately lose his fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It can be said that all the spiritual promises in the Bible given by God to the believers are conditional.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>None of them are given to the believer to satisfy the intentions of his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If sins and the flesh are not removed, then neither the Holy Spirit, nor fellowship with God, nor answers to prayers will be granted to the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If our conscience has already accused us, how can we boldly approach God to seek for His promises?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If our conscience is unable to testify that we live on the earth according to the holiness and righteousness of God, how can we be men of prayer who seek for God's unlimited free gifts?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If our conscience rebukes us the moment we lift up our hands to God, then what is the use of our prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our sins must be rejected and washed away before we can have the faith to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The conscience must be void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This does not mean that it should be better than in the past or that many evil things have been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Being void of offense, having no offense whatever, and being completely without fear before God are the necessary conditions of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are willing to submit to the conscience and let it reprove us, and if we fully consecrate ourselves to the Lord and are willing to do all of His will, our boldness will certainly increase, knowing that a pure conscience can be attained.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We would then be able to tell God that we have not held anything back, that there is nothing that is not open to Him, that we have no hidden things, and that there is no more separation between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In living according to the spirit, a believer should never allow his conscience to be unclear in any small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everything that is condemned by the conscience should be rejected at once and confessions made immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The believer should seek for the cleansing of the blood immediately and allow no trace of this matter to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every day he should seek for a conscience that is continually clear, because a conscience that is unclear, for no matter how short a time, will cause the spirit to suffer a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The apostle's example is "to always have a conscience without offense."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this manner, we will see that our fellowship with God is truly unbroken.</S>
