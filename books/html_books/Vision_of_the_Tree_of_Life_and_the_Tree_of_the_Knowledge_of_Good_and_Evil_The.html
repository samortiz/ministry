<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of six messages given by Brother Witness Lee in co-workers&rsquo; meetings held in Taipei in 1958, following a conference on how to enjoy God. The messages of that conference have been published in <em>How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God.</em> These messages were originally published in 1958 in <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em></p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TREE OF LIFE BEING<br />
THE CONTROLLING VISION OF THE BIBLE</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation. These four chapters present an important vision. Regrettably, most people do not see the vision contained in these chapters. Many books that expound the Bible have been written, but it is difficult to find a book concerning the vision in these four chapters of the Bible. In other words, the vision in these four chapters has been hidden and closed to man for almost two thousand years.</p>
<p>Once, in a meeting we said that the tree of life signifies God coming to be man&rsquo;s life. A Western missionary who had labored in China for many years was present in that meeting. She told me that she had never heard anyone say this and that she had never read this in a book. For two thousand years chapters 1 and 2 of Genesis and chapters 21 and 22 of Revelation have been closed to man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING AND ENDING CHAPTERS<br />
OF THE BIBLE BEING CONNECTED</h2>
<p>What is presented at the beginning and the end of the Bible? If we have received revelation from the Lord, we will know that the first two chapters of Genesis are consistent with the last two chapters of Revelation. We can also know that from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 there is a big &ldquo;detour.&rdquo; We can illustrate this with a line. The first segment of the line represents the first two chapters of Genesis, and the following segment represents the last two chapters of Revelation. These two segments should form one straight line. However, beginning from Genesis 3 the line veers off and does not become straight again until after Revelation 20. Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 is a detour. The first two chapters of Genesis should have been connected directly to the last two chapters of Revelation.</p>
<p>An example of a big detour is the journey of the children of Israel from Egypt into Canaan. The children of Israel could have entered Canaan after they left Egypt. However, because of their evil heart of unbelief at Kadesh-barnea, they made a detour that lasted for almost forty years (Deut. 1:19-40; Num. 14:1-3, 26-34). The extra time that they spent in the wilderness was a detour. Similarly, there is a detour in the Bible, beginning in Genesis 3 and continuing to Revelation 20. It is difficult to find a spiritual book concerning the beginning and ending chapters of the Bible. Most books cover the content of Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 and hence concern only the detour. Many believers are at a loss concerning the first two chapters of the Bible, and they are not clear concerning the last two chapters. It is hard to find a book in Christianity concerning these four chapters of the Bible. Hence, here we will consider the revelation contained in these four chapters of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PLAN AND ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOD&rsquo;S WORK<br />
BEING IN THESE FOUR CHAPTERS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The revelation in the beginning two chapters and the ending two chapters of the Bible is extremely important. The vision of God&rsquo;s plan and the accomplishment of His plan in the universe are contained in these four chapters. We may have read the first two chapters of Genesis, but we may not be clear concerning the focus of these two chapters. Most theologians and Bible scholars say that these two chapters concern creation. If God opens our eyes, we will see that these two chapters do not emphasize creation. The first two chapters of Genesis are concerning four things: life, image, dominion, and a bride. Among these four items life is the unique cause; the remaining three items are the issue of life. God&rsquo;s entering into man to be life brings in three issues. First, life causes man to have God&rsquo;s image in order to be like God; second, life subjects man to God&rsquo;s authority so that man can have dominion for God; third, life makes man God&rsquo;s counterpart, God&rsquo;s bride, to be joined to God (1:26-28; 2:18, 21-24). This is the revelation contained in the first two chapters of Genesis.</p>
<p>The first two chapters of Genesis are a picture that portrays God&rsquo;s intention. If we would receive light and look at this picture with a sober mind, we will understand that God&rsquo;s intention is to be man&rsquo;s food in order to enter into man and be man&rsquo;s life. This is indicated by God&rsquo;s putting Adam in front of the tree of life (2:8-9). Man will experience three issues when he is mingled with God. Man will have God&rsquo;s image to be God&rsquo;s expression. Man will be the means by which God has dominion on the earth; he will be subject to God&rsquo;s dominion and will be able to represent God&rsquo;s dominion. Man will also become God&rsquo;s bride to be out of God, unto God, and joined to God. This is the revelation presented in the first two chapters of Genesis. If a person sees only God&rsquo;s creation of the heavens, the earth, all things, and man in these two chapters, he sees only the background, not the main object. A painting has both a main object and a background. The purpose of the background is to bring out the main object. However, people often pay attention to the background while neglecting the main object.</p>
<p>The first two chapters of Genesis contain many details concerning creation. These details are a background for the main object, which is the divine life. God created all things in order to gain a realm, and He created man in order to gain a corporate vessel. God wants to enter into man as food in order to be man&rsquo;s life and constituent so that man may be transformed in nature. This is indicated by the precious materials in the river that went forth from Eden (2:10-12). Thus, man will possess God&rsquo;s image to express God, and man will be subject to God&rsquo;s authority to be a means for God to have dominion. Furthermore, man will be God&rsquo;s counterpart to be joined to God. This is indicated by Eve being Adam&rsquo;s counterpart (vv. 22-23). This vision concerning God&rsquo;s eternal intention is revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis. The picture portrayed in these two chapters shows what God wants to accomplish in the universe. Hence, these two chapters can be considered as a blueprint, or plan, that God will fulfill.</p>
<p>In the first verse of chapter 3 God&rsquo;s adversary, Satan, came in to frustrate God&rsquo;s plan by bringing sin into man, the vessel that God intended to use. Thus, beginning from chapter 3 there is a detour in which Satan, sin, the world, the lust of the flesh, and negative things come in. Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 is a detour that includes Satan, sin, the world, and the flesh. At the end of Revelation God comes in to judge Satan, sin, the world, and the flesh; He also judges the issue of these four items&mdash;death (20:14). When these problems are solved, the whole universe is restored. Ultimately, in the last two chapters of Revelation there is a holy city, New Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb (21:2, 9). This city is joined to God as one in Christ and is full of God&rsquo;s image, shining forth God&rsquo;s glory and light (vv. 10-11, 23).</p>
<p>In the city is the throne of God and of the Lamb. The city is under God&rsquo;s dominion and thus is the means by which God exercises His dominion. The river of water of life proceeds out of the throne, and on both sides of the river grows the tree of life (22:1-2). In the New Jerusalem God has accomplished the plan that is revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis. His original plan will be worked out. The life of God is the intrinsic factor of the New Jerusalem. This life is always flowing, and it issues in a group of people who are full of God&rsquo;s image to be His corporate expression and who are under His throne to be the means by which He exercises dominion. These people are also God&rsquo;s counterpart; they are out of God, unto God, and joined to God.</p>
<p>We must see that the first two chapters and the last two chapters of the Bible are the main line of the Bible; the rest of the chapters are the secondary line. Satan initiated the secondary line and brought in sin, which produced the flesh and the world. The final result of Satan, sin, the flesh, and the world is death. Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 is mainly concerning these five matters. Satan, sin, the flesh, the world, and death are frustrations to the Lord&rsquo;s work in the universe that He created, and God is using various means to deal with them. The lengthy portion from Genesis 3 to Revelation 20 concerns the history of God&rsquo;s fight with Satan, sin, the flesh, the world, and death. These five matters have been causing trouble in God&rsquo;s universe and frustrating God&rsquo;s plan, but God has not given up. At the end of the Bible God deals with these five things: He judges the world, the flesh, sin, and Satan and destroys death. Then the detour ends, and God&rsquo;s plan is accomplished.</p>
<p>For two thousand years few in Christianity have remained on the main line. Most Christians have focused on the things in the detour. Few have touched the main items of God&rsquo;s plan. Most people gloss over the items in first two chapters of Genesis but talk at length concerning the items in chapter 3, such as how Satan came in, how man sinned and fell, how man became flesh, and how God accomplished redemption. Concerning the book of Revelation, most Christians pay attention to the seven seals, the seven trumpets, the seven bowls, the great tribulation, and the second coming of the Lord Jesus, but they do not touch the last two chapters in depth. Christians have a clear view of the things in the detour and talk much about them, because the stories in the detour correspond to their human concepts. However, they do not have a clear view of the revelation in the beginning and the ending chapters of the Bible, because these four chapters are concerning God&rsquo;s eternal intention, which is not according to human concepts.</p><h2 class="head1">THE VISION IN THE FIRST AND LAST CHAPTERS<br />
OF THE BIBLE<br />
BEING OPENED TO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Over the past few years the Lord has gradually been revealing to His church the vision in the first and last chapters of the Bible. We have been &ldquo;imprisoned&rdquo; by this vision; God wants to show us only this matter. When I muse upon God&rsquo;s Word, I always come to the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation. We are not proud, but God has indeed opened these four chapters to us. We cannot say that we have not seen this vision. These four chapters of the Bible are shining brightly. Hence, we have no need to remain on the detour. For two thousand years the church has been on the detour and has wasted much time. In this last age God is bringing us back to the main line. We need to lead people according to God&rsquo;s plan so that they may contact and enjoy God as life and also build up the church. As long as God&rsquo;s life is operating in people, it will produce glorious results.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING GOVERNED BY THE VISION<br />
OF THE TREE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>If we see the vision of the tree of life and are governed by this vision when we read the Bible, the Bible will become a new book to us. We will see the central line of the Bible and will discover that the Bible is concerning God being life. Even in the Old Testament there are many portions concerning God being life. For example, Psalm 34:8 says, &ldquo;Taste and see that Jehovah is good,&rdquo; and Psalm 36:8 says, &ldquo;They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Psalm 23 is a description of God being man&rsquo;s life. Many people have expounded on this psalm, but few have pointed out that there is a blessing in this psalm and that this blessing is God Himself. However, we know that the green pastures and the waters are God Himself (v. 2) and that both righteousness and the paths are God (v. 3). We also know that we may walk through the valley of the shadow of death, but God Himself is with us (v. 4). The table that we enjoy is God, the oil is God, and God is the blessing in the overflowing cup (v. 5). He is our goodness and lovingkindness, and He is also the house in which we dwell (v. 6). All the items in this psalm are God.</p>
<p>We can say this because of what the Lord Jesus said in John 10. In verse 11 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.&rdquo; In verse 10 He said, &ldquo;I have come that they [men] may have life and may have it abundantly.&rdquo; Thus, all the blessings that the Lord as the Shepherd gives to man depend on His becoming man&rsquo;s life. Hence, the edible pastures, the drinkable waters, the paths of righteousness, the table spread before us in the presence of our adversaries, the oil on our head, the cup that runs over, goodness and lovingkindness, and the house of Jehovah are all God Himself. This exposition of the Bible is under the governing vision of the first two chapters of Genesis. Some may think that this is a different kind of exposition, but such an exposition is the only correct exposition of the Bible. Psalm 27 is also concerning God being our life. Here David says, &ldquo;Jehovah is my light and my salvation&rdquo; (v. 1). David does not say, &ldquo;Jehovah gave me light and gave me salvation&rdquo;; he says, &ldquo;Jehovah is my light and my salvation.&rdquo; These psalms indicate that the psalmists enjoyed God in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the psalmists spoke according to the vision in the first two chapters of Genesis and knew that God is food to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>The New Testament also speaks concerning God becoming man&rsquo;s enjoyment. In 1 Peter 2:2-3 Peter charges the believers, &ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, if you have tasted that the Lord is good.&rdquo; In 1 Corinthians 1:9 Paul says that the saints are called through God &ldquo;into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; In verse 2 Paul says that Christ &ldquo;is theirs and ours,&rdquo; indicating that Christ is for us to enjoy.</p>
<p>In the four Gospels the Lord said numerous times that He is our enjoyment. In John 6:57 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; A person lives because of what he eats. The Lord is our food; hence, when we eat Him, we will live because of Him. When the Lord established His supper, He took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body.&rdquo; Then He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26-28). These verses show that true remembrance of the Lord is to eat and drink Him.</p>
<p>Most saints think that to remember the Lord is to consider the Lord with the mind; they do not know how to eat and drink the Lord. In the bread-breaking meeting the saints often consider the Lord&rsquo;s life and pray, &ldquo;Lord, You were on the throne, but one day You became flesh and were born in a manger. Your path was from Bethlehem to Galilee, to Jerusalem, and finally to Golgotha, where You were crucified. On the third day You rose from the dead and appeared to the disciples for forty days to speak to them concerning the kingdom of God. Then You were lifted up into heaven from the Mount of Olives. You are now at the right hand of God interceding for us, and in the future You will bring us into glory.&rdquo; Such prayers are no different in nature from the way most people remember the deeds of their ancestors. In Luke 22, however, the Lord took a loaf and gave thanks, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and charged them, saying, &ldquo;This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me&rdquo; (v. 19). Hence, only eating and drinking the Lord are the proper way to remember Him.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING DEALT WITH THE PROBLEMS IN MAN</h2>
<p>If we truly see this vision, our understanding of the Bible will change, and our condition before the Lord will also change. We will set aside many items associated with the detour, which we have paid attention to in the past, and we will come to the tree of life to enjoy God. However, some may say that we need to deal with Satan, sin, the flesh, and the world because they entered into man and have become problems in man. It is true that man fell and has many problems, but God has already dealt with these problems. God entered into man through incarnation, and He dealt with Satan, sin, the flesh, and the world through crucifixion. The Lord then rose from the dead and was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit. As a result, when a person obtains the Spirit, he immediately obtains everything that the Lord has passed through; such a person does not need to deal with Satan, sin, the flesh, or the world. As long as we enjoy the Lord and absorb Him, we will be in an organic union with Him. In this union the flesh is crucified, and sin and the world are dealt with. In this union we experience the glorious facts of death, resurrection, man entering into God, and man being joined to God. We do not need to deal with anything, because God has passed through the detour for us. Thus, we do not need to pass through the detour for ourselves; we simply accept everything that God has accomplished.</p>
<p>Many believers, including Mrs. Jesse Penn-Lewis, were not clear concerning what God has accomplished; therefore, they encouraged others to take a difficult detour of dying with the Lord. This is truly difficult because no matter how much man tries, he cannot die. In fact, the more he tries to die, the more alive and miserable he is (Rom. 7:19-20, 24). There is no need to endeavor or to struggle to experience our co-crucifixion with the Lord. For example, in demolishing a house, it would be laborious and exhausting to tear it down one brick at a time, but if we could drop a bomb on the house, it would be reduced to ashes. Similarly, in dealing with negative things, such as Satan, sin, the flesh, and the world, a clear vision of what the Lord has passed through is like a bomb. It solves all our problems, requiring nothing further from us.</p>
<p>We have experienced failure when we endeavor and struggle to live the Christian life. However, when we fellowship with the Lord, enjoy Him, and let Him fill us instead of making determinations to endeavor and struggle, there is a spontaneous outcome. For example, a sister who hears a message on humility realizes that humility is a Christian virtue and then desires to be humble. She, therefore, prays to the Lord for humility, determines to be humble, and pursues humility. Nevertheless, no matter how much effort she exerts, she cannot be humble. However, there may be another sister who has not heard a message on humility, has made no determination to be humble, and is not struggling to be humble. Rather, she lives in the Lord daily by eating, drinking, and enjoying Him. As a result, she is a very humble sister. She does not feel that she is humble, but all who contact her sense that she is very humble. She does not have a desire to be humble, but she has the reality of being humble, for her humility is God Himself who has filled her. This is also true concerning the experience of our co-crucifixion with the Lord. We must see that in the Spirit of resurrection there is the element of death, because the Lord has passed through death. As long as we enjoy the Lord, we will experience our co-crucifixion with Him. The Lord did not only become flesh; He died, resurrected, and was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit. Hence, the elements of incarnation, death, and resurrection are in the Spirit. We need only to enjoy Him, and we will have all these elements.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly emphasized that the fact of our co-crucifixion in Romans 6 can be gained only in the Spirit of life in chapter 8. Reckoning ourselves as dead is ineffective, for such reckoning is but outward behavior that lacks the inward reality of life. However, if we live in the Spirit of life, eat, drink, and enjoy the Lord, and give the Spirit of life absolute freedom in us, the fact of our co-crucifixion with the Lord will be manifested spontaneously in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SHORTCUT BEING TO ENJOY GOD</h2>
<p>We need to see this revelation so that we no longer deal with sin and the flesh in ourselves. Such dealings are a part of the detour from Genesis 3 to Revelation 20. There is a shortcut in front of us, and this shortcut is the Lord Jesus. In John 14:6 He said, &ldquo;I am the way.&rdquo; Through incarnation the Lord entered into man and was joined to man, and through death the Lord dealt with everything that opposes Him. Then He resurrected from the dead, became the life-giving Spirit, and entered into glory in order to enter into man. Hence, we need only to absorb Him and enjoy Him in order to experience our co-crucifixion with the Lord and our living together with the Lord. This is a shortcut.</p>
<p>The problem lies in our not seeing that the Triune God has come to be everything to us. We see doing and working. We see dealing with the flesh and reckoning ourselves as having been crucified with the Lord, but we do not see that God wants to be our life, nor do we see that we need only to enjoy Him. We lack such a vision. Ever since man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the concept of doing and working has been deeply rooted in man. Those without a vision cannot rid themselves of this concept. Even &ldquo;enjoying&rdquo; God is hard work to them: they study how to enjoy God and how to eat and drink God. If we see that God wants to be our life, we will not ask how to eat, drink, or enjoy the Lord; rather, we will eat, drink, and enjoy Him.</p>
<p>The tree of life is sufficient for all our needs. It is the unique base. When this base gains ground in us, we will be God&rsquo;s expression with His image, we will be the means for God to exercise dominion, and we will be joined to God as His counterpart. These are spontaneous issues. The brothers who minister the word in the different localities must avoid the atmosphere of merely teaching and expounding doctrine and of interpreting the Scriptures. Instead, we must learn to bring people to enjoy God, who was incarnated, died, resurrected, became the life-giving Spirit, and entered into us to be our life. If we will enjoy the Lord in such a way, the churches will have a solid and full expression.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD WANTING MAN TO CONTACT<br />
THE TREE OF LIFE<br />
IN ORDER TO ENJOY GOD AS LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAMB IN THE LAST TWO CHAPTERS<br />
OF REVELATION</h2>
<p>The last two chapters of Revelation are a continuation of the first two chapters of Genesis, and many things that transpire between these four chapters are a detour. However, some things in the last two chapters of Revelation are not in the first two chapters of Genesis. These things are associated with the Lamb. The first two chapters of Genesis mainly concern Jehovah God, but the last two chapters of Revelation concern God and the Lamb (21:22-23; 22:1, 3). <em>The Lamb</em> refers to many matters that are not found in the first two chapters of Genesis, such as redemption for man to be justified (Rev. 5:6; 7:14). These matters are not in the first two chapters of Genesis, because sin had not yet come in. In the first two chapters of Genesis, God was pleased with the man whom He had created (1:31), and man did not need redemption or justification. Hence, it was sufficient for the creating God, Jehovah God, to have a relationship with man. However, in the last two chapters of Revelation we see not only Jehovah God but also the Lamb.</p>
<p>We must never consider God and the Lamb to be two separate beings. The throne of God reveals that God and the Lamb are one (5:13; 7:10, 17; 22:1, 3). There is only one throne, and this throne is of God and of the Lamb; there are not two thrones. Just as God and Jehovah are one, so also God and the Lamb are one. The name <em>Jehovah</em> means that the creating God has a relationship with man. However, the reference to God and the Lamb means that the creating God has a relationship with man that includes many matters related to the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESSES OF JESUS CHRIST<br />
BEING IN THE LAMB</h2>
<p>The Lamb includes the processes of Jesus Christ&mdash;from His incarnation to His becoming the Spirit. The seven Spirits in Revelation 5 are the seven eyes of the Lamb (v. 6). This means that the Spirit is related to the Lamb. Everything related to the Spirit is involved with the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Jehovah God<br />
Who Has a Relationship with Man</h2>
<p>The first step of Christ is His being Jehovah God. This involves His having a relationship with man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Incarnation to Be Mingled with Man</h2>
<p>The second step of Christ is His incarnation to be mingled with man and His human living of thirty-three and a half years on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Death</h2>
<p>The third step of Christ is His death. Many things were dealt with through His death. First, He shed His blood to deal with sin, thus removing the record of sin before God (1 Pet. 2:24) and condemning sin through His being judged on the cross (Rom. 8:3). Removing the record of sin by His blood as a ransom is one thing, but condemning sin by His being judged on the cross is another. The record of sin was removed by the ransom of His precious blood, and sin was condemned by His being judged on the cross. Second, His death on the cross dealt with the flesh, lusts, the old man, and the self (Gal. 5:24; Rom. 6:6). These four are inseparable. Third, His death on the cross dealt with Satan (Heb. 2:14). Fourth, Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross dealt with the world (John 12:31; 16:11). Fifth, through His death on the cross, He tasted death on our behalf and dealt with death (Heb. 2:9). His death on the cross dealt with these items for us&mdash;sin, the record of sin, the flesh, lusts, the old man, the self, Satan, the world, and death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Resurrection from the Dead</h2>
<p>The fourth step of Christ is His resurrection from the dead. On the negative side, through His resurrection the Lord was freed from the realm of death, thus overcoming death and swallowing up death. On the positive side, through His resurrection the Lord entered fully into God in His humanity. This resurrection is linked to ascension. When the Lord resurrected, He ascended to the heavens and entered into the heavenly realm as both God and man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Becoming the Spirit and Descending</h2>
<p>The last step of Christ is His becoming the life-giving Spirit and descending. The Spirit entering into man (John 20:22) is the indwelling of the Spirit. The Spirit descending upon man is the outpouring of the Spirit (Acts 2:2-4, 17).</p>
<p>These steps are included in the title <em>the Lamb.</em> Before man fell in the garden of Eden, sin had not come in, man did not have a record of sin before God, Satan had not entered into man, man had not become flesh, the world was not yet, and there was no death. Man did not have these negative problems; instead, there was one positive need&mdash;for God to be mingled with man. In Genesis 3 sin entered into man, man gained a record of sin before God, Satan entered into man, man became flesh, and death entered the world. These negative problems came into being.</p>
<p>If man had eaten of the tree of life and not of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man would have received God, and God&rsquo;s desire would have been accomplished. Created man did not need forgiveness of sins or justification, because there was neither sin nor condemnation. However, after the fall in Genesis 3 man must first be forgiven and justified by the blood of the Lamb in order to receive God, contact God, and enjoy God. Therefore, when the prodigal son returned home, his father told the slaves first to put the best robe on his son and then to prepare the fattened calf for them to eat (Luke 15:22-23). Before man fell, he did not need to put on the robe of righteousness. He needed only to eat, drink, and enjoy God as life. There was no need of forgiveness or justification. But today any sinner who wants to eat, drink, and enjoy God, to touch God as life, must first be forgiven of his sins, justified, and then clothed with the robe of righteousness. Man can eat and be merry with God only after he is clothed with the robe of righteousness. We do not need to deal with the problems of sin, the record of sin, Satan, the flesh, the world, or death, because God became flesh, was crucified, and resurrected from the dead in order to deal with them.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE IN REVELATION 22<br />
CONTAINING THE MANY ELEMENTS OF THE LAMB</h2>
<p>The tree of life in Genesis 2 refers to Jehovah God, but the tree of life in Revelation 22 refers to God and the Lamb. In the first two chapters of Genesis God had not yet become flesh, been crucified, resurrected, or entered into man in order to bring man into God. In the last two chapters of Revelation God had already become flesh, died on the cross, and dealt with every negative problem. Furthermore, He had resurrected from the dead and become the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into man and be mingled with man. Therefore, God at the end of the Bible is different from God at the beginning of the Bible. At the beginning of the Bible He is Jehovah God, and at the end of the Bible He is God and the Lamb.</p>
<p>If man had eaten of the tree of life before the fall, what he enjoyed would not have had the elements for dealing with sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, and death, because these were not yet a problem to man. At that time man needed only to be mingled with God as one for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal intention. The elements within God in the garden of Eden are different from the elements within Him today. God has been incarnated to become a man and crucified to deal with sin, the record of sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, and death. He has also resurrected and walked out from the realm of death. Furthermore, not only has He entered into heaven, but He has also brought humanity into heaven, into God. God became flesh, died, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit. This is the God whom we receive today. All these elements have been compounded into the Spirit to deal with all of our problems. Ever since the fall, man has been complicated with the negative problems of sin, the record of sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, and death. God had to deal with these problems on our behalf in order to accomplish His heart&rsquo;s desire in us. Today the Spirit possesses the necessary elements to deal with these problems.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENJOYMENT OF THE TREE OF LIFE<br />
DEALING WITH PROBLEMS AND<br />
ACCOMPLISHING GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION</h2>
<p>We have many problems, but we do not need to struggle in order to deal with them. We do not need to deal with sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, or death, because the elements that deal with these problems are in God. Whether we desire to overcome sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, or death or to do God&rsquo;s will, we do not need to do anything but enjoy God. When we take God in, the many elements within Him will deal with our problems on the negative side and accomplish His eternal intention on the positive side. His eternal intention is that we would have His image to express Him, be subject to Him in order to exercise His dominion, and be His counterpart to be joined to Him.</p>
<p>Man does not need to do anything. On the negative side, we do not need to deal with sin, the record of sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, and death, and on the positive side, we do not need to struggle in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s intention. Our only need is to eat, drink, and enjoy God. If Adam had eaten of the tree of life in the garden of Eden, God would have operated in Adam and accomplished His eternal heart&rsquo;s desire. Similarly, if we eat, drink, and enjoy God, He will operate in us to overcome sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, and death on the negative side. He will also accomplish His eternal intention; we will have His image, exercise His dominion, and be joined to Him on the positive side.</p>
<p>There is no need for man to work. Everything has been accomplished by God&rsquo;s coming to be man&rsquo;s food. Man did not need to do anything before the fall, nor does he need to do anything after the fall. In order to accomplish God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire before the fall, man needed God to enter into him, to supply him with the divine elements, and thus accomplish God&rsquo;s desire through him. After the fall man still needs God to be his life and life supply in order to deal with the problems of sin, the record of sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, and death and in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, because God possesses the elements to deal with man&rsquo;s problems and to accomplish His intention. Every problem requires man to receive the divine elements by eating, drinking, and enjoying God.</p>
<p>For example, when we are healthy, our need is to eat healthy food. But when we are sick or weak, certain elements need to be added to our food. Some elements kill germs; other elements supply more nutrients. We do not need to kill germs, or make nutrients; our only need is to eat. The food that we eat will operate within us to deal with the germs and supply us with nutrients.</p>
<p>There are two significances to God&rsquo;s giving Himself to man as food. If created man wanted to do God&rsquo;s will and accomplish God&rsquo;s intention, he did not need to do anything but take God as food. Then the elements within God would be the supply within man to accomplish God&rsquo;s intention. Fallen man may have the desire to accomplish God&rsquo;s intention, but he has various problems. We do not need to deal with these problems ourselves, but we need to eat God by taking Him as our food. God now has more elements. Within Him are the elements that can deal with our problems and supply our needs.</p>
<p>Both in dealing with the negative problems and in accomplishing God&rsquo;s eternal intention there is no need for man to work. There is no place for human effort. Everything is dealt with by God&rsquo;s entering into us as food. If we see this vision, we will stop our doing, hate our doing, and condemn our doing. Furthermore, we will worship God, saying, &ldquo;I am an enjoyer. I enjoy God and the Lamb, and I am enjoying God as the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to see the vision of God coming to be our food. On the positive side, we need Him as food to supply us with nutrients. On the negative side, we need Him as food to deal with our problems. The elements within Him are sufficient to meet the positive need and the negative need. Whatever our need may be, God has the elements to supply our need. He also has the elements to deal with any problem. In the garden of Eden He did not have as many elements as He has today; He was merely Jehovah God. Now He is God and the Lamb; He became flesh, passed through death and resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit to enter into man, and brought man into God. These steps are now in the Spirit. Hence, when we contact, absorb, receive, eat, and drink the Spirit, we enjoy Him, and the elements within Him deal with our problems and meet our needs.</p>
<p>If a sister continually prays about dealing with sins, she will not be able to deal with sins. She may continually pray to overcome death, but the more she prays, the deader she will be. She may continually pray about dealing with the world, but the more she prays, the more she will be conquered by the world. Such prayers are ineffective. If she eats, drinks, and enjoys the Lord, He will enter deeper into her to be her supply, and spontaneously her sins and the world will be dealt with, and her death will be changed into life. She will not need to do anything. She may be determined to do God&rsquo;s will and to accomplish His intention, but the more she prays and is determined, the worse her situation becomes. If instead of struggling, she absorbs God more, eats Him more, and drinks Him more, she will give Him more opportunities to enter into her. Then she will spontaneously live out His will. This is not a matter of our working or doing but of God being our food. Our only need is to eat and drink Him.</p>
<p>In John 6:57 the Lord said, &ldquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; For the past two thousand years not many believers have understood this word. This thought is completely different from the natural human concept. If we understand this thought, our natural concepts will disappear. We do not need to determine, struggle, or beseech. We need to see that God has come to be our food for us to enjoy. We have only one need, which is to eat, drink, and enjoy Him.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD DEALING WITH THE TREE<br />
OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</h2>
<p>The first two chapters of Genesis should have been connected directly to the last two chapters of Revelation. But as a result of the fall of man, the Bible makes a detour in Genesis 3 that continues through Revelation 20. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, representing Satan, came in during this detour. Satan came in to tempt man. As a result of the fall, sin entered, man gained a record of sin before God, man became flesh, and death entered into the world. Satan, sin, the record of sin, the flesh, the world, and death have been working to frustrate God and man. Man went astray in Genesis 3. The struggles between God and Satan are in this detour, which is the result of man eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It is not until Revelation 20, when Satan is cast first into the abyss (vv. 2-3) and then into the lake of fire (v. 10) and when death, the last enemy brought in by Satan, is cast into the lake of fire (v. 14), that the tree of knowledge is completely dealt with. The detour is the issue of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This tree came in in Genesis 3 and was dealt with in Revelation 20.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO LONGER TAKING THE DETOUR<br />
OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>We no longer need to follow the detour today, for the Lord has opened the way to the tree of life. However, the condition of most Christians is that they are still in the detour. If we do not have a revelation of the tree of life, we will exhort people saying, &ldquo;Brother, you need to be watchful. Sister, you should be subject to your husband. We must deal with the flesh, accept the breaking, and accept the cross. We need to be like Madame Guyon.&rdquo; Such exhortations are in the detour of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Even Madame Guyon was in this detour. She pursued the Lord and was built up, but eventually God still had to strip everything away. When she was stripped by God, she could say, &ldquo;I am as nothing, and rejoice to be / Emptied, and lost, and swallow&rsquo;d up in Thee&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #546). There is no need for a redundant step. It is better to not build than to build up and then tear down. God stripped her of everything and left only Himself. Therefore, she said that she was lost in Him. However, these words do not hit the mark. Man is not lost in God but mingled with God. By God&rsquo;s mercy Madame Guyon touched this reality, but she did not have sufficient light and did not know the confirming word in the Scriptures.</p>
<p>A person who takes the detour must eventually come out. The detour is about doing things. The Lord has enlightened us to see that we do not need to take this detour. The Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst&rdquo; (John 6:35). He also said, &ldquo;He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing&rdquo; (15:5). These verses reveal that there is no need to stay in the detour. We need only to eat and drink the Lord: &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (6:57). How I wish I could repeat these verses until every believer sees that man needs nothing but to eat and enjoy the Lord. A. B. Simpson said that everything is in Christ and that Christ is everything (<em>Hymns,</em> #513). Healing is Christ, power is Christ, and patience is Christ; everything is Christ. But his words did not yet hit the mark and are not very clear. No one has ever told people, &ldquo;God needs man to eat Him; man needs to eat God.&rdquo; Only this word hits the mark and is clear.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE TELLING US TO CONTACT<br />
THE TREE OF LIFE AND TAKE GOD AS OUR FOOD</h2>
<p>The picture at the beginning of the Bible shows that God has been manifested as food. After man was created, he was put in front of the tree of life, which is the embodiment of God. The fruit of the tree of life as man&rsquo;s food signifies that God came in the form of food to be man&rsquo;s life. However, when God became flesh and lived on the earth, those around Him were filled with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Hence, they only asked what they should do and how they should work (John 6:28). But the Lord Jesus said that He came to be food: He is the bread which came down out of heaven for man to eat (vv. 51, 55, 57-58).</p>
<p>The parables that the Lord Jesus spoke concerning salvation are centered on eating. For example, in Matthew 22 the Lord Jesus spoke of a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son and sent his slaves to call people to eat, saying, &ldquo;My oxen and my fatted cattle have been slain, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast&rdquo; (v. 4). A person goes to such a feast to eat, not to do something. In the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15, the father of the prodigal son said, &ldquo;Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry&rdquo; (v. 23). Before the Lord was crucified, He took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body.&rdquo; And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26-28). This indicates that all the Lord&rsquo;s teachings are centered on His being food for man to eat and drink. Hence, He said, &ldquo;So he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (John 6:57).</p>
<p>In addition, Peter says that we can taste that the Lord is good (1 Pet. 2:3). On the day of Pentecost the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit, but others saw them as being full of new wine (Acts 2:13). Such filling with the Holy Spirit can be considered as drinking; it is a matter of eating and drinking. Paul says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine...but be filled in spirit&rdquo; (Eph. 5:18). In other words, we should no longer drink wine but should instead drink the Spirit. We should not be drunk with wine, but we should be filled with the Spirit. There is no concept of doing or working in these verses. There is no human effort; instead, there is only eating and drinking.</p>
<p>If we do not take God as food and enjoy Him as our life, we will leave the tree of life, for even a little mixture will turn us to the detour. The way of the detour is complicated. This way has everything&mdash;good, bad, right, wrong, the things of God, and the things of Satan. We must see that we do not need to take the detour. We must be people who eat, drink, and enjoy God. This is the straight way. We do not need to think of the problems of sin, the record of sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, or death. We need only to enjoy God. When He is in us, He will deal with all the problems for us. This is the principle of Romans 8: the law of the Spirit of life frees us from the law of sin and of death (v. 2). This law in us is responsible for everything.</p>
<p>The tree of life does not depend on our spiritual cultivation, morning watch, or anything else; it depends on our enjoying God, absorbing Him, eating Him, and drinking Him. The Lord Jesus went through the detour on our behalf to become the life-giving Spirit. Now He contains all the elements that meet our needs. We need only to enjoy Him, appropriate Him, eat Him, drink Him, and live by trusting in Him. Then the problems will be dealt with, and God&rsquo;s intention will be fulfilled.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE BEING TO BRING MAN<br />
BACK TO THE TREE OF LIFE</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the vision in the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation. We will also consider the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE AND<br />
THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL<br />
HAVING A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil have a very important place in the Bible. After man was created, the first things he encountered were these two trees (Gen. 2:7-9). Whether man has life or death depends on these two trees, and the kind of person that he becomes also depends on these two trees. Everything related to man depends on these two trees. In Genesis 2 God wanted man to pay attention to two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (vv. 9, 16-17). God wanted man to receive the tree of life; He did not want man to take of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The first tree is of life; hence, man receives life when he contacts it. Concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, God said, &ldquo;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo; (v. 17). Therefore, one tree issues in life, and the other tree issues in death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE SIGNIFYING<br />
THE GOD WHO IS MINGLED WITH MAN</h2>
<p>If we read the Bible carefully, we will see that the tree of life signifies God coming to be mingled with man, or God mingled with man. God is life, but His being life is not for Himself; His being life is for man. In relation to Himself, God does not need to say that He is life. It is only in relation to man that He says He is life. God&rsquo;s being life does not refer to His existence but to His having a relationship with man. God&rsquo;s relationship with man is a relationship of life; God wants to be man&rsquo;s life. The important point in God&rsquo;s being life is not that He is His own life but that He would be man&rsquo;s life. God wants to be mingled with man to become man&rsquo;s life, because life is an indispensable element within man. To man, God should be his life. God wants to work Himself in a definite and thorough way into man; He wants to enter into man and be assimilated by man to become man&rsquo;s inward element.</p>
<p>From Genesis 2 to Revelation 21 there are many portions on the orthodox relationship between God and man. These portions emphasize God&rsquo;s entering into man to be man&rsquo;s enjoyment and becoming man&rsquo;s inward element, man&rsquo;s life. For example, Psalm 36:8-9 says, &ldquo;They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures. / For with You is the fountain of life.&rdquo; In these verses the fountain and the river of pleasures are the same. With God, it is the fountain, but when it flows out, it is the river of pleasures. As believers, we drink of the water of life, which has its source in God. This shows how God becomes the intrinsic element of life within man.</p>
<p>The New Testament is clearer concerning the orthodox relationship between God and man. The Gospel of Matthew concerns the mystery of the kingdom; in chapter 1 it says, &ldquo;&lsquo;Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel&rsquo; (which is translated, God with us)&rdquo; (v. 23). The word <em>with</em> in the phrase <em>God with us</em> is not merely objective; it is not a matter of God being among man. Rather, <em>with</em> is subjective; it is a matter of God being within man. In chapter 18 the Lord said, &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst&rdquo; (v. 20), and at the end of chapter 28 He said, &ldquo;I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age&rdquo; (v. 20). The Gospel of Matthew speaks three times of God&rsquo;s being with man: at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end. God&rsquo;s being with man is His mingling with man.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John is even clearer concerning God being mingled with man. Chapter 1 says, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (v. 4). In chapter 6 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world...so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (vv. 51, 57). In chapter 10 He said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life&rdquo; (v. 10). In chapter 15 He said, &ldquo;I am the true vine&rdquo; (v. 1). This verse speaks of the vine, which is linked to the tree of life in Genesis 2:9. The Lord is the vine. We have become branches in the Lord because we have been joined to Him. The Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him...&rdquo; (John 15:5). This indicates that we are abiding in the Lord and that the Lord is abiding in us, just as the branches are in the vine and the vine is in the branches. In other words, the life of the vine becomes the life of the branches, and everything of the vine becomes everything to the branches.</p>
<p>In the Epistles the apostle Paul speaks of &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo; (Col. 3:4), and he says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). The Epistles contain many such expressions. At the end of Revelation the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, and the tree of life grows on both sides of the river (22:1-2). Thus, the thought of the tree of life runs throughout the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL<br />
SIGNIFYING SATAN JOINED TO MAN</h2>
<p>We cannot deny that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan joining himself to man. The tree of life signifies God being mingled with man, but the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan joining himself to man. The tree of life is God mingled with man, and it issues in life. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is Satan joined to man, and it issues in death. The tree of life is of life and gives man life. Likewise, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is of the knowledge of good and evil, and it gives man good and evil, which issue in death. The result of evil is death, and the result of good is also death. As long as either good or evil has a place in man, Satan has a place in man. The issue of this is death.</p>
<p>The line of the tree of life runs from the beginning to the end of the Bible. The line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil also runs from Genesis 2 to Revelation 20. This line includes both good and evil. When I began reading the Bible, I thought that Cain&rsquo;s killing of Abel was evil (Gen. 4:8); that is, it was of Satan. Afterward, I read that a descendant of Cain, Lamech, took multiple wives and was arrogant (vv. 19, 23-24). I thought that was also evil, of Satan. However, I did not have the concept that good is also of Satan. Later, the Lord showed us that our relationship with Him is based on life and that our relationship with Satan is based on good and evil. Every time we contact God, He operates in us, and the result is life, not good or evil. In contrast, when Satan operates in us, the result is good or evil. We usually regard only evil as being of Satan, but we do not regard good as being of Satan. We need to see that just as evil behavior is not life, so also good behavior is not life. Any behavior that is not life is of Satan. Anything we do without contacting God or without taking Him as our food is of Satan. Even preaching the gospel without contacting God or taking Him as our food is of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that is, of Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY TWO TREES AND TWO PATHS<br />
BEING IN FRONT OF MAN</h2>
<p>In the book of Job God asked Satan, &ldquo;Have you considered My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil&rdquo; (1:8). Was God pleased with Job&rsquo;s fearing Him and turning away from evil? This is a profound question. If God had wanted Job to fear Him and to turn away from evil, Job would not have needed to suffer many blows. This shows that Job&rsquo;s fearing God and turning away from evil were not what God wanted.</p>
<p>The Bible is one book, and Job is a part of this one book. At the beginning of the Bible God put man in front of two trees (Gen. 2:8-9). Man is faced with a choice involving only these two trees; there is no third tree. In other words, there are only two paths before man. One path is of life, and the other path is of the knowledge of good and evil. The path of life leads to the eternal life, but the path of the knowledge of good and evil leads to death. This principle is consistent from Genesis to Revelation. Therefore, Job is not an exception in relation to these two paths. By fearing God and turning away from evil, was Job on the path of life or on the path of the knowledge of good and evil? Undoubtedly, he was on the path of the knowledge of good and evil. There is no third path, because there is no third tree. There are only two trees and two paths. Man either partakes of the fruit of the tree of life and thereby takes the path of life, or he partakes of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and thereby takes the path of the knowledge of good and evil. Job&rsquo;s fearing God and turning away from evil were not his partaking of the fruit of the tree of life, nor were they his taking the path of life. Rather, they were his partaking of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and hence taking the path of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is of Satan. Hence, for Job to eat of the fruit of this tree was for him to receive something of Satan. Why would God boast in what Job had eaten? Why would Satan ask God to deal with something of himself that Job had eaten? Was God pleased with Job&rsquo;s fearing Him and turning away from evil? Some may be confused by these questions. The human concept is that God boasted in and praised Job for fearing Him and turning away from evil. However, this may not necessarily be the case. If we read Job in the light of the vision in Genesis 2, we will realize that Job&rsquo;s fearing God and turning away from evil did not please God, for they were something injected by Satan. We must realize that God will tear down even the best things that Satan injects into man.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S UNIQUE DESIRE BEING<br />
TO BRING MAN INTO LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible contains a record of the evil side of Satan as well as the good side of Satan. In the Old Testament the books of history contain accounts related to the side of evil, and the books of poetry contain accounts related to the side of good. God has been working throughout the ages to tear down the good and the evil in man in order to bring man into life.</p>
<p>The books of history record that Cain killed Abel his brother (Gen. 4:8), that Lamech took multiple wives (v. 19), that the earth was filled with violence in the age of Noah (6:11), that the fornications of Sodom and Gomorrah were filthy to the uttermost (18:20; 19:1-9), and that the generations of the children of Israel were corrupt and committed sins and evil continually. These portions speak of the evil side of the tree of knowledge. The Old Testament books of history portray a clear and vivid picture of the evils of Satan and the extent to which he caused man trouble. These books fully portray the evil side of the tree of knowledge.</p>
<p>According to the books of history, there was a minority who were delivered from the evil of the tree of knowledge and lived by the tree of life. Abel was one of these. He was not a doer of good; he was one who contacted God (Gen. 4:4). Enoch was also such a one. The Bible says that Enoch walked with God (5:22, 24). To walk with God is to contact the tree of life, for God is the tree of life. Noah also walked with God (6:9). Abraham built an altar and called upon the name of Jehovah (12:7-8). These ones contacted God. Isaac also built an altar and called on the name of Jehovah (26:25), and Jacob did the same. Jacob was not a good person, but Jacob contacted God, the tree of life (28:18-22). The children of Israel, Jacob&rsquo;s descendants, were as evil as the worldly people, but God gave them to eat the Passover lamb, unleavened bread (Exo. 12), and manna out of heaven (16:14-15, 31-32, 35), which are on the line of the tree of life.</p>
<p>In the books of history the majority of people took the evil path of the tree of knowledge, but a minority took another way. These ones contacted God, touched God, walked with God, and called upon God&rsquo;s name. These ones were on the path of the tree of life. The path of the tree of knowledge and the path of the tree of life are the two paths in the books of history.</p>
<p>After the books of history are the books of poetry. The books of poetry speak of the good aspect of the tree of knowledge. Job feared God and turned away from evil, but he was in the good aspect of the tree of knowledge. Most of the psalmists were also in this good aspect; they had the concept of keeping God&rsquo;s law. This desire to keep the law shows that Satan perverted the intention of the law that God gave on Mount Sinai. This is a profound matter.</p>
<p>From the time the children of Israel ate the Passover lamb in Egypt to when they defeated the Amalekites in the wilderness, built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi (Exo. 17:15), God did everything. God gave them lambs, unleavened bread, manna, and living water out of the cleft rock (12:8; 16:14-15, 31-32; 17:6). When they encountered bitter waters, God made the waters sweet; they experienced Jehovah-rapha, which means &ldquo;Jehovah your Healer&rdquo; (15:22-26). When they had enemies, they experienced Jehovah-nissi, which means &ldquo;Jehovah fought for me.&rdquo; These experiences belong to the tree of life; they are not a matter of conduct. God did not tell the children of Israel what to do or what not to do; He did not tell them how to conduct themselves. Everything He gave to the children of Israel was for their enjoyment. The flesh of the lamb was for them to eat, unleavened bread was for them to eat, manna was for them to eat, and living water was for them to drink. When they were sick, He healed them. When they had enemies, He fought for them. These are the experiences in Exodus 12 through 17, and they are of the tree of life.</p>
<p>One day the children of Israel were influenced by Satan to lean toward the good side of the tree of knowledge. When they said to Moses, &ldquo;All that Jehovah has spoken we will do&rdquo; (19:8), the law was given to expose their inability to do good (ch. 20). Therefore, trying to keep the law is not of life but of good and evil; it belongs to the tree of knowledge. The holy people who wrote the psalms had the law as their background, and they were focused on the good side of the tree of knowledge. They thought that God would be pleased with their doing good and fearing Him (Psa. 1:1-2, 6; 119:1-3). They did not know that their doing good belonged to the tree of knowledge, which God does not want.</p>
<p>In both Job and the Psalms God comes in to tear down again and again. He wants to tear down man&rsquo;s good conduct. Job is a classic example. The result of God&rsquo;s tearing down is that man touches God, meets God, and enters into God. Job said, &ldquo;I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You; / Therefore I abhor myself&rdquo; (Job 42:5-6). This principle also occurs in Psalms. God&rsquo;s tearing down and breaking are for the holy people who wrote the psalms to come out of good and to contact God directly. The psalmists had the concept of the law, but God wanted them to see Him in Christ as their life, light, power, and everything (27:1; 36:9).</p>
<p>The Old Testament books of history are about two groups of people. One group of people developed on the evil side of the tree of knowledge and were judged by God. The other group of people were led by God and learned to contact God and live by the tree of life. The books of poetry show a group of holy God-fearing people who, because of ignorance, developed on the good side of the tree of knowledge. We dare not say that these people were judged by God, but God broke down and tore down what they developed and achieved on the good side of the tree of knowledge. This forced them to contact Him, that is, to contact the tree of life.</p>
<p>Hence, God was not boasting in Job, nor was He praising Job. God seemed to tell Satan that He would even tear down a person who developed on the good side of the tree of knowledge and that He would use Satan to do it. This is a profound matter. Eventually, God forced the God-fearing Job to turn away from good and evil and to touch the tree of life, that is, to touch God Himself.</p>
<p>The books of history are mainly a record of the evil side of the tree of knowledge, and the books of poetry are mainly a record of the good side of the tree of knowledge. However, both sides speak of the development of the tree of knowledge. God judges the evil side, and He tears down the good side. God wants neither evil nor good. God wants life. Life is God to be contacted and enjoyed by man.</p><h2 class="head1">DISCERNING THE DIFFERENCE<br />
BETWEEN GOOD AND LIFE</h2>
<p>Even after two thousand years of history, Christianity is still not free from its involvement with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Although there are wicked men in the world who commit evil deeds and frequently provoke God&rsquo;s judgment, just as the men who developed on the evil side of the tree of knowledge in the Old Testament books of history did, there are a few people chosen by God who are like Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. These ones learn to follow God, contact God, walk with God, and call upon God. They are not on the evil side of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but are on the line of the tree of life. Regrettably, Christianity also has many who are on the side of good, like the men in the books of poetry. A considerable number of believers are developing on the good side of the tree of knowledge. No matter how these people develop, they always encounter God&rsquo;s tearing down. This tearing down is not because they are bad but because they are good. God continues to judge the evil side, and He continues to tear down the good side. The evil side is large and includes all evil men. The good side is narrow and includes only those who fear God and who want to do something for God in order to please Him.</p>
<p>A considerable number of Christians are still in the good of the tree of knowledge, just like the God-fearing men in the books of poetry. A few Christians have been enlightened or torn down to come out of the side of good and are learning to contact God as life. Hence, there are two types of messages, two types of sermons, among Christians. One type of message teaches man how to fear God, how to do something to please God, and how to turn away from evil. This type of message enlightens man in relation to the good side of the tree of knowledge. The other type of message is on the line of the tree of life and leads people to know life. We must ask ourselves whether we are developing and being established according to the good of the tree of knowledge or learning to enjoy the tree of life. Do the messages we give just enlighten believers concerning the good side of the tree of knowledge, or do they bring believers to contact the tree of life? This is a serious matter!</p>
<p>In theory it may seem easy to discern between the two types of messages. However, it is difficult to discern between them because the differences are subtle. For example, we dare not say that it is not good for the saints in a church to zealously offer up their material possessions, but this may not be the tree of life. We dare not say that it is not good for the saints in a locality to keep morning watch and be godly, but this may not be the tree of life. We dare not say that it is not good for a brother to zealously preach the gospel, but this too may not be the tree of life. The distinction is very subtle. Those who serve God should be able to discern between these two trees. No matter how good a thing may be, if it does not touch God, contact God, or lead us to enjoy God or take Him as life, it belongs to the tree of knowledge.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE TREE OF LIFE<br />
BEING THE NEW JERUSALEM,<br />
AND THE ISSUE OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE<br />
BEING BABYLON THE GREAT</h2>
<p>The tree of life signifies the union of God and man, and it issues in the New Jerusalem. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies the mixture of Satan and man, and it issues in Babylon the Great. The Bible begins with two trees and ends with two cities: Babylon the Great and the New Jerusalem. Babylon the Great is the mystery of Satan (Rev. 17:5). The New Jerusalem is the mystery of God. Babylon the Great is the mystery of Satan mixed with man; that is, Satan is one with Babylon the Great even though he cannot be seen. The union of God and man is also a mystery. Man cannot see God, but God can mingle with man. This mystery issues in the New Jerusalem. Throughout the ages Satan has been building Babylon the Great in order to destroy the New Jerusalem. However, God has been destroying Babylon the Great and building up the New Jerusalem. In the end God will triumph; Babylon the Great will fall (14:8; 18:2), and Satan&rsquo;s hideout will be completely torn down. With no place to hide, Satan will be bound by God (20:1-3). After Babylon the Great is destroyed, the New Jerusalem will appear (21:2). The New Jerusalem is the city of God, His dwelling place. The New Jerusalem is the issue of the tree of life. A river of water of life flows in the city, and on both sides of the river of water of life grows the tree of life (22:1-2). Therefore, the New Jerusalem is a mystery with the tree of life as its content, and Babylon the Great is the issue of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>Human society is a part of Babylon the Great, because it is full of the development of good as well as the development of evil. Religion, including Christianity, has always been involved with the development of good. Christianity helps Babylon develop the good side of the tree of knowledge. Inadvertently, even Christians who love and fear the Lord help the development of the good side of the tree of knowledge. Society talks about loving people, religionists talk about loving people, and those who love and fear the Lord also talk about loving people. However, this is not of the tree of life; it is the good side of the tree of knowledge.</p>
<p>We talk about loving people, but if our love is of man, not of God, it is still of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and belongs to the mystery of Satan. We need to be saved to the point of contacting God, enjoying Him, and taking Him as our life. When we take God as our life, His love will be lived out from us. This love is completely different from our human love. Human love is the development of good, but God&rsquo;s love is the issue of life. Human love belongs to Babylon, but God&rsquo;s love belongs to the New Jerusalem. Human love is the development of the mystery of Satan, but God&rsquo;s love is the development of the mystery of God.</p>
<p>We need to be enlightened to see that God and Satan are two trees, two paths, and two issues. The two trees are two sources: one tree is the source of life, and the other tree is the source of good and evil. One path is of life, and the other path is of good and evil. One issue is the mystery of life, the New Jerusalem, and the other issue is the mystery of good and evil, Babylon the Great.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, those who surrounded Him continually asked what they should do (John 6:28; Mark 10:17; cf. Matt. 19:16). Such questions only develop the good side of the tree of knowledge. When Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, came to consult the Lord Jesus, He said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (John 3:3). This is the Lord turning people from the good side of the tree of knowledge to the tree of life. The Lord came to the earth to save man from the tree of knowledge, particularly from its good side, to the tree of life.</p>
<p>The New Testament, especially the Epistles, stresses the tree of life (Rom. 5:10; 1 Cor. 15:45; Gal. 2:20; Col. 3:4). When it does speak concerning matters related to conduct, they are presented as the fruit of the divine life in man (Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16). However, many who read the Bible do not see these matters in relation to the fruit of the tree of life in man; instead, they receive these portions as commandments that they should fulfill. Many cannot discern between the things of the New Jerusalem and the things of Babylon the Great; hence, they confuse good things related to the tree of knowledge with the things of life. We must be enlightened to see the source. If our love comes from God, it is of God and belongs to the New Jerusalem. But if our love is not out of God, it is the good side of the tree of knowledge and belongs to Babylon the Great.</p>
<p>At the end of the Bible there are two cities. Both cities are symbolized by a woman. The New Jerusalem is a woman, and Babylon the Great is also a woman. The New Jerusalem as a woman is called the bride (Rev. 21:2). This means that she is very chaste. Babylon the Great is called a harlot (17:1-5). This means that she is very impure and full of confusion, having both the good and the bad and mixing the good with the evil. In our gatherings may we be a chaste bride who has only the things of the tree of life. We must never be a fornicating harlot who mixes good and evil. Our gatherings should always be the New Jerusalem, not Babylon the Great. We should have only life flowing within; we must not be in the development of the tree of knowledge. May the Lord grace us to see this vision.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TWO TREES BEING TWO LINES<br />
THAT RUN THROUGHOUT THE BIBLE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSISTENT THOUGHT IN THE BIBLE<br />
BEING GOD AS MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the vision in Genesis 2. Even though the Bible contains sixty-six books, it is consistent from the beginning to the end. Most people do not have this thought when they read the Bible, nor can they accurately identify the line of thought that runs throughout the Bible. Some theologians say that the Bible speaks of Christ; therefore, Christ is the subject that holds the Bible together. It is correct to say this, and we often say this.</p>
<p>However, the first two chapters and the last two chapters of the Bible are focused on life. In the beginning of the Bible, after God created man, He placed man before the tree of life for man to notice, contact, and receive the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9). At the end of the Bible the tree of life is growing among the people gained by God throughout the generations (Rev. 22:2). No one can deny that the most crucial portion of the Bible concerns Christ&rsquo;s appearing. This is the incarnation of God to live on the earth (John 1:14, 18). What is the purpose of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming to the earth? He said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life&rdquo; (10:10). The Holy Spirit also testified on His behalf, saying, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (1:4). In a more personal way the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever&rdquo; (6:51). Then the Holy Spirit points out that &ldquo;these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name&rdquo; (20:31). Later, when the apostles went out to preach the gospel, an angel confirmed that they were speaking &ldquo;the words of this life&rdquo; (Acts 5:20). When writing the Epistles, Paul said, &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo; (Col. 3:4); Peter said, &ldquo;His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:3); John said, &ldquo;We...report to you the eternal life&rdquo; (1 John 1:2), and &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life&rdquo; (5:12). These verses show that God&rsquo;s desire to be man&rsquo;s life is a consistent thought in the Bible. In other words, God desires to be mingled with man to become man&rsquo;s content and to be expressed through man. This thought is consistent in the Bible.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:26 says that God created man in His image and according to His likeness. Suppose a brother wants a jacket made for him. The jacket must be made according to his measurements, because it is for him to wear. Likewise, God created man in His image and according to His likeness because man is a vessel that He wants to &ldquo;put on.&rdquo; God wants to put man on for His expression. Therefore, the Bible begins with God&rsquo;s desire to be contained in man so that He would be expressed by man. At the end of Revelation the redeemed people have the tree of life as their content, and God&rsquo;s glory and light are their expression (22:2; 21:23). God&rsquo;s glory and light are God expressed. Chapter 4 says that the God who is sitting on the throne has the appearance of jasper (v. 3). Then chapter 21 says that the wall of the New Jerusalem is jasper (v. 18). This means that in the future all God&rsquo;s redeemed people will express the image of God outwardly, and their content will be God as their life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD COMING IN THE FORM OF FOOD<br />
TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>To a great extent, the Bible was written according to man&rsquo;s ability to comprehend. In order to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life, God must be digested by man and mingled with man. God also wants to be man&rsquo;s strength and supply. The best way to express this desire is to say that God wants to be man&rsquo;s food. There is no other example that can appropriately convey God&rsquo;s desire to enter into man and be digested by man in order to become man&rsquo;s element, life supply, and strength by which man can live. Therefore, from its beginning to its end, the Bible consistently shows that God came as food so that He may enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life. In other words, He wants to be assimilated by man in order to become man&rsquo;s element, supply, and nutrition so that man may live because of Him.</p>
<p>Objectively, the Bible bears the testimony of Christ (John 5:39); subjectively, however, the Bible was written to show us how God in Christ becomes our life (1 John 5:12; Col. 3:4). God wants to be our life, so He came as food for us to eat and digest so that He can become our element and our nutrition. This is how He supplies us to live because of Him (John 6:51, 57). God also wants to live out from within us, that is, to be expressed through us (Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:20-21). This divine thought runs from the beginning to the end of the Bible. If we want a thorough understanding in our reading of the Bible, we must grasp this point; otherwise, our reading of the Bible will not be thorough.</p><h2 class="head1">SATAN INJECTING HIMSELF INTO MAN</h2>
<p>God has an enemy in this universe. This enemy, Satan, wants to counterfeit whatever God desires to do. God wants to enter into man, so His enemy wants to inject himself into man. God wants to be united with man, so His enemy wants to enter into a union with man. Furthermore, before God accomplished His desire, Satan acted first in order to beat God.</p>
<p>For example, the thought of building a city is of God. In Genesis 2 there was only a garden; there was no city. The garden of Eden did not have a wall or a border (vv. 8-14). At the end of the Bible, however, a city appears, and this city has a border (Rev. 21:10-17). Therefore, the desire to build a city began with God. However, who built the first city? In Genesis 4 Cain built the city of Enoch (v. 17). This was done by Satan to frustrate God. Satan was quick to build a city among men because he knew that God wanted to build a city among His people. This is proof that when God desires to do something, Satan will be quick with a counterfeit to frustrate God.</p>
<p>God wants to enter into man, so Satan also wants to enter into man. God wants to be mingled with man, so Satan also wants to inject himself into man. God is aware of Satan&rsquo;s desire, so He placed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden to serve as a reminder and a warning. This tree signifies Satan, who wants to enter into man and become the evil element within man. The issue of man&rsquo;s eating of this tree is that man received death (2:16-17).</p>
<p>In chapter 3 Satan, embodied in the serpent, came in (vv. 1-15). The serpent in chapter 3 and the tree of knowledge in chapter 2 are inseparable; the two are one. When man ate of the tree of knowledge, he received the serpent. It is no wonder that in the New Testament both John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus rebuked the Pharisees, who were followers of Satan, saying that they were the &ldquo;offspring of vipers&rdquo; and a &ldquo;brood of vipers&rdquo; (Matt. 3:7; 12:34; 23:33). Man had received Satan into him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE<br />
BEING THE TWO LINES IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The tree of life signifies God being mingled with man, and the tree of knowledge signifies Satan injecting himself into man. These two trees are two main lines that run through the entire Bible. They are also the controlling thought of the Bible. If we read the Bible without seeing these two lines, we are inexperienced Bible readers.</p>
<p>Before reading a book on military science, we must first grasp the concept of that subject. Then, whether the book touches economics, politics, history, or geography, we will not deviate from the central thought. We should apply this principle when we read the Bible. It is very difficult to understand the controlling thought of the Bible. Therefore, in order for the saints to understand this thought, I have done my best to present the line that connects the Bible. This line is in the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation. If we read these four chapters and compare the beginning and the end of the Bible, we will understand the controlling line in these chapters. Then it will be relatively easy for us to read the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LINES OF THE TREE OF LIFE AND<br />
OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The tree of life and the tree of knowledge are the controlling lines in the Bible. We may say that the Bible consists of the two lines of God being mingled with man and of Satan injecting himself into man. We will now consider the Old Testament based on these two lines. The Old Testament can be divided into three sections. The first section is the books of history, the second section is the books of poetry, and the third section is the books of the prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Books of History</h2>
<p>In the books of history the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s style of writing shows how people developed according to the evil aspect of the tree of knowledge. It also shows how God called a group of people out of this evil development to contact and enjoy the tree of life. However, the majority of mankind, including the Israelites, developed according to the evil aspect of the tree of knowledge.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Books of Poetry</h2>
<p>The books of poetry present a group of saints who remained in the development of the good aspect of the tree of knowledge, even though God had separated them from worldly people. Because they remained in the tree of knowledge, they were smitten by God. God smote them so that they would be freed from the good aspect of the tree of knowledge and would live purely in God who is life. Therefore, in Song of Songs, the last of the books of poetry, man is God&rsquo;s beloved, and God is man&rsquo;s Beloved and Husband (1:9, 14; 2:2, 10). Apart from God, man cannot have joy. Everything related to man depends on God, and man needs to enter into complete union with God. In Song of Songs man is freed from both the evil and the good aspects of the tree of knowledge in order to fully enjoy the tree of life, God Himself. God is the tree of life to be man&rsquo;s Beloved, and man is God&rsquo;s beloved. In this realm there is neither evil nor good; there is only God as the Beloved. The Beloved is everything to His loved one. She does not know what it means to do good, nor does she care for doing evil. She simply loves and pursues the Beloved.</p><h2 class="head2">The Books of the Prophets</h2>
<p>The last section of the Old Testament is the books of the prophets. The prophets were God&rsquo;s spokesmen. In other words, the prophets were people who expressed God. The Spirit of Jehovah fell upon every prophet (Ezek. 11:5). This means that every prophet was joined to God. The prophets did not have the concept of good and evil. The prophets&rsquo; thought of God was related to Jehovah God coming upon them.</p>
<p>The books of history mainly speak of the evil aspect of the tree of knowledge. However, in the books of history God brought out a group of people who enjoyed Him as the tree of life. The books of poetry present the good aspect of the tree of knowledge, but in these books God compelled a group of people to enjoy Him as their life, signified by the tree of life. The books of the prophets are neither concerning the evil aspect nor the good aspect of the tree of knowledge. The books of the prophets present a few people who enjoyed the tree of life and thus became God&rsquo;s spokesmen. The prophets were filled with God. They lived neither by the evil aspect nor by the good aspect of the tree of knowledge. They were delivered out of the tree of knowledge to live by the tree of life. They were mingled with God and filled with God. As a result, their speaking was God&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>For example, Hebrews 2 quotes Isaiah and says, &ldquo;Behold, I and the children whom God has given to Me&rdquo; (v. 13). This word was spoken by the prophet Isaiah (Isa. 8:18), but in Hebrews it is presented as a word spoken by Christ Himself. This indicates that Isaiah&rsquo;s speaking was Christ&rsquo;s speaking. Another example is the word spoken by the prophet David in his suffering, which was also spoken by Christ in His suffering: &ldquo;My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?&rdquo; (Psa. 22:1; Matt. 27:46). When David spoke this, he was not a king but a prophet. All the prophets were filled with God. We can also touch God in the book of Daniel. When we read this book, we can sense that he was a man in God who was filled with God. Daniel was a man who breathed in God. Therefore, the prophets were people who left the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in order to be in the enjoyment of the tree of life.</p>
<p>The most important thought of God that was expressed through the prophets is that God is the Husband of His people and that His people are His wife (Isa. 54:5-6). God cried out to His people repeatedly, &ldquo;Return unto Me&rdquo; (44:22; cf. 55:7; Jer. 3:1; Joel 2:12). When we read these verses, we think that God wants His people to depart from evil things and to return to Him in order to do good things. Such a concept is of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. However, this is not God&rsquo;s thought. God&rsquo;s desire is for His people to leave everything that is not God and return to God. The prophet Isaiah says, &ldquo;Your Maker is your Husband; / Jehovah of hosts is His name... / For Jehovah has called you, / Like a wife who has been forsaken and is grieved in spirit, / Even like the wife of one&rsquo;s youth when she has been rejected, / Says your God&rdquo; (Isa. 54:5-6). Jehovah said through Jeremiah, &ldquo;My covenant which they broke, although I was their Husband&rdquo; (Jer. 31:32). Jehovah also declared, &ldquo;It is said, / If a man divorces his wife / And she goes from him / And becomes another man&rsquo;s wife, / Will he return to her again? / Will not that land be / Utterly polluted? / But you have committed fornication with many lovers. / Yet return to Me&rdquo; (3:1). In the book of Ezekiel the most heartbreaking thing to God was that the people of Israel had other lovers besides Him (ch. 16). This means that man does not enjoy God. Similar words are found in the book of Hosea: &ldquo;In that day, declares Jehovah, / You will call Me My Husband / And will no longer call Me Baali&rdquo; (2:16). This thought is in all the books of the prophets: God is standing in the position of a husband and calling His wife, who has forsaken Him, to return. The prophets are not saying that the husband-forsaking wife must do good in order to be right. It is not a matter of good or evil but of the wife enjoying and being joined to her husband. The prophets were a group of people who were filled with God, enjoyed God, and lived in God. Their ministry and their commission were to call those who did not enjoy God and had forsaken God to return in order to be joined to God and enjoy God again.</p>
<p>When the prophets called God&rsquo;s people to return to Him, they spoke considerably concerning God coming to be man&rsquo;s Savior (Isa. 19:20; 43:3; Jer. 14:8; Hosea 13:4). The calls to the God-forsaking people to return to their God in order to be joined to Him and enjoy Him were prophecies that expressed the need of God&rsquo;s people to enjoy Him as their Husband. These prophecies were also concerning His coming one day to become man&rsquo;s Savior, that is, to be born of a virgin and be given the name Immanuel, which means &ldquo;God with man&rdquo; (Isa. 7:14). The prophets spoke of Christ&rsquo;s birth, which was God&rsquo;s coming. God came to be the Bridegroom and be joined to man. This was also spoken by John the Baptist, the last prophet. He said, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom&rdquo; (John 3:29). This indicates that God became flesh to be the Bridegroom. John introduced Christ as the Lamb and as the Bridegroom (1:29; 3:29). Christ came not only to be the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world but also to be the Bridegroom who marries the bride. Hence, John testified that Christ is the Bridegroom, the Husband, spoken of in the Old Testament. He came to marry His redeemed people so that they would be joined to Him.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus began His ministry, He too said that He was the Bridegroom. He said to the Pharisees, &ldquo;The sons of the bridechamber cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them, can they? For as long a time as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast. But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast in that day&rdquo; (Mark 2:19-20). The consistent thought in these verses shows that God is the tree of life in order to be joined to us so that we would be completely freed from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>The thought of God freeing man from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is clearer in the Epistles. Romans 7 speaks clearly and thoroughly concerning the good and the evil of the tree of knowledge; both the good and the evil are apart from God. Chapter 8 says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death&rdquo; (v. 2). The law of sin and of death is the law of the tree of knowledge. When the tree of life comes, it delivers man from the tree of knowledge. A believer is someone who has been delivered from the tree of knowledge in order to live by the tree of life.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ&rdquo; (11:2). Here again is the thought of Christ being our Husband. In Ephesians he says that Christ wants to be joined to man, that the people who are joined to Christ are His counterpart, and that Christ is their Husband (5:25, 31-32). Finally, at the end of Revelation the holy city, New Jerusalem, comes down out of heaven. This city is a wife, a bride, whom Christ will marry (19:7; 21:2). Furthermore, the tree of life will be enjoyed in this city (22:2).</p>
<p>The line of the tree of life is in the Bible. The Old Testament is divided into three major sections. One section is on the evil aspect of the tree of knowledge, another section is on the good aspect of the tree of knowledge, and the last section is concerning a group of prophets who were delivered from good as well as from evil to live exclusively by the tree of life. They were joined to God, lived in God, and were filled with God. Hence, they became God&rsquo;s spokesmen, expressing God&rsquo;s thoughts, and their ministry was to call the people who had turned away from God to return and to enjoy God and thus be delivered from everything outside of God.</p><h2 class="head2">The Principle of the Ministry of the Prophets<br />
Being to Call People to Enjoy the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>A prophet breathes God, lives in God, and is joined to God. A prophet serves as God&rsquo;s spokesman and God&rsquo;s expression; hence, his words are God&rsquo;s words. A prophet&rsquo;s ministry and his words are to call people to enjoy God. A prophet tells people that God was incarnated to be a man, Immanuel, in order to bring man into the experience of enjoying God in Christ as man&rsquo;s food and man&rsquo;s life. In other words, a person who ministers as a prophet enjoys the tree of life so that he can call others and lead others to also enjoy the tree of life. May we be enlightened to see and grasp this principle. Then we will see that all the Epistles in the New Testament were written according to this principle. The writers of the New Testament Epistles were prophets; they were joined to God, filled with God, and lived in God. They breathed God, so they became His expression and His spokesmen; their words were God&rsquo;s words. The message, the ministry, of every Epistle is to lead people into enjoying God in Christ as their life.</p>
<p>If a brother who functions as God&rsquo;s mouthpiece is enlightened to see that a prophet enjoys the tree of life so that he may call others to enjoy the tree of life, he will lose his taste for other types of messages. His desire will be to speak only of Immanuel, that is, God coming in the form of food to be man&rsquo;s life. God wants to be mingled with man to become man&rsquo;s element and to be everything to man. This does not mean that we do not understand other topics but that they have become tasteless. The tree of life has become our yardstick for measuring every message. Any message that is apart from God coming to be man&rsquo;s life, Immanuel, is a wind of teaching spoken of in Ephesians 4:14. Messages that are not winds of teaching are spoken by persons who enjoy God as life, who are His expression, and who lead others to live in Christ and to enjoy Him as their life. Only such messages are called messages of life. They are spoken by persons who minister as prophets. Only such messages can give people the supply of life.</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves whether our messages are winds of teaching or messages of life. This is a serious question. Our messages may be according to the Bible, but if they cannot lead others to enjoy life, they are winds of teaching. Persons who genuinely minister as prophets, that is, who enjoy the tree of life, live in God, and allow God to fill them, will become an expression of God and will speak for God. They will bring others to enjoy God as their life because they give messages of life. All other messages are winds of teaching and are accursed.</p>
<p>Ninety-nine percent of the messages given in Christianity are concerning doing things. They are winds of teaching that lead people to contact the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The things that God tore down in the Old Testament saints are being built up in Christianity, because there is a lack of light concerning the principle of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>A person who desires to genuinely minister as a prophet must be delivered from the tree of knowledge and live in the tree of life. The book of Isaiah is not concerning fearing God, because Isaiah was a person who breathed God (12:4). The book of Hosea is not concerning morality, because Hosea was a man living in God (chs. 1&mdash;3). The book of Ezekiel is not concerning the law, because Ezekiel was a person living in God. He saw that men were like a pile of dry bones and that only by God breathing His breath into them can they be made alive (37:2, 5-10). The books of the prophets reveal that the prophets were delivered from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and lived in God, in the tree of life.</p>
<p>What the prophets enjoyed was a foretaste. When they were enjoying the tree of life, they prophesied concerning the coming of Christ as the reality of the tree of life. For example, Isaiah says, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel&rdquo; (7:14), and &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace&rdquo; (9:6). On the one hand, the Old Testament prophets enjoyed the anticipated tree of life, and on the other hand, they prophesied that Christ would come as the reality of the tree of life. In principle, we are doing the same today; however, we are not in the prophecy but in the reality. The line of the tree of life is seen in the Old Testament prophets, and it is the principle of the ministry of the New Testament prophets.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY OF ENJOYING GOD<br />
REQUIRING A CHANGE OF CONCEPT</h1>
<p>If we want to take the way of enjoying God, we must have a change of concept. Everything that a person does is according to his concept. A person&rsquo;s concept determines how he does something. Likewise, the way we handle spiritual matters depends on our spiritual seeing. This principle also applies to our enjoyment of God. If we want to enter into the reality of the enjoyment of God, we must see a controlling vision.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I experienced a dynamic salvation when I was young. This was over thirty years ago. Afterward, the Lord&rsquo;s grace to me was so rich that I was willing to pursue Him at any cost. For this reason I spent much time praying and reading the Bible. I spent more time to read the Bible than to do anything else. I was devoted to studying the Bible. However, even though I exerted much effort to read the Bible and pray, I did not receive much benefit.</p>
<p>It was not until I was forty years of age that the Lord revealed to me the way of enjoying Him. I was disappointed that for twenty years most of my time and energy had been wasted. Most of my prayers were of no value, and the time that I had spent reading the Bible and other spiritual books was also of no value. This is when I realized that our way of working was wrong and that our way of spiritual pursuit was also wrong.</p>
<p>Because I suffered a great loss from taking the wrong way, I do not want others to repeat the same mistake. I hope that others can take the way of enjoying God. I implore the saints to no longer take the wrong way. We should consider our former way of pursuit. We must have a drastic change of concept. We need to have a controlling vision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOD WHOM CHRISTIANS WORSHIP<br />
DIFFERING FROM THE GOD WHOM MUSLIMS WORSHIP</h2>
<p>The relationship between man and God that is presented in the Bible is different from the worship rendered to God in Islam. The sincerity of Muslims can put Christians to shame, because Muslims are more pious than most Christians when they worship God. However, the worship of Muslims is derived from a natural concept. They worship God, but they do not know what it means to enjoy God. They worship a God who is outside of them; they do not understand that God can enter into them and have a life relationship with them.</p>
<p>It is a pity that many Christians do not know that we worship a God who has entered into us and has a life relationship with us. Some may understand this as a doctrine, but in their experience many Christians worship a God who is outside of them. They have the sentiment that their worship, prayer, and service are toward a God who is outside of them.</p>
<p>There are verses in the Bible that tell us to worship the God who is in heaven and to come into His presence and make our requests known to Him (Exo. 20:1-5; Phil. 4:6). However, the Bible also says, &ldquo;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit&rdquo; (1 John 4:13), and &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing&rdquo; (John 15:5). These verses speak of God&rsquo;s desire to enter into man and have a life relationship with man. The Bible contains many such portions.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that worshipping God is a matter of abiding in Him. Unless we worship God by abiding in Him, our worship is of no value in God&rsquo;s eyes, because He has said, &ldquo;Apart from Me you can do nothing.&rdquo; The phrase <em>apart from Me</em> may also be rendered as &ldquo;outside of Me.&rdquo; Hence, worship to a God who is in heaven is not considered by God as worship. John 15:7 says, &ldquo;If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.&rdquo; This shows that even when we pray to the Lord, we need to abide in Him. Only the prayers that we utter when abiding in the Lord are valuable to Him.</p>
<p>Bible students acknowledge that the word <em>in</em> is used many times in the New Testament. For example, John 15:4 says, &ldquo;Abide <em>in</em> Me and I <em>in</em> you,&rdquo; and 1 John 3:24 says, &ldquo;He who keeps His commandments abides <em>in</em> Him, and He <em>in</em> him.&rdquo; There are many such instances in the New Testament. Regrettably, this thought is not in our natural concept; hence, many people do not notice this word when they read the Bible. When people read the book of Ephesians, they are not impressed with the phrases <em>in Christ</em> and <em>in the Lord.</em> But they are impressed with the verses concerning husbands loving their wives and wives being subject to their husbands (5:22-33), and with the verses concerning children obeying their parents and parents not provoking their children to anger (6:1-4), and with the verses concerning slaves serving their masters faithfully and masters treating their slaves properly (vv. 5-9). Ephesians is a short book with six chapters, but the phrases <em>in Christ</em> (1:3, 10, 12; 4:32), <em>in Christ Jesus</em> (1:1; 2:6, 7, 10, 13; 3:6, 11, 21), <em>in Him</em> and <em>in whom</em> (1:4, 7, 10, 11, 13; 2:21, 22; 3:12; 4:21, 30), and <em>in the Lord</em> (2:21; 4:1, 17; 5:8; 6:1, 10, 21) are used many times. According to the Bible, loving one&rsquo;s wife, being subject to one&rsquo;s husband, honoring one&rsquo;s parents, teaching and caring for one&rsquo;s children, serving one&rsquo;s master faithfully, and treating one&rsquo;s slaves properly need to be done in the Lord (5:20-25; 6:1-9). It is a pity that most people do not have this realization. The problem is that God&rsquo;s children have not had a change in concept. Having a change in concept depends on seeing a vision.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOD WHOM CHRISTIANS WORSHIP<br />
DIFFERING FROM THE GOD IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The God whom Christians worship is different not only from the objects worshipped in Gentile religions but also from the God who was worshipped in the Old Testament. People in the Old Testament worshipped the true and living God, but in the New Testament we worship the God of resurrection. The main difference between the living God and the God of resurrection is that the living God is outside of man, whereas the God of resurrection is within man and is mingled with man. When the Israelites were in the wilderness, they followed God, who did things for them outwardly. He was the living God. The New Testament, however, presents not merely the living God but the God of resurrection, because in the New Testament God dwells in man and is mingled with man. The New Testament does not present a God who is outside of man or who merely accomplishes miracles by His great power to manifest Himself as the true and living God. Rather, in the New Testament we see the God who is joined and mingled with man as one and who manifests Himself as the God of resurrection. He is God, yet He is a man. This is the God of resurrection. The living God does not have the human element, but the God of resurrection has the human element. We worship the God of resurrection, and God wants us to bear the testimony of the God of resurrection.</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves whether our worship of God is an outward matter or an inward matter. In order for our worship to be an inward matter, we need the Lord to change our concept. Our spiritual pursuit, prayer, and enjoyment of God do not depend on how much time we set aside nor on our learning to be quiet before God. We need a change in concept. We do not worship a God who is outside of us, nor do we pray in order to ask Him to do many things for us. We need to break out of such concepts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER BEING TO ENJOY GOD,<br />
NOT TO ASK FOR THINGS</h2>
<p>After I received mercy from the Lord, I would sometimes linger before the Lord for a considerable length of time without praying for things. If you were to ask me what I would do during such a long period of time or how I would pray, I can testify that my prayers did not have a subject. I did not take the work as my subject; instead, God was my subject. I would take Him as the focus and subject of my prayers. I would behold Him, praise Him, absorb Him, and enjoy Him and thus take Him as my subject.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find an example of the Old Testament saints or of the Lord Jesus and the disciples in the New Testament praying to ask God for so many things, as God&rsquo;s children do today. The Bible reveals that the people who knew God rarely petitioned for things. Rather, they drew near to God, contacted God, and enjoyed God.</p>
<p>If we would read the book of Acts carefully, we will realize that even when the disciples were seeking God&rsquo;s leading, their prayers were not like the prayers of Christians today. There is no record of Philip praying, &ldquo;Lord, how shall I preach the gospel? Do You want me to go to the desert or remain in the city?&rdquo; However, we must believe that Philip was a man of prayer. The subject of Philip&rsquo;s prayer was not the Lord&rsquo;s leading; his prayer was his enjoyment of God. Philip was a person who touched God and lived in God. Hence, when it was necessary, God could lead him to the desert (8:26) or take him away (v. 39). These matters were God&rsquo;s concern, not Philip&rsquo;s. Therefore, prayer is not a matter of persons who are outside of God seeking the leading of a God who is outside of them so that they may know what to do. Rather, prayer is a matter of enjoying the God who indwells us and of being mingled more with Him. A person of prayer is disarmed before God; he follows God according to His leading. Hence, Philip would not have sought God&rsquo;s leading about a particular matter; he would have received God&rsquo;s leading because he enjoyed God.</p>
<p>We must have a change of concept and learn this lesson. We are not dealing with a God who is outside of us, nor should we petition Him for many things. We do not need to tell Him when we are sick or when we have a need, because whether or not we tell Him, He already knows. Rather, we must learn to contact Him, absorb Him, enjoy Him, and linger in His presence. When God comes, the supply for our lack comes, the healing for our sickness comes, and the solution to our problem comes. When God comes, everything we need comes.</p>
<p>Prayer is not focused on things; prayer is for breathing God. Hence, we should forget other things when we go to the Lord. There is no need to pray for many things. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed? For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you&rdquo; (Matt. 6:31-33). Hence, when we go to the Lord, we should do our best to put other matters behind us and forget them, and we should learn only one thing: to absorb God, breathe God, and enjoy God.</p>
<p>Seeking and zealous Christians worship God, serve God, and pray to God. They are much better than Christians who are not seeking, who are cold, and who do not worship God, serve God, or pray to God. When zealous Christians enter into the Lord&rsquo;s presence, they often pray concerning the church, the work, their family, and their career. However, even though they might pray for half an hour, they may not have spent one minute to absorb God. This is our condition; this kind of worship is according to the human concept. If we have a vision, we will realize that this is not the way to worship God. The proper way to worship God is to be in God and to absorb and enjoy Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING TO ENJOY GOD,<br />
NOT TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE</h2>
<p>The same principle applies to our reading the Bible. We read the Bible to contact God and enjoy Him. Reading the Bible is not for us to receive teachings. Many people zealously pursue the Lord, but they cannot escape studying doctrines and teachings when they come to the Word of God. It is easy for people to fall into this snare when they read the Bible.</p>
<p>If we do not use the Bible properly, it will become a snare in our spiritual pursuit. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the scribes and Pharisees did not know Him simply because they were well versed in the Old Testament, which was a snare to them. They understood and highly regarded the Scriptures, but they were not willing to come to the Lord so that they might have life (John 5:39-40). Likewise, many people read the Bible, but they are not willing to come to the Lord and receive Him. They may have a thorough understanding of the Bible, but they do not touch God. Hence, it is one thing to read the Bible and another thing to contact God. It is one thing to receive teachings from the Bible, but it is another thing to absorb God. There is a distinction between receiving teachings and absorbing God.</p>
<p>Let me use my testimony as an example. After I left my job to serve the Lord, I would take only a few clothes whenever I traveled for the work, but I took many books. My luggage was almost filled with books. Some brothers teased me and said that I had a mobile library. When I studied the Bible, there were books in front of my bed, on the desk, and on the chairs. I used at least seven versions of the Bible, various Bible commentaries, and an encyclopedia of the Bible. However, after 1943 I did not take any reference books when I traveled; I took only one book&mdash;the Bible. Some might think that I no longer needed the reference books because I had already read them. The fact is that those reference books could impart only knowledge to me. They did not bring me to God that I might enjoy Him.</p>
<p>I have observed some brothers reading reference books with the intention of bringing traditional Christian theology into our midst. However, to bring in the things of Christianity is to take the old way. There are more books on Bible exposition in Christianity than there are books on other fields of knowledge. When I was young, I read and treasured a book that explained the seventy weeks in the book of Daniel. I spent much time to read the book, memorize it, and speak it to others. Later, I learned that there were many different expositions of the seventy weeks and that there are at least a hundred interpretations of Revelation. A person who reads only one interpretation will be deceived. A senior co-worker once told me that if we do not want to be deceived by books on Bible exposition, we must read them thoroughly. This word was spoken from his experience.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that most of those who have studied the Bible have fallen into the trap of reference books. As a result, they merely studied the letter of the Bible. When George M&#252;ller was raised up, he read the Bible to touch God&rsquo;s presence. However, he was not able to tell people that to read the Bible is to absorb and enjoy God. But in recent years the Lord has given us this revelation: to pray is to breathe God and to read the Bible is to absorb God. Both our prayer and our reading the Bible should be our enjoyment of God.</p>
<p>When Christians hear a word concerning fellowshipping with the Lord, they immediately think that this means to go before the Lord in prayer in order to tell Him everything and to converse with Him. They compare this to conversing with a friend&mdash;two separate persons coming together to talk. This, however, is not what the Bible refers to as fellowship. According to the Bible, the Lord&rsquo;s fellowship with us is not an outward matter. Rather, it is a matter of His being in us and our being in Him; He and we are mingled together. We absorb Him into us and allow the Spirit to bring us into Him. This is fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION FOR MAN</h2>
<p>We will now consider what God desires to gain in man, as revealed in the Bible. We will consider two points in a way that is simple and easy to understand.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Giving Himself to Man for Man to Enjoy</h2>
<p>The Word of God clearly reveals that God&rsquo;s intention is to give Himself to man for man to enjoy and thereby for Him to be everything to man. According to the Bible, God put Himself before the man whom He had created in order for man to eat Him (Gen. 2:9). God did not present Himself as the great and awe-inspiring God who is sitting on the throne in heaven and asking the man whom He created to worship and serve Him. Instead, He presented Himself as the tree of life. Through such a picture God seemed to be saying to Adam, &ldquo;I do not want you to adore Me, nor do I want you to serve Me. I want you to eat Me, to receive Me, so that I may be your enjoyment and become your content and your everything.&rdquo; This is the significance of God presenting Himself as the tree of life to man. We must keep in mind that this is God&rsquo;s desire for man. The human concepts of worshipping and serving God are natural concepts that were brought in after man&rsquo;s fall. These concepts are not what God desires.</p>
<p>To this day people still have the concepts of worshipping God, serving Him, and doing something for Him. They do not have the concept that God wants to be man&rsquo;s enjoyment. God does not want man to serve Him or to worship Him outwardly. He only wants man to give Him a way to enter into him as food. God wants to be what man eats, drinks, breathes, enjoys, and lives by. God wants to be man&rsquo;s life, nature, and everything.</p>
<p>We need our concept to be changed. God has no desire for us to worship Him or to serve Him outwardly. His intention is to enter into us to be our content and our enjoyment. However, most believers have the concept that to remember the Lord is to meditate on the numerous sufferings that He experienced on their behalf, that is, on His life from the throne to the manger, from the manger to the cross, and from the cross back to the throne. The Lord does not want this kind of remembrance. Such remembrance is a human concept and is like the remembrance of one&rsquo;s ancestors. The remembrance that the Lord spoke of is this: &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body...Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26-28). Our eating and drinking the Lord are our remembrance of the Lord. How much we remember the Lord depends on how much we eat and drink Him. The Lord&rsquo;s intention is that we would receive more of His element every time we remember Him. When we remember the Lord according to our natural concept, our gratitude toward Him is what increases. There is a great difference between these two kinds of remembrance.</p>
<p>In the same principle, God has no intention for us to worship or serve Him outwardly. God&rsquo;s intention is to enter into us, men of clay, to cause us to have a change in nature and become men of gold. He has no other intention. For this reason, the tree of life is spoken of at the end of the Bible. In the New Jerusalem God&rsquo;s created and redeemed people have tasted and enjoyed Him, and their nature has been fully changed. Initially, they were men of clay, but now they have been transformed into a city of pure gold that shines forth the light of the glory of God (Rev. 21:10-11, 18). This is God&rsquo;s intention. If we see this, our concept related to God&rsquo;s work will change. In the New Jerusalem there is no worship and service according to the human concept. In the New Jerusalem there will only be God as the tree of life to be the enjoyment of His redeemed people. The God whom we enjoy will flow into us to become our constituent so that He may be expressed through us. Then God&rsquo;s intention will be fulfilled.</p><h2 class="head2">Desiring That Man Only Enjoy Him</h2>
<p>God does not want us to do something for Him. God wants us to enjoy Him. The issue of our enjoying Him is His responsibility, not ours. The branches of a tree bear fruit not by their effort; it is the spontaneous issue of their enjoying the tree&rsquo;s sap. Whether a tree bears peaches, apples, oranges, or pears is not the concern of the branches but the responsibility of the sap within the branches. Likewise, the work we should do, the places we should go, and the actions we should take are not our responsibility. Our need is to enjoy everything that is in God. The spontaneous outcome of God becoming our enjoyment is that we will bear fruit.</p>
<p>Hence, we need a change in our concept. It should not be that we first decide to visit some brothers and then kneel before the Lord to pray for them. Rather, it should be that we go before the Lord to enjoy Him, appropriate Him, and breathe Him. We are not considering the brothers but considering God, nor are we considering the work of visitation, but we are eating, drinking, and enjoying God. After we have enjoyed Him in such a way, He will spontaneously bear fruit in us; He will lead us to visit a certain brother or several brothers. Such visitation is fruit borne by God from within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN LIFE DEPENDING ON<br />
THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD</h2>
<p>To see that God wants us to enjoy Him and that He does not want us to do anything for Him is to see that the Christian life is a matter of enjoyment. Our salvation is for us to enjoy God, and our spiritual growth depends on our enjoyment of God. Even our service and labor depend on our enjoyment of God. God has no intention for us to do something for Him; He only wants us to enjoy Him. Moreover, He is not outside of us. He has entered into us to be our enjoyment as our food and drink.</p>
<p>If we realize that God wants us to enjoy Him and that He does not want us to do anything for Him, we will be able to enjoy, absorb, and appropriate God. If our concept is changed so that we see these two points, it will be easy for us to live a life of enjoying God.</p>
<p>The burden of this chapter is for us to see a vision. God has given Himself to us for us to enjoy so that He may become our content. God does not want us to do something for Him; He wants us only to enjoy Him, absorb Him, and appropriate Him moment by moment. If we will enjoy, absorb, and appropriate Him more, fruit will be manifested through us spontaneously. Our service and worship before the Lord should be the fruit that we bear; our service and worship should not be a work that we do. Our ability to bear fruit depends on our enjoying God, absorbing God, and appropriating God, thus allowing His element to produce fruit within us. Such enjoyment, absorption, and appropriation are what the Bible refers to as fellowship.</p>
<p>Fellowship is not merely communication between man and God; rather, it is the mingling of God and man. Fellowship is our absorbing God, letting Him mingle Himself with us, and letting Him bring us deeper into Himself so that we are mingled with Him. He and we are mingled with one another. This is real fellowship. Fellowship does not depend on our praying for many things, uttering many words, knowing many verses, understanding many teachings, or receiving much instruction. Fellowship depends on how much we breathe God when we pray and how much we absorb God when we read the Bible. It is possible to not understand many portions of the Bible but still absorb God while reading the Bible. This is the true meaning of fellowship between us and God.</p>
<p>We truly need a clear vision and a change of concept. Perhaps after having a change of concept, a brother may no longer &ldquo;know&rdquo; how to pray. Whether we know how to pray is of no consequence; it is not important. What matters is that we realize what God is doing and what God wants so that we know what kind of prayer, Bible reading, and fellowship we should have in order to absorb God and enjoy Him. Without this vision our worship, prayer, and Bible reading will merely be religious activities. May the Lord have mercy on us so that our vision would be clear.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">CRUCIAL POINTS<br />
CONCERNING HOW TO ENJOY GOD</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider twenty crucial points concerning how to enjoy God. These points will give us an accurate understanding of enjoying God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN<br />
NOT DEPENDING ON THINGS</h2>
<p>The first point is that God has no intention that man would do something for Him, nor is His intention related to doing things for man. In other words, God&rsquo;s relationship with man does not depend on doing or receiving things. God&rsquo;s relationship with man is not a matter of things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING FOOD<br />
TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE AND LIFE SUPPLY</h2>
<p>God comes to man as food in order to be man&rsquo;s life and life supply. God wants to be man&rsquo;s food so that He may be man&rsquo;s life. God&rsquo;s purpose is for man to receive Him and to enjoy Him so that He may be mingled with man and become man&rsquo;s content. Thus God becomes man&rsquo;s content and man becomes God&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S LIVING, MOVE, AND WORK<br />
BEING THE ISSUE OF MINGLING WITH GOD</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s living, move, and work should be the issue of the mingling of God and man. Everything related to man should be a matter of two natures. Even prayer and worship should be the issue of man being mingled with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT FINDING OR ENJOYING GOD<br />
APART FROM CHRIST</h2>
<p>Man can neither find nor enjoy God apart from Christ, because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, the Son of God, bodily (Col. 2:9).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNION AND MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN<br />
BEING THROUGH THE INCARNATION, DEATH,<br />
AND RESURRECTION OF THE LORD JESUS</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was incarnated to bring God into man, and He died and was resurrected to bring man into God. Hence, the union of God and man and the mingling of God with man are through the incarnation, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S DEATH ON THE CROSS<br />
DEALING WITH THE RECORD OF SIN,<br />
SIN, THE FLESH, THE OLD CREATION, SATAN,<br />
THE WORLD, AND DEATH</h2>
<p>The death of the Lord Jesus on the cross erased the record of man&rsquo;s sin before God, dealt with sin in man, and solved the problems of the flesh, the old creation, Satan, the world, and death. Since every negative thing has been dealt with through the death of the Lord Jesus on the cross, we are delivered from every negative thing when we are joined to His death and live in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD RESURRECTING FROM THE DEAD<br />
TO BECOME THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>After resurrecting from the dead, the Lord Jesus became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) and entered into heaven (Heb. 9:24). Hence, everything that God is and everything that the Lord Jesus has experienced are in the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE SEVEN SPIRITS<br />
SENT FORTH INTO ALL THE EARTH</h2>
<p>The Spirit possesses all that God is and has done, and now the Spirit is the seven Spirits sent forth into all the earth (Rev. 5:6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">TOUCHING THE SPIRIT BEING TO TOUCH<br />
THE LORD CHRIST AND ALSO TO TOUCH GOD</h2>
<p>Any person who seeks God in spirit and truthfulness (John 4:24) will touch the Spirit. When a person touches the Spirit, he touches the Lord Christ and also God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT REACHING MAN INITIALLY<br />
AS THE JUDGING SPIRIT, THE CONVICTING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Spirit initially reaches man as the judging Spirit, the convicting Spirit. Hence, when man touches the Spirit, he sees that he is condemned in God&rsquo;s light and therefore is convicted (16:8).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONVICTING SPIRIT CAUSING MAN<br />
TO BREATHE OUT SINS AND SELF<br />
AND TO BREATHE IN THE ELEMENTS IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When man is convicted by the Spirit, he breathes out his sins and the self. At the same time he spontaneously breathes in the elements in the Spirit. Thus man is filled with the Spirit, with the Lord Jesus, and with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BREATHING IN THE SPIRIT BEING<br />
TO EAT, DRINK, AND ENJOY GOD</h2>
<p>To breathe in the Spirit is to eat, drink, and enjoy God. The God whom we breathe becomes everything that we need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE BEING TO BE JOINED WITH MAN,<br />
MINGLED WITH MAN, AND ONE WITH MAN</h2>
<p>When we breathe in God, He not only becomes everything that we need; He also operates within us to carry out His will (Phil. 2:13). God desires to operate in man by being joined with man, mingled with man, and one with man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER BEING TO BREATHE OUT<br />
THE HUMAN ELEMENT AND TO BREATHE IN GOD</h2>
<p>Prayer is a matter of breathing. Prayer is not mainly asking God to do things. Rather, prayer is to breathe out the human element and to breathe in God. This is genuine prayer.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE BEING A RECORD OF GOD<br />
BEING FOOD TO MAN<br />
IN ORDER TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible is the expression of God. God came as food in order to be man&rsquo;s life; hence, the Bible is a record of God being food to man so that He can be man&rsquo;s life. Therefore, we should not read the Bible in order to receive teachings or merely to understand the truth. We should read the Bible to obtain food and thereby obtain the supply of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE BIBLE WITH OUR SPIRIT<br />
TO RECEIVE ITS WORDS AS SPIRIT AND LIFE<br />
INTO OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Even though the Bible consists of words, the Spirit is life in the Bible. If we do not read the Bible in the Spirit, the Bible will be dead letters to us. Therefore, we must read the Bible with our spirit and receive the Bible into our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MUSING UPON THE BIBLE<br />
AND PRAYING OVER IT WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We should muse upon and pray over what we read in the Bible in order to receive it into our spirit. This is the way to combine reading the Bible and prayer. Eventually, it will be difficult to discern whether we are reading the Bible or praying. We will read the Bible when we pray, and we will pray when we read the Bible. Thus the words in the Bible will be spirit and life to us (John 6:63).</p>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE BIBLE AND PRAYING</h2>
<p>Reading the Bible with prayer is the practical way to eat, drink, and enjoy God. If we want to enjoy God, we must read the Bible and pray. Both are indispensable. God has ordained that everything in the universe has two sides. For example, there are heaven and earth, yin and yang, male and female, inside and outside, and left and right. Likewise, in order to enjoy God, we cannot neglect reading the Bible or prayer. Both reading the Bible and prayer must be done simultaneously.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PILLAR OF CLOUD SIGNIFYING THE SPIRIT<br />
AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE SIGNIFYING THE WORD</h2>
<p>The children of Israel experienced the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire in the wilderness (Exo. 13:21-22). The pillar of cloud signifies the Spirit, and the pillar of fire signifies the Word. The pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire are one because both are the embodiment of God, the expression of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING TO BREATHE THE SPIRIT<br />
AND READING THE BIBLE TO ENJOY THE WORD</h2>
<p>God is Spirit, and God is the Word (John 4:24; 1:1); furthermore, His words are spirit (6:63). Prayer is to breathe the Spirit, and reading the Bible is to read the word of God. When we mingle our prayer with reading the Bible, we mingle the word of God with the Spirit and thus receive them into us for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>We can give many messages concerning the enjoyment of God, but these twenty points are a summary of enjoying God. May we grasp these points and spend time to practice them. Then we will have a clear and thorough understanding concerning the enjoyment of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Is it true that God does not want us to do anything for Him?</em></p>
<p>Answer: God does not want man to do anything for Him. This is revealed with the tree of life in Genesis 2. The first mention of a matter in the Bible establishes the principle of that matter. The first time God presented Himself to man, He presented Himself as the tree of life for man to eat, that is, in the form of food. The tree of life unveils that God&rsquo;s relationship with created man did not depend on man doing something for God or on God doing something for man. On the contrary, God desired to be food to man so that man might have life. God wanted man to eat Him and receive Him. God cared for only one thing: to enter into man and be mingled with man to become man&rsquo;s content. This is the vision revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis.</p>
<p>The section of the Bible from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 is not the main line of the Bible. This section is a detour that digresses from the main line. The first two chapters of Genesis should be connected directly to the last two chapters of Revelation. These four chapters of the Bible unveil how God, as the tree of life, desires to enter into man in order to be mingled with man. Hence, in the first two chapters of Genesis we see a blueprint, and in the last two chapters of Revelation we see the completion of God&rsquo;s building and the fulfillment of His desire. In the last two chapters of Revelation God&rsquo;s redeemed people have become a corporate new creation, the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem the river of water of life flows with the tree of life growing along both sides of the river. These allegories show that the New Jerusalem is God mingled with man to be man&rsquo;s content and to be expressed through man. For this reason, we emphasize that the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation are connected as one line. These four chapters are the main line of the Bible.</p>
<p>Some might ask why the detour begins in Genesis 3. This detour begins because man was deceived by Satan to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Consequently, Satan, as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, entered into man and was mixed with man (vv. 1-6). Hence, there is a detour until we come to Revelation 20. In Revelation 20 God deals with and removes the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which was mixed with man. At the end of the detour there is a turn back to the line of the tree of life. The main line of the Bible concerns the tree of life; the detour concerns God&rsquo;s dealing with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In the main line God takes the form of food in order to be man&rsquo;s life and to be mingled with man; on the detour Satan, as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, is mixed with man. God deals with Satan and his relationship with man through the cross (John 12:31-33; 14:30; 16:11).</p>
<p>According to the main line of the Bible, God has no intention for man to do anything for Him, nor does He intend to do anything for man. God&rsquo;s intention is to enter into man and be mingled with man to be man&rsquo;s life and everything to man and then to be expressed through man. If we would see this vision, the divine life will do many things through us without our even having a sense that we have done something for God. Our only realization will be that we are eating and drinking God and that we are letting Him be our life. Even being martyred for the Lord should be an issue of His being our food and our life. If our work is as great as that of the apostle Paul, it should still be a matter of enjoying God. Our work should not be a matter of doing something for God.</p>
<p>If we touch God&rsquo;s intention, we will realize that He does not desire to do anything for man. Rather, He desires to enter into man and be mingled with man to become man&rsquo;s satisfaction, life, and everything. Many experiences will come out of our being mingled with God. On God&rsquo;s side it is not a matter of doing things for man. Rather, it is a matter of His becoming man&rsquo;s food and man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p><em>Question: Madame Guyon and Brother Andrew Murray spoke of fellowship with God. Is this what we are referring to as the enjoyment of God?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The experiences of Madame Guyon and Brother Andrew Murray were rich and deep. In certain aspects our experiences may not be as rich or as deep as theirs. However, the light that they received from the Lord was not complete. Hence, their fellowship to enjoy God involved human effort. Madame Guyon spent much time involved with human effort, and those who receive help from her cannot avoid being ushered into human work. Madame Guyon may be considered a genuine mystic, and when Brother Andrew Murray was raised up by the Lord at the end of the nineteenth century, he accepted the practices of the mystics and made some improvements. Therefore, the light he received concerning spiritual pursuit was more advanced than the light the mystics received. However, we can humbly say that the light he received is not as clear as what we have received. The revelation that God has given to us makes the enjoyment of God very easy. There is no need for human effort. We need only to pray, read the Bible, eat the Lord, drink the Lord, and enjoy the Lord. This is the difference between what we have seen and what Madame Guyon and Brother Andrew Murray saw.</p>
<p><em>Question: Madame Guyon&rsquo;s pursuit for fellowship with the Lord was personal. Should our enjoyment of God also be personal?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The mystics paid much attention to fellowshipping with the Lord, but they made a great mistake of stressing the individual and closed aspects. The more a person is involved with the mystics, the more individualistic and closed his experience becomes, until he completely loses the principle of the Body. In recent years the Lord has shown us the principle of the Body, which is of the Body and of fellowship; this fellowship is neither individualistic nor closed. Furthermore, the Lord has shown us a way to touch Him and a simple way to speak concerning touching Him. Therefore, it does not matter whether we practice enjoying God individually or corporately. An individual can enjoy God, several people can come together to enjoy God, and we can enjoy God even in a big meeting.</p>
<p>Second Timothy 2:22 says that we need to pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Ephesians 3:18 says that we need to apprehend with all the saints the breadth and length and height and depth. Hence, we should reject the individualistic and closed attitude of the mystics. If possible, we should meet with all the saints regularly in order to enjoy God. Such a practice is sweet. The more we practice, the more we will be able to enjoy God in a meeting with many people.</p>
<p>Half a century ago most teachings concerning spiritual pursuit stressed the individual aspect. For example, Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis said that spiritual warfare was a very difficult matter. We now know that the difficulty was in her fighting individually. If spiritual warfare is done in the Body, it becomes easy and effortless. Likewise, if spiritual pursuit is an individual matter, it is difficult, just as spiritual pursuit was difficult for Madame Guyon. However, if spiritual pursuit is practiced according to the principle of the Body, it becomes very easy. Therefore, as much as time allows, the saints should come together regularly for corporate pursuit.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14 the meetings are for absorbing and expressing God. In such meetings the saints come together to absorb God so that He may be expressed. Some saints may pray, and others may give a word of exhortation. It seems that the church has lost this practice. Some believers can touch the presence of God when they pray and read the Bible privately, but they lose His presence when they come to a meeting. As a result, prayer and reading the Bible in Christian meetings carry the flavor of a performance and lack the element of inspiration. The word <em>inspiration</em> in the original language implies breathing. Hence, inspiration is the breathing of the Spirit. When we come together, our praying and reading of the Bible should come from breathing the Spirit. The words of encouragement that we speak should also come from breathing the Spirit. This is the practical way to eat, drink, absorb, and express God.</p></body></html>
