   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A GOLDEN CITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The basic element of the city proper is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The city itself is gold Rev 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have pointed out, this city is a mountain of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Gold signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fact that the New Jerusalem is a golden city signifies that the entire city is constituted with the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Likewise, the basic element of the church today is the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church is constituted with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE PEARL GATES</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The twelve gates of New Jerusalem are twelve pearls Rev 21:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fact that the twelve gates of the holy city are twelve pearls signifies that regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-secreting Christ is the entrance into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 3:3 and 5 the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus that unless a man was born again he could not enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Regeneration is the entrance into the kingdom, the entrance into this city.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all have been regenerated and have passed through this gate into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our regeneration was our entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE GOLDEN STREET</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After entering in through the gates, we find ourselves on the golden street Rev 21:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This signifies that our way, our street, is God s golden nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything we do must correspond to the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the sisters ask me what color and style of clothing they should wear, I would say that the color and style of their clothing must be according to the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The divine nature is their way, their street.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you ask me what your hair style should be, I would also say that it must be according to the golden street, according to God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After we have been regenerated, we walk on the golden street, that is, we walk according to God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A COMPOSITION OF PRECIOUS STONES</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>New Jerusalem is a composition of precious stones Rev 21:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Precious stones are the result of transformation, and they are produced by heat and pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through intense heat and great pressure a natural substance becomes a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After we are regenerated, we begin to be burned and pressed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This heat and pressure will eventually transform us into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At present, some are not yet very precious; they still have some dust on them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But we all are in the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am fully assured that when we enter into the New Jerusalem, there will no longer be any dust or clay, only precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Pearls signify regeneration, and precious stones signify transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After we have been regenerated, we must undergo the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise the Lord that we have been regenerated and have passed through the pearl gate!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord that we are also becoming precious stones!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many are still somewhat muddy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a previous message I pointed out that some of you are wafers and that, because you are wafers, I dare not touch you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Pouring water on a wafer causes it to disintegrate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I know whether or not I can touch you and how much water I can pour on you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are muddy and I pour water upon you, you will be all the more muddy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if you are a precious stone and I pour water on you, you will not be affected at all.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One day we shall no longer be muddy; rather, we shall be jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through transformation we shall become precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The precious stones in New Jerusalem are not piled one upon another; instead, they are built together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, the precious stones in this city signify not only transformation, but also building.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the church life today we are daily being transformed and built together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A few years ago there was little of the building in Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But in Stuttgart today there is some amount of building.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have not been only transformed, but also built together.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, the precious stones constituting the wall of the New Jerusalem signify both transformation and building.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE APPEARANCE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Revelation 21:11 says, Her light was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Jasper signifies the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Revelation 4:3 we see that the One sitting on the throne has the appearance of jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now in chapter twenty-one we see that the appearance of the whole city is the appearance of jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that the entire city bears the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the precious stones built together signify three things: transformation, building, and the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In both the Old Testament and New Testament, we have transformation, building, and the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Ultimately, these three positive things will be found in New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the New Jerusalem we have transformation, building, and the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We also have the walk of holiness signified by the golden street.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As we have seen, after we enter in through the gate, we walk along the golden street.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This walk along the golden street is a holy walk, a walk of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, we have regeneration, the holy walk, building, and the expression of God.</S>
