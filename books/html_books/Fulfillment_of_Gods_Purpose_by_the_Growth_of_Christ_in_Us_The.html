This is why at the beginning of the Bible we are told that God created man in His own image and gave man His dominion, the authority over all things (Gen. 1:26). God created man in His own image with the purpose that man may express Him, and God gave man His dominion over all things that man may conquer the earth and subdue His enemy. Then when we come to the end of the Bible, we see there is a city, and the city is in the appearance of God (Rev. 21:11; cf. 4:3). The city looks the same as God. That is a city of living beings composed together as God's corporate expression, the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the composition of all the redeemed ones built together as a corporate body to express God, bearing the very appearance of God. Through that city the earth will be fully conquered and all God's enemies will be subdued. The enemy of God will be put into the lake of fire (20:10). Thus, the Bible concludes with God being fully expressed through His regenerated, transformed, and glorified people, and with His enemy being thoroughly conquered and subdued.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR RELIGIOUS CONCEPT VERSUS GOD'S INTENTION</H2><P>Now we have to see how God can accomplish His purpose. Before we see this, however, I have to point out one thing. Our religious concept always damages God's purpose. This religious concept is that we have to do something to please God by correcting ourselves, adjusting ourselves, and improving ourselves. We think that we have to do many good things in order to please God. This religious concept is very prevailing even today in Christianity. I look to the Lord that we will drop this damaging concept.</P><P>God's purpose is divine and high. No human being can fulfill it. Do you think you can fulfill God's purpose? God's purpose, positively, is to express Himself. How could you express God? It is impossible. God has no intention to ask you to do this good thing or that good thing. It might be good in your eyes, but it is so poor in His eyes.</P><P>When God created Adam, He did not tell him that he had to do certain things to please God or to glorify Him. Instead, God put man in front of the tree of life and told him to be careful to eat the right thing (Gen. 2:8-9, 16-17). That means that man had to eat the tree of life. Besides the tree of life, there was another tree, the tree of knowledge. Man has to be careful. If he eats the wrong thing, the tree of knowledge, surely he will die (v. 17). It is not a matter of right or wrong, good or bad; it is a matter of life or death. If you eat the right thing, you get life; if you eat the wrong thing, you get death.</P><P>God has no intention to ask you to do something right. The right thing and the wrong thing are in different categories according to our concept. But to God both right and wrong are in the same category. The tree of life is one category and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is another. Thus, God classifies good and evil in the same category. You may think religiously that your good is really good, but God says, "Your good is just as bad as your evil. I never credit your good to your account; I always debit your good to your account just like I debit your evil." Good and evil are not on the credit side, but on the debit side. God has no intention to care for good or evil. God's intention is just to care for life. All that you need is life.</P><P>Let us use a dog as an illustration. Whether this is a good dog or a bad dog, it is still a dog. Whether it is naughty or it behaves, it is still a dog. When it is dirty, it is a dog; when it is clean, it is still a dog. Its life and nature have not changed. In the same way, whether we are good or bad, our life and nature are still the same. This is why we have to give up the religious concept.</P><P>God's intention is that He may come into man as another life to be man's life. God has no intention to ask you to do good, just as He has no intention to ask you to do evil. His intention is just to ask you to take Him in as life. Only He as life within us can express Himself. We cannot express God; only God Himself can express God. We need God as our life. We think that God is someone over us, above us, beside us, or behind us to support, help, and sustain us. In a sense, this is not wrong, but this is not God's central way. God's central way is to get into man to be man's life. This is why God made things so simple by putting man in front of the tree of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LIFE OF GOD BEING THE CENTER OF THE BIBLE</H2><P>In the first two chapters of the Bible, life is the center. They tell us that God created the heavens and the earth with millions of items (Gen. 1:1). Then in the center God created man and put this central creature in front of the tree of life. So the tree of life became the very center of God's universe, as far as man was concerned. Science has found out that the earth is unique in the universe. It is different from all other planets because only the earth has life. God created the heavens for the earth. Upon this earth God planted a garden, and in this garden the tree of life is the center. Thus, life is the center of God's universe. After being created, man was put in front of this tree of life, facing the central thing of God's universe. In the last two chapters of the Bible, life is also the center. Within the new heaven and the new earth is the New Jerusalem, and within the New Jerusalem, the tree of life is the center (Rev. 22:1-2). This shows us that life is the center of the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FATHER, THE SON, THE SPIRIT,<br>AND THE WORD BEING LIFE TO US</H2><P>The Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the Word are life. Ephesians 4:18 speaks of "the life of God." It says that the Gentiles, the unbelievers, are alienated from the life of God. This proves that God's intention is that we human beings may have God's life. It is a great thing for us to have the life of God. What a wonder it would be if a dog could have the life of a man! If such a thing could happen, this would be the top news on earth, and everyone would want to see this. Of course, this cannot happen. But praise the Lord, we human beings can have the life of God! God is the Divine Being, the almighty Creator, and we are just little creatures, yet we can have the life of God. The best relationship you can have with God is a relationship of life. You need God's life, and this is God's intention.</P><P>The Bible also reveals that God the Son is life. In Him was life (John 1:4), He is life (14:6a), and He came that we may have life and have it abundantly (10:10b). Christ is our life (Col. 3:4a). When I was a young Christian, I heard that Christ is our Savior, but I was not told that He is also our life. Christ being our Savior is for the purpose that we may have Him as our life. His being the Savior is not the goal. Life is the goal. Many know Christ as the Savior, but very few know Christ as life in a practical and daily way. God the Father is life to us, and God the Son is life to us also. We need to have Him as our life.</P><P>Furthermore, God the Spirit is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). The Spirit gives life (2 Cor. 3:6b). In Christianity people speak of the Holy Spirit as an instrument or a power, but there is very little talk about the Spirit as life. Christianity has missed and is still missing the mark of God. Many speak about Christ as the Savior and Redeemer, but very few speak about Christ as life. They may speak about the Spirit as a power or an instrument to fulfill God's purpose, but they do not speak about the Spirit as life to us. Romans 8:2 speaks of the Spirit of life. Second Corinthians 3:6 tells us that the Spirit gives life. God the Father is life, God the Son is life, and God the Spirit is also life. The Triune God is life to us.</P><P>The Word is also life to us. Christianity has made the Bible a book of knowledge full of teachings, but actually it is a book of life. The Bible speaks of the Word of life (1 John 1:1). Also, the words the Lord speaks to us are spirit and are life (John 6:63). The Bible is the Word of life, not the word of knowledge or teaching. Peter was told to go to the people and speak to them the words of life (Acts 5:20), not the words of teaching, doctrine, or knowledge. God is life, God the Son is life, God the Spirit is life, and the Word is life. The God whom we have&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;is life to us. God the Father is in the Son (John 14:10), the Son is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), and this Spirit today is within us as life to us. God has also given us the Bible, and this holy Book also is life to us. We have the Holy Spirit within as life and we have the Holy Bible without also as life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW TO TAKE GOD INTO US AS LIFE</H2><P>We cannot fulfill God's purpose, because His purpose is so divine and we are so human. It is impossible for us human beings to fulfill the divine purpose. But God's intention is that He be taken into us as our life. We need to help people realize how we can take God in as our life. God the Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit is within us. We received the Spirit of life into us when we repented to the Lord, believed into Him, and called upon His name. When we heard the gospel, we called, "O Lord Jesus." We did this because the Bible tells us we have to call on the name of the Lord. "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" (Rom. 10:13). When we heard the gospel, many of us did have a kind of desire to call on the Lord. We may have called by saying, "O Lord Jesus," "Jesus," "O Lord," or "Jesus Christ." When you call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, that is according to the Bible and according to the inspiration within you.</P><P>The Holy Spirit within you is absolutely one with the Holy Bible outside of you. What you need is to mingle the Holy Spirit within with the Holy Bible without. You need to open up your mouth and say from deep within, "O Lord Jesus." Here is the principle of how to mingle the Spirit with the Bible, making the Holy Bible one with the Holy Spirit. Eventually, the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word (Eph. 6:17).</P><P>The Spirit is the consummate Person of the Godhead, because the Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit comes into us. The Bible is the breath of God. All the Scripture is God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16). The breath of God is also the Spirit (John 20:22). Thus, we have the Holy Spirit within us as the consummate Person of the Godhead, and we have the Bible in our hand, both as God's divine breath. These two items are waiting for our calling on the name of the Lord.</P><P>This is why we need pray-reading. Pray-reading is the best way of calling. To pray is to utter something from the Spirit within. To read is to repeat what is written in the Holy Bible. We need praying and reading mingled together as one, that is, pray-reading. This is the best way to mingle the Holy Spirit with the Holy Bible into one, and this is the best way to make the Holy Bible one with the Holy Spirit. By this pray-reading, by this way of mingling the Bible with the Spirit as one, we take God into us again and again. We enjoy Him as our food (John 6:57).</P><P>My burden is not to pass on more knowledge to you. My burden is to point out to you the prevailing way that you can enjoy God, that you can take God into you, not only as life but also as the life supply. What you need today is just to take God into you again and again. All that we need is the Triune God: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. Do not think that the Bible is a book of knowledge. The Bible is the embodiment of God's divine breath. God's divine breath is condensed in the Bible. God's intention is not to pass on knowledge through the Bible; God's intention is to pass on Himself through the Bible. We take God into us through the Bible by pray-reading. The more you pray-read, the more you breathe God in. The more you pray-read, the more you drink of Him (John 7:37). The more you pray-read, the more you eat of Him (Jer. 15:16). In other words, the more you pray-read, the more you take Him in. When God gets into you, He will do a lot of things. The divine life operates within us in many things to fulfill God's purpose (Phil. 2:13).</P><P>We need to drop the religious concept and come back to God's concept. What we need is just to take Him in, and the way to take Him in is to mingle the Holy Spirit with the Holy Bible as one. Then we may enjoy all the riches of the Godhead as our life and as our life supply.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HOW TO TAKE CHRIST AS OUR LIFE</H1><P>We have seen that only God Himself as life within us can fulfill His divine purpose. God has no intention to ask us to do something for Him. God's intention is for us to take Him as life into us. Then He as our life will work out many things from within us. God's intention is that He could be life to us, but we need to see how we can take Him as life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GOSPEL OF JOHN BEING A BOOK OF LIFE</H2><P>The Gospel of John is a book of life. It tells us that Christ came that we may have life and have it abundantly (10:10). John tells us what Christ is and how we can take Christ as life. Christ is many things to us in the book of John, such as the light (8:12), the life, the way (14:6a), the door (10:9), the bread of life (6:35), the living water (4:10, 14), etc. But these are just the items of what Christ is, not the substance, the essence.</P><P>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God." Christ is the Word (v. 14). John also says that this very Christ who is the Word and who is God is Spirit. John 4:24 says, "God is Spirit." We need to combine John 4:24 with 1:1. Christ is God, Christ is the Word, and Christ is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Christ is God as the source, Christ is the Word as the element, and Christ is the Spirit as the essence. So if we are going to take Christ as life, we have to contact the Spirit and the Word. Without contacting the Spirit and the Word, there is no way for us to take Christ as life.</P><P>Christ is the bread of life, the spiritual food, but you need to contact the Spirit and the Word so that you can get this food. Without contacting the Spirit and the Word, there is no way for you to take the food. Christ is also the light. If you are going to enjoy the light, you need to contact the Spirit and the Word. Without contacting the Spirit and the Word, there is no way for you to get the light.</P><P>Christ as the all-inclusive One is the Spirit within us and the Word outside of us. We have the Spirit within and the Word without. These are not two separate things, but two aspects of one thing. This one thing is Christ Himself as God. Within us is the Spirit and outside of us is the Bible, the Word. In this substance, this divine element, are all the items of what Christ is: the life, the light, the food, the water, the air, etc. All are items of the same substance, which is the Spirit, the Word, and God. Christ is God! Christ is the Spirit! And Christ is the Word! We have Christ today as God the Spirit within us and as the Word outside of us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EATING, DRINKING, AND BREATHING CHRIST</H2><P>The Gospel of John tells us the way to take this very Christ, who is God as the Spirit and as the Word. The first way is by eating. This is revealed in chapter six. The Lord said, "I am the bread of life...he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" (vv. 35, 57). The way to take Christ is to eat Him. Christ is eatable. Some may think that it is too wild or crude to say that we have to eat Christ. But the Lord Himself told us to eat Him. Only the things that we eat, that we take into us as food, can be our life supply.</P><P>One day the Lord Jesus said, "I am the bread of life...eat Me." This was simple to such an extent that it bothered and puzzled even many of His disciples. They said to one another, "This word is hard; who can hear it?" (v. 60). They did not understand how they could eat Him. The Lord was simple to such an extent that people would not believe.</P><P>Also today it is so simple to be saved and have Christ within us as our life. "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" (Rom. 10:13). It seems hard to believe that we could be saved in such a simple way. It is so marvelous, yet so simple. When God created man, He did not give man many instructions about how to behave himself. God only put him in front of the tree of life that he might take in the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9). This is the unique thing we need. We need to take in Christ. We need to eat Christ. This is why we have to know that Christ is the Spirit and the Word. Where is Christ? Christ is in the Spirit and Christ is in the Word. We surely know that Christ is in the heavens, but if He were only in the heavens, we could not eat Him. He would be too far away from us. Christ today is the Spirit and is the Word. Whenever I touch the Spirit and contact the Word, I eat Christ.</P><P>Eating Christ is revealed in John 6, and drinking Him is revealed in chapter seven. The Lord said, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink" (v. 37). Following the eating is the drinking. To eat is to take in the bread. To drink is to take in the water. So we need the eating and the drinking. But this is not all. At the end of the Gospel of John, in 20:22, there is the breathing. We need eating, drinking, and breathing. After the Lord was resurrected, He came back to His disciples, breathed into them, and asked them to receive the holy breath.</P><P>I say again, in this book we are told what Christ is, and we are also told how we can take this Christ in. He is the very God, He is the Spirit, and He is the Word. We can take Him in by eating, drinking, and breathing. We have to eat, drink, and breathe Christ day by day to sustain our spiritual life. It is so simple.</P><P>Hymns, #255 by A. B. Simpson is a hymn on breathing in the Lord. The chorus of this hymn says:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>I am breathing out my sorrow,<br>Breathing out my sin;<br>I am breathing, breathing, breathing,<br>All Thy fulness in.</P><P>The first time I introduced this hymn was in 1963. There was a brother among us then who had a Brethren background. When he first heard this hymn, he did not like it because it was against his religious concept. But eventually this brother learned how to breathe in the Lord, and he appreciated this hymn. We can never give up breathing. Breathing is simple, but it is not simple to explain.</P><P>Today the Lord is the Spirit, and He is also the Word. On the one hand, the Spirit is the pneuma, the breath (John 20:22). On the other hand, the Word is also the breath. Second Timothy 3:16 says that all Scripture is God-breathed. So every part of the Scripture is a part of the divine breath. As the Spirit and the Word, the Lord is the breath. Strictly speaking, you can never get the Word into you as life merely by reading it. The only way for you to get the Word into you as life is by breathing. All Scripture is God-breathed. If you are going to get the Word as the breath into you, you have to breathe. Of course, we need to read the Bible, but mere reading does not work. We have to read the Word by breathing.</P><P>Let me illustrate a little bit to you. John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. If I merely read this verse, nothing will happen. But if I breathe in this verse by pray-reading through calling on the name of the Lord, the Lord will come into me. You need prayer to match your reading, prayer to mingle with your reading. While you are reading, you need to pray. This prayer is your breathing, and this breathing is by calling upon the name of the Lord.</P><P>Ephesians 5:22 says that the wives should submit themselves to their own husbands. Many wives appreciate others' husbands, but the Lord tells them to submit themselves to their own husbands. After reading this verse a number of times, a sister may make up her mind to submit herself to her own husband. But this does not work. She received the word in black and white and gained knowledge in her mind, but she did not get life. The way to take this word into us as life is to mingle our reading with prayer. A sister could pray, "O Lord, wives. O Lord, wives. Submit yourselves. O Lord. Lord, I can't submit. To your own husband. O Lord, I can submit to others' husbands, but not to my own. O Lord! O Lord, I need You to be my person!" When you mingle your reading with prayer in this way, you receive the Lord as life. I would advise you never to make up your mind to submit. That is a kind of temptation. When you make up your mind to submit, you have turned from the tree of life to the tree of knowledge. But when you read the Word with prayer, this is the feeding on the tree of life.</P><P>Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ. But if you make up your mind to reckon yourself dead, this will not work. No verse of the Bible will work in this way. This is the wrong way. You cannot take the Word into you as life by mere reading. Many Christians read the Bible, but their lives have remained the same for many years. Many Bible readers have gotten a lot of knowledge from the Bible, but no life. Thus, there is no transformation, no inward, metabolic change. This is because they have made the word of the Bible the letter, and the letter kills (2 Cor. 3:6). They make the book of life a book of knowledge. Knowledge puffs up (1 Cor. 8:1), and knowledge brings in death. The right way is to read the Word by breathing, to read the Word by calling on the name of the Lord, so that we may make the Word one with the Spirit.</P><P>The secret, the key, is the calling, because calling on the name of the Lord is the breathing (Lam. 3:55-56). We all need to call on the name of the Lord. Whenever you read any verse, any chapter, or any portion of the Bible, you have to call on the name of the Lord. All the time mingle your reading with your calling. Mere reading does not work. You have to turn your reading into praying by calling on the name of the Lord.</P><P>The proper pray-reading with the calling on the name of the Lord really nourishes us. When we breathe in the Lord, we also receive Him as our food and drink. The food is one with the water, and the water is one with the breath. Within the breath is the water, and within the water is the food. This is revealed clearly throughout the whole Bible. The tree of life as food grows in the water of life (Rev. 22:1-2). This proves the food is in the water. Also, the water is in the breath. So when we breathe in the breath, we get the water. Thus, with the breathing, there is the drinking, and with the drinking, there is the eating. The eating and the drinking are included in the breathing, and the breathing is our calling on the name of the Lord.</P><P>First Corinthians also shows us the eating, the drinking, and the calling. Chapter ten says that we eat the same spiritual food and drink the same spiritual drink (vv. 3-4). Then chapter twelve shows that we all have been made to drink of one Spirit (v. 13) by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. No one can say, "Lord Jesus," but in the Holy Spirit (v. 3). In other words, whenever you say, "Lord Jesus," you are drinking of the Spirit. If you merely read the Word without calling on His name, you cannot get the nourishment. But if you call on the Lord, you experience the refreshing, the watering, and the nourishing. On the other hand, if you merely call on the name of the Lord, you still miss something. You need the Word to match your calling. This is the way to breathe, drink, and eat, to take Christ in as our air, water, and food. Then we enjoy Him as our abundant life.</P><P>We cannot stay away from the Word and the Spirit. We have the Spirit within and the Word without. Today we have these two greatest gifts as our wealth. We can receive these gifts by mingling our reading with praying and our calling on the name of the Lord. Whenever you read the Bible, you have to pray and call on the name of the Lord. It is by this calling that you breathe, by this breathing that you drink, and by this drinking that you eat the Lord. We need to mingle these three things together: calling, praying, and reading. We need to make these three things one.</P><P>I would advise you that whenever you touch the word of the Bible, right away you have to call on the name of the Lord. You should have the strong sensation that if you merely read the Word without calling on the name of the Lord, that is a big loss. Whenever you open up the Word and read it, right away you have to call on the name of the Lord. It is by this that you breathe. When you breathe, you drink, and when you drink, you eat. The Word gets into you as life and as life supply. Then the Word will be one with the Spirit within you to refresh you, to water you, to nourish you, and to give you the growth. It is by this that we take the Lord in again and again.</P><P>Make calling, praying, and reading three-in-one. Then it will be hard to discern whether you are reading, praying, or calling on the name of the Lord. While you are calling, you are praying; while you are praying, you are reading; while you are reading, you are praying; while you are praying, you are calling. Then the word of the Bible becomes spirit and life to you (John 6:63). It is by this way that we take the Lord into us all the time. This is absolutely different from today's Christian religion.</P><P>Even in the book of Revelation, there is the same concept of taking in the Lord. The Lord says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life" (2:7). Then He says, "Let him who wills take the water of life freely" (22:17). To eat of the tree of life and to drink of the water of life are the main aspects in the book of Revelation. This book at the conclusion of the whole Bible shows that out of the redeeming God flows the river of water of life, and in the river of water of life grows the tree of life (22:1-2). The river of water of life is flowing, and the tree of life is growing.</P><P>At the end of the whole Bible, the last call from God is a call to take the water of life freely (22:17). The Spirit and the bride yearn that the thirsty ones would come to take the water of life for their satisfaction. When you drink the water, you get the food. This is God's final call, and this will produce the new city, the holy city, the New Jerusalem. All that we need is to come and drink the water of life that we may feed on Christ as the tree of life. This will produce the Body of Christ, the church life, the local churches, and ultimately the holy city, New Jerusalem.</P><P>Now we have seen the secret of how to take in Christ, that is, to breathe Him, to drink Him, and to eat Him. The way is by calling upon Him and praying and reading, by mingling these three things together as one. This is the way to contact the Spirit and touch the Word. In this way we can participate in Christ all the time. Christ today is the air, the water, and the food. After He gets into us, He will do a lot of things. We must be willing to put aside our old concept and learn to call upon the name of the Lord, to pray by reading, and to read by praying. We must learn to mingle calling, reading, and praying into one. Then we will enjoy Christ and take Christ into us day by day. This will accomplish many things within us to fulfill God's eternal purpose.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WAY TO HAVE THE GROWTH<br>OF CHRIST WITHIN US</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:6-7; Mark 4:14-20; Eph. 4:15, 13m; 2:21; 1 Pet. 2:2-3, 5; Col. 2:19; 2 Pet. 1:1, 3-4; 3:18; 2 Cor. 3:17-18</H1><P>We have seen that God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Word are all life to us. Furthermore, we have seen that the way to take in God is by contacting the Spirit and the Word through calling on the Lord in prayer. This is the spiritual breathing, drinking, and eating. We eat by drinking, drink by breathing, and breathe by calling on the name of the Lord. Whenever we call on the Lord by praying and reading the Word, we take the Lord into us. The Lord today is in the Spirit and in the Word, and He even is the Spirit and the Word. Both the Spirit and the Word are the breath of God. The Spirit is the pneuma, the breath, and the Word is God's divine breath. So the way for us to take in the Word and the Spirit is to breathe, and the way to breathe is to call on the Lord. This is so clear and simple, yet so real and rich.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GROWTH OF LIFE</H2><P>In this chapter we want to go on to see that life grows. Anything living always grows, and growth is the issue of life. There is always some issue that comes out of life. The first issue of life is growth. All forms of life&#151;the human life, animal life, and vegetable life&#151;exhibit growth. The divine life is the same. The divine life is the highest life, the life on the highest plane. Because the divine life is the highest life, it has the highest growth.</P><P>Paul said, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth" (1 Cor. 3:6). I wish to say a word to all the dear ones who are serving the Lord. We have to listen to the apostle Paul. He said, "I planted." He did not say, "I taught." With mere teaching nothing grows. But anything planted is something of life. With life there is growth. So we Christian workers have to learn not to merely teach, but to plant.</P><P>Paul also said that Apollos watered. Today among the Christians teaching and edification are spoken about. But how many speak about our need to be watered? We need to water the brothers, not merely edify them. The brothers need the watering. The dry plants need the watering. We need to change our terminology from edifying to watering. Brothers, I need your watering.</P><P>If you always come to a plant to edify and correct it, the plant will die. Instead, you should water it. In the same way, we should not try to correct the brothers. Instead, we should water them. In a sense, we should let them be wrong. Just water them. Do not say, "Brother, you shouldn't be like this. You are too much in your anger. You need some correction." If you do this, you will kill him. What he needs is not correction but watering. A brother's anger is like a germ. Sometimes the germ has to come out. If the germ is kept in, it kills. This brother needs to be watered. Christ is life, and life needs the planting and the watering. Christianity today has become a religion. A religion needs teaching and correcting, but Christ is the life. Paul said that he planted and Apollos watered. Following this, God came in to give the growth.</P><P>I am happy to see that many young ones among us are growing. Some came to me with a concern about the young men with long hair and beards who have come to our meetings, but we just need to water them. The more Christ grows within them, the more the long hair and beards will be gone. This is not by teaching but by growth, and the growth needs the watering. Just water people and be patient. Do not correct others in a quick way. That really kills. Water them so that they may grow.</P><P>In a sense, growth is not so fast. The mothers with children know this. Today is about the same as yesterday, and tomorrow will be about the same as today as far as the growth of their children is concerned. When we look at our children day by day, every day they seem to be the same. But praise the Lord, after one year and another year, they are not the same. After a certain period of time, the growth can be seen. Life grows. It seems quite slow, but actually it is really fast. A mother mainly feeds her children, and this is what causes the growth.</P><P>First Corinthians 3:9 says that the church is God's farm, God's cultivated land. The farm, the church, grows Christ. Over the years we have seen the growth of Christ in many dear ones. They have been transformed, not by teaching but by growing. We have to check with ourselves. When we say that we take in Christ as life, what is the issue? Of course, we cannot expect to be full-grown in a quick way, but after a period of time, we should be able to see some difference.</P><P>You have been calling on the Lord for a while, but has there been any growth? If you are still the same as you were six weeks ago, I am concerned for you. If you remain the same, that means there is the shortage of growth. If you eat properly, without any illness, be sure that after six weeks you will show forth your growth. We all need to grow. If we do mean business in calling on the name of the Lord, I am sure that there will be growth. If there is no growth, something is wrong. It is impossible for there to be no issue of growth if we are taking in Christ day by day.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOUR CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE<br>RELATED TO THE GROWTH OF LIFE</H2><P>In Mark 4 the Lord Jesus Himself illustrated very clearly that there are four kinds of people related to the growth in life. The Lord's illustration shows us what kind of person can have the proper growth in life. The Lord revealed that He is both the Sower and the seed (vv. 3, 14). He is the Sower who came to sow Himself as the seed into human beings. But these humans beings are categorized into four classes of people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Wayside</H2><P>The first category of people is like the wayside (v. 15). This refers to a place close to the way. It is hardened by the traffic of the way; thus, it is difficult for the seed of life to penetrate it. This is a picture of a person who is close to the world, with much worldly traffic within him. This means that his heart has been hardened by worldly traffic. Some of us have too much traffic with this world. This makes it hard for the seed of life to get into us. The seed sown beside the way can be snatched away by the birds, who signify Satan as the evil bird in the air who right away comes to snatch away the word from the hardened heart (vv. 4, 15). You may listen to the word, and yet there may be no opening within you because your heart is hardened like the wayside. Of course, if this is the case, life cannot grow within you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Stony Ground</H2><P>The second category is the stony ground (vv. 5-6). The soil seems soft, but underneath are some hidden rocks. Our heart is quite deceitful. Sometimes even we ourselves do not understand what is hidden underneath in our heart (Jer. 17:9). There may be something impure hidden within us. Apparently, we are good for the word; we are seeking the Lord and are for the Lord's move, but something as a stone may be hidden underneath within us as an impure motive, intention, purpose, or desire.</P><P>Throughout the years I have seen many young people come into the church life. Apparently, they were so seeking and good, but there was a kind of motive hidden in their heart. You may be seeking Christ apparently, but actually something may be hidden in your heart. When you gain what you want, you will be very happy and praise the Lord. But if you are not successful in that aim, you will be disappointed and want to give up the church life. Then there is no growth because there is no root. Deep within the heart there may be rocks, which can be hidden sins, personal desires, self-seeking, and self-pity, which hinder the seed from taking root in the depths of the heart. Then when the sun comes with its scorching heat, signifying affliction or persecution, the seed withers because it has no root (Mark 4:6, 16-17). You may come into the church life with something hidden, with a certain aim, ambition, or desire. After a while you may have the deep sensation that you have failed in your aim. Then when any kind of affliction comes, this will become a deathblow to the growth of the seed within you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Thorny Ground</H2><P>The third category is the thorny ground (v. 7). The thorns choke the growth of life. The Lord Jesus told us that the thorns signify three things: the anxieties of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts for other things (v. 19). People today are caught up with this age. They are never satisfied with what they have. If they have an older car, they want a newer one. If they live in a house, they want a better house. These are the cares of the age. To a seeker of Christ, a seeking one in the church life, it makes no difference what kind of car or dwelling he has. All the cares of the age choke the growth.</P><P>Many of the young Chinese who come to this country are so ambitious to get a doctor's degree. The young people surely have to study, but they should not study so ambitiously to the extent that they make education their goal and not the Lord. Even with those of us who have a job, we should try to work eight hours a day and five days a week, leaving the rest of our time for the church life. We should do a good job, but we should not care for overtime or for promotions. We would never be cheated by the deceitfulness of riches.</P><P>If you sell yourself to your job to get a promotion, your job becomes Pharaoh to you. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, makes the people of God very busy so that they do not have time for God's interests. A brother may get a doctor's degree or receive a good promotion, but this may cause him to be too busy to practice the church life. He may have to work day and night to sell himself for his job, for his promotion. Then how can he grow in life? This is the deceitfulness of riches.</P><P>Do we really need that much money? We need to simplify our life. Do not be a slave to make money or a slave to spend money. You have to spend much of your energy to make money and then more time to spend the money. If you make less money, you will save your time in spending money. The ones who spend much time to make money are enslaved. They spend more energy in spending money, and then they spend more time in using the things they buy. They have time for everything but no time for the Lord. This is the deceitfulness of riches.</P><P>We need to be simple in making money, in using money, and in using things that are bought by money. If we do not make that much money, we do not need to spend that much money, and we do not need more time to use the things we buy with the money. So we are so simple in the world. We are so free, liberated, and simplified for the Lord. We have plenty of time for the Lord and for the church life.</P><P>We should just spend enough time on our job to make a living. All the rest of our hours should be for the Lord and for the church life. In this way, it is so easy for the life within us to grow because nothing is choking it. We also have to beware of the lusts, or the desires, for other things. Maybe your goal and desire are to have a doctor's degree. That could be a lust which can choke the life within you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Good Ground</H2><P>By His mercy we would not be the wayside, the stony ground, or the thorny ground. We want to be the good ground (vv. 8, 20). In our mind, in our heart, and in our spirit, there should be no worldly traffic. We should have nothing impure hidden within us. We should not care for the things of this age, and we must overcome the deceitfulness of riches. We must be above mammon and have only one desire. Christ and the church are our unique desire. This is the good ground, which is fully available for the growth of the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INCREASE OF CHRIST WITHIN US</H2><P>Now we have to go on to see something positive. The real growth is the growth of God, the increase of God, within us. Colossians 2:19 says that we grow with the growth of God. We all have God within us. That means we all have Christ within us. But how much of Christ do we have? We should have Christ as the very God filling up our entire being, so we all need to grow with the growth of God, the increase of God. God needs to be increased within us. The more increase of God we have, the more growth we have. We can have Christ increased within us by calling on His name, praying to Him, and pray-reading His word. Then we will grow up into Christ in all things, not just in some things (Eph. 4:15). We need to have the increase of God day by day so that we may grow up into Christ in everything.</P><P>Now you are in Christ, but not in everything. You are in Christ just in a general way. In so many things, you are not in Christ yet. On the negative side, we should not be the wayside, the stony ground, or the thorny ground; we need to be the good ground, without worldly traffic, without the hidden stones, without the cares of this age, the deceitfulness of mammon, and without the desire for other things which choke the growth of life. We have to be the good ground, freed from all kinds of preoccupations that we may have the growth. Then we will have the increase of God to grow up into Christ in all things.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ENJOYING CHRIST BY CALLING<br>ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 2:17a, 21; Rom. 10:6b-9, 12-13; Acts 9:14; 2 Tim. 2:22; 1 Cor. 1:2, 9, 24; 12:3, 13</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXPRESSING GOD AND CONQUERING<br>HIS ENEMY IN OUR DAILY LIFE</H2><P>We have seen that God's purpose is to express Himself and to conquer His enemy. Whatever we do in our Christian life must be for this purpose. Let us use the illustration of wives submitting themselves to their own husbands (Eph. 5:22). Even in this matter, there are these two aspects: expressing God and conquering God's enemy. If a sister who is a wife would not be willing to submit herself to her husband, this kind of rebellion would be a glory to Satan and a shame to God. But if the dear sister would be willing and able to submit herself to her own husband, this would be a glory to God and a shame to Satan. When a sister submits herself by enjoying the Lord within her, spontaneously she expresses God. God is expressed in her submission, and spontaneously Satan is conquered. The enemy, the devil, the evil one, is subdued. If a wife and husband are fighting each other, God is put to shame. God is not expressed. But if a sister submits to her husband out of her enjoyment of Christ, you can see Christ expressed in her submission.</P><P>Even in the smallest things in our daily walk, we need to express God. If we enjoy the Lord day by day, we will be dealt with by the Lord in the way that we dress. Something in us will be touched. When you are calling on the Lord, the Lord may say, "What kind of tie is this that you are wearing?" As you are combing your hair, the Lord would say, "How will you comb your hair?" The Lord will touch us in these little things as we remain in the fellowship with Him. Eventually, the way we dress will be the expression of God. Even in our dress, the enemy, the evil one, will be subdued. In the way that some people dress, you can see the darkness of Satan. Everything of our daily walk is either the expression of God or the expression of Satan. Either the enemy is subdued or he is prevailing.</P><P>But we also need to remember that the Christian life is not a matter of outward correction. Outward correction is not something of life. It is like the work of morticians, the work of outward decoration. They can make a corpse look presentable outwardly, but this is not the transformation of life. The transformation of life comes from within. As we call on the Lord, pray to Him, and pray-read His word, we enjoy Christ as life, and this life transforms us.</P><P>If we do everything in our daily life by enjoying the Lord, whatever we do will be the expression of God and the subduing of His enemy. Suppose another brother rebuked you, and yet you were so patient with him, without losing your temper, by the enjoyment of Christ. Others would be able to realize the expression of Christ and the conquering of the enemy with you. But this should not be your doing. This must be Christ's doing through your enjoyment of Him. Do not try to do anything by yourself. Never try to express God by yourself. Never try to conquer, to subdue, the enemy by yourself. If you try to conquer him, be sure that you will be conquered. We can never face our enemy, because we are not adequate. But praise Him, we have Christ as our life. Christ must get into us as our life so that He can live Himself through us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW CHRIST GETS INTO US</H2><P>Now we have to ask again, "How can Christ get into us?" We have the Holy Spirit within us and the Holy Bible in our hand. The Holy Spirit within us is actually the wonderful Christ, the all-inclusive Christ, the compounded Christ. When I say the compounded Christ, I mean that now this Christ is no more simply God. He is God but also man. He was God incarnated to be a man, and now He still has the human nature. He is divine as well as human. He is compounded. He also went to the cross and was crucified. He walked into death, through death, and out of death. He was not captured by death. He conquered death, subdued death, and walked out of death. Then He was resurrected, and He ascended to the heavens, where He was enthroned. He has accomplished all these things and has attained the highest place in the universe. His accomplishment is a complete accomplishment, and His attainment is the highest attainment. He has the divine nature and the human nature, and He has such a complete accomplishment and high attainment. He is the compounded Christ. He is the all-inclusive Christ, yet today He is within us as the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Do not consider that the Holy Spirit is someone other than Christ. Christ is the Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. The last Adam is Christ, and the life-giving Spirit, no doubt, is the Holy Spirit. So Christ became the Spirit. Also, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit. This is our quotation from the Bible, not our interpretation. The Lord Christ is the very Holy Spirit who dwells within us.</P><P>Furthermore, the Bible is the breath of God, and the breath of God is the Spirit. The Lord Jesus told us that the words He speaks to us are spirit and life (John 6:63). The holy Word says that all Scripture is God-breathed (2 Tim. 3:16). Every word of this holy book is the breath of God, the Spirit. So we have Christ within us as the Spirit, and we have the Bible in our hand as the Spirit. The way to enjoy Christ as the Spirit is to call upon Him and to pray-read His word.</P><P>When you live a life of calling on the Lord, all the barriers will be broken down. Then there will be a thorough passage for Christ to get in and to get out of you. If you open the window, the air without gets in and the air within gets out. When you call, "O Lord Jesus," the window of your being is opened, and the air gets in and gets out. This is the way to enjoy Christ. The way to touch the Word is to pray-read. You need the calling, the praying, and the reading. You have to mingle your reading with praying and calling on the name of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ENJOYING THE OUTPOURED SPIRIT<br>BY CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</H2><P>Now we need to consider Acts 2:17-21, which is a quotation from the book of Joel. This portion of the Word begins by saying that God will pour out of His Spirit upon all flesh (v. 17). Then it ends by saying, "And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved" (v. 21). If you put the beginning and the end of this quotation together, you see something marvelous. This means that God pours out of His Spirit and that we have to call upon the Lord to get this Spirit. God has poured out already. Now what shall we do? Shall we ask Him to give us the outpouring of the Holy Spirit by fasting, by not sleeping, or by weeping with tears? This is the wrong way. God has poured out. Now what we need to do is to call upon the name of the Lord. Then we get the Spirit.</P><P>If I present a glass of water to someone, all he has to do is take it and drink. In the same way, we do not need to ask God for the Spirit, because He has already been poured out. God has presented the Spirit to us already. He has poured out of His Spirit upon all flesh. Now all we need to do is to call on the Lord's name.</P><P>The Bible says that God has poured out of His Spirit, not upon all spiritual or religious persons, but upon all flesh. We all are flesh, and the Spirit has been poured out upon us. The drink has been presented to us, so we do not need to beg for it. We just need to take and drink by calling on the name of the Lord. The presentation of the drink is in verse 17; the way to drink is in verse 21. God says, "I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh." Then He says, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved." We simply need to call, "O Lord Jesus." Calling on the Lord in a simple way will water you and even flood you with the Spirit. This is the way to take in the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DRINKING THE SPIRIT BY CALLING<br>ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</H2><P>First Corinthians 12:13 says that we have all been given to drink one Spirit. This means that we have been positioned to drink and we are in a position to drink. God has accomplished everything, but God can never drink for us. Regardless of how much God loves you, you still have to drink. The way to drink is in verse 3. This verse says that when you say, "Lord Jesus," you are in the Holy Spirit. In other words, when you say, "Lord Jesus," you are drinking. To be in the Holy Spirit means you are drinking of the Spirit.</P><P>You may feel you are so sinful, but your sinfulness has been taken care of on the cross. We were kept away by our sins, but our sins have been taken away (John 1:29). Then we were brought back to God and have been positioned and made to drink. You may say that you are so weak, but this is why you need to drink. There is no excuse or reason for being kept away from drinking the Spirit. Whatever sin you have committed cannot be bigger than the redemption accomplished on the cross. The redemption accomplished by Him on the cross is big enough to cover all your failures. You have to realize you were positioned to drink. Forget about your failures, your sins, and your weaknesses. The redeeming blood, the prevailing blood of Christ, has taken care of all things. This is why we are told that we have been given, or made, to drink. Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, slaves or free, we all have been made to drink. Now that we have been positioned to drink, we should drink simply by calling, "Lord Jesus," again and again. Call on the Lord for fifteen minutes, and see what will happen.</P><P>Some of the older saints may say, "All of this is good for the young people, but not for me." But breathing is the same for all ages. The young ones need the breathing; the old ones also need the breathing. As an older one, you may need more breathing. Do not consider that because you are old, you are qualified to graduate from breathing. There is no graduation from breathing. Calling on the Lord makes you younger. By calling on the Lord, you enjoy the Lord as your new strength and you mount up with wings like eagles (Isa. 40:31).</P><P>Many people have been Christians for years, and it is easy for them to read and consider the Bible. But if you ask them to pray or call on the Lord, you put them on the cross. When a newborn babe is delivered, sometimes the doctor has to spank him to get him to breathe. Sometimes we need to be "spanked" so that we will call on the name of the Lord. One brother did not want to call on the Lord. But one day he was involved in a car accident. That was a real spanking. Right away he began to call, "O Lord Jesus." If you are not breathing, the Lord will give you a "spanking"; then you will right away say, "O Lord Jesus!" Whenever we have troubles or get sick, we may call on the Lord, but afterwards we may forget. We should build up a habit of calling on the Lord all day long. Do not think that this is a small matter. We should be the calling people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CALLING PEOPLE</H2><P>When Saul was saved by the Lord on the way to Damascus, the Lord told him to go into the city and then he would be told what he must do (Acts 9:6). Then the Lord came to a disciple named Ananias and asked him to go to Saul (vv. 10-12). Ananias told the Lord that he knew that this man had authority from the chief priests to bind everyone who called on the Lord's name (v. 14). Ananias did not say that Saul had authority to bind all the Lord's disciples but all those who call on the Lord's name. This shows that in the early days calling upon the Lord's name was a sign of the Lord's followers (1 Cor. 1:2). This calling must have been audible, so that others could hear; thus it became a sign.</P><P>We are the calling people. We are not the silent believers of Christ. Day by day we call on the name of the Lord Jesus. This is our mark, our sign. In the days when Saul was trying to bind all who called on the name of the Lord, it was hard for the believers to hide themselves, because it was their habit to call. Everyone knew that they were a calling people, and this calling became a sign.</P><P>When I was staying in one locality for a conference, I stayed in the home of a brother who had two little boys. The older was about three years of age. As we were going to the meeting, I asked him where we were going. He said, "We are going to `O Lord.'" Even such a little one had the impression that the saints are the "O Lord" people. Whenever they come together, they come together to "O Lord." Acts 2 tells us that God has poured out of His Spirit upon us. What we need to do now is to call upon the name of the Lord. This is the way to take the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONTACTING THE WORD BY CALLING<br>ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</H2><P>Romans 10 tells us that this is also the way to contact the Word. It says that we do not need to ascend to the heavens to bring Christ down or to descend to the abyss to bring Christ up from the dead. This is because the word, the living word, is near us, in our mouth and in our heart, just like the air, the breath, that can be taken into our being (vv. 6-8). The air, the breath, is always in our mouth. The living word is like the air which is in our mouth. Now we just need to exercise our mouth to confess, "Lord Jesus" (v. 9). The way to take in the Spirit is to call on the Lord, and the way to take in the Word is to call on the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD BEING RICH TO ALL<br>WHO CALL UPON HIM</H2><P>Romans 10 also says that the Lord is "rich to all who call upon Him" (v. 12). It does not say that the Lord is rich to all who believe on Him, but to all who call on Him. We need the calling. In your home you need the calling. In your kitchen you need the calling. In your office you need the calling. On the street you need the calling. When you are weak, you need the calling. You can say, "O Lord Jesus, I am weak. O Lord Jesus." If you call in this way, you will become stronger. If you are going to lose your temper, do not try to restrain it. Just call on the name of the Lord: "O Lord Jesus." This calling on the name of the Lord Jesus will be a kind of power, a kind of authority, and this will chase away all the darkness. In any kind of situation, whether it is one of darkness or weakness, just call on the name of the Lord. By calling, "O Lord Jesus," you will enjoy the riches of Christ. The Lord is rich to all who call on Him. Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved (v. 13). Now is the age for us to recover the practice of calling on the name of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CALLED BY GOD TO CALL<br>UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS</H2><P>First Corinthians 1:2 says that we are the called saints who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place. We have been called to be the calling people. On the one hand, we have been called. On the other hand, we have to be calling. We are the called people to be the calling people. We should not merely believe on Him or pray to Him; we must call on Him. God called us into the fellowship of Christ (v. 9). To us, the called ones, Christ is power and wisdom (v. 24), but how can we enjoy Christ as power and wisdom? It is by calling on His name. We have been called to enjoy Christ (v. 9). If we want to enjoy Christ, we have to call on Him. We have to be the calling people who call on the Lord all day long.</P><P>In some situations you may have the feeling that you are in darkness. The best way to chase away the darkness is to call on the name of the Lord. You have to say, "O Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus!" Sometimes you may feel depressed in every way. If you call on the name of the Lord, you will be released. This is not a doctrine but something for our experience. If you do not take this and put it into practice, this fellowship will not mean anything to you. But if you put this into practice, you will see that this is the way to breathe in the Lord. To call on the name of the Lord is to breathe Him, and this includes drinking and eating Him. The drinking and eating are included in the breathing, and breathing is by calling on the name of the Lord.</P><P>Christ is everything to us, and He has accomplished everything. He was incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and He has ascended to the third heaven. He has been glorified and enthroned to reach the highest attainment. Now He is the Spirit within us and the Word outside of us. The Spirit within is the pneuma, the breath, and the Word without is also the breath of God. In order to take Him in, we need to breathe. The best way, even the unique way, the only way, to breathe Him is to call on His name. Just open up yourself all the time and call on His name. This is the breathing. Then learn how to mingle prayer and the reading of the Word with your breathing, your calling. You will have the deep sense that whenever you call on the name of the Lord by praying and reading the Word, you are breathing the Lord. In this breathing, you have the drinking and eating. All day long you will participate in Him and enjoy Him. Christ will be taken into you to become a part of you. You will then be in the rich enjoyment of Christ as life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BEING SAVED AND RENEWED<br>BY CHRIST AS LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10; 6:4; Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:22-24, 15-16; 2:21; Col. 2:19; 1 Pet. 2:2, 5</H1><P>Thus far, we have seen the way to take life in and how life grows and transforms us. In this chapter we want to see something more about life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SAVED IN HIS LIFE</H2><P>Romans 5:10 says, "Much more we will be saved in His life." Life grows, life transforms, and life saves. We all have to pay our full attention to Romans 5:10. It says that when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God. To be reconciled to God is good, but we still need something more, much more. Much more we will be saved in His life. Once we were enemies to God and were absolutely fallen. In one sense, even today while we are here on this earth and in this flesh, we are still in a fallen condition, a fallen situation, and a fallen nature. So we need to be saved.</P><P>We need to spend time in the presence of the Lord to pray, "O Lord Jesus, show me the items from which I need to be saved." You may say that you need to be saved from self, Satan, and the power of sin. But if you ask the Lord, He will show you hundreds of items from which you need to be saved.</P><P>One thing from which we need to be saved is our looseness. This looseness comes not from God's original creation but from our fall. To be loose proves that we are fallen. An example of our looseness is that we are not accurate when we report something. We may say that there were about one thousand people present in one of our meetings, but our report is exaggerated. We need to be saved from our looseness and from many other things.</P><P>We have been saved from eternal perdition and from God's condemnation, but we are fallen people, and all of the things related to us are in a fallen condition. The way we talk is fallen, the way we express ourselves is fallen, our attitude is fallen, and our talk is fallen. Even the way we walk is fallen. The way we dress and cut our hair is fallen. The way we laugh and shout is fallen. The way we look at people is fallen. Whatever we do, whatever we are, whatever we have, whatever we say, and however we behave are altogether fallen. Our conduct is absolutely a fallen matter. Since it is fallen, we need salvation; we need deliverance.</P><P>We need to be delivered from the way we talk to people, from the way we laugh, and from the way we express ourselves. We need to be delivered from the way we dress. Now that we have been reconciled, much more we will be saved in His life. In the fallen situation, Satan is subtle with certain persons in one aspect and with other persons in another aspect. Some people are wild. Wildness is a proof of the fall. We are wild because we are fallen, so we need to be saved from being wild. But this does not mean that we should be refined. To be refined is a matter of culture. Some people may be refined without, but within they are like wild beasts. We all need to be saved by His life. When we call on the Lord by saying, "Lord Jesus," we take Him in as life, and this life saves us from being wild or from our natural refinement.</P><P>Another manifestation of our fallen situation is our politeness, in the sense of being a kind of politics. That is actually falsehood. You may say that to be polite is to be nice. But you need to be saved from being so nice. The wild people need to be saved from being wild. The nice people need to be saved from being nice. Then we may wonder whether we should be wild or nice. But whether we are wild or nice, we are still fallen. We need to be saved from everything of the fall. We need to be saved from our being nice or wild. We are saved not by teaching, but by Christ as life.</P><P>Some people are naturally emotional. Generally speaking, the northern people from the cold region are rather conservative. When they are happy, they are happy within. It is really hard for us to know that they are happy. They are hiddenly and conservatively happy. But the southerners from the tropical zone are more emotional and easily excited. Maybe they are not that happy, yet they express themselves as being very happy. The northerners need to be saved from their being conservative and the southerners need to be saved from their being excited. They both need to be saved in Christ's life. Christ is not so conservative or so excited. The southerners need to be cooled down a little bit by Christ being life to them. When the Lord fed the five thousand with five loaves and two fish, He was very calm. He did not jump up and say, "Hallelujah!" The disciples may have been excited, but the Lord Jesus was calm and told them to pick up all the fragments and put them into baskets (Matt. 14:14-21).</P><P>Christ as life to us saves us from what we are. If you are slow, Christ will save you from your slowness. If you are quick, Christ will be your life to save you from your quickness. We had a co-worker among us whom I met in 1934. Brother Watchman Nee told me concerning this brother that if you tell him to go east, he will go west. If you said yes, he would say no. So it was very easy for you to get along with him. If you wanted him to go east, you just needed to ask him to go west. Then he would go east. Many times when we say no, the Lord says yes. When we say yes, the Lord says no.</P><P>If you are a slow person, the Lord will ask you to hurry. If you are a quick person, the Lord will tell you to be patient. This is according to Christ as life, not the law. We all need to be saved from what we are. If you like to laugh, the Lord says, "Don't laugh." If you like to be quiet, the Lord says, "Be excited." The Lord will say to the northern Canadians, "Be excited," and to the southern Mexicans, "Be quiet."</P><P>We are fallen people. Whatever we are is in a fallen condition. Do not keep anything of what you are naturally. We need to be saved from our natural condition, from what we are naturally. Some may ask whether it is right to be quiet or to be excited. Our answer is that neither is right or wrong. If the Lord saves you to be excited, you have to be excited. If the Lord saves you to be calm, you have to be calm. It is up to Him. There is no legality. But I do know that the Lord's salvation, the Lord's deliverance, is always against our nature.</P><P>If you never like to talk, the Lord will say, "Talk." He will urge you to call more on His name, to praise Him more, and to speak for Him more. If you are talkative, the Lord will say, "Be quiet." The Lord would not allow you to talk. He would save you from being talkative. This is the Lord's salvation. I like to see the Canadians shouting praises, but I do not like to see the Mexicans shouting so much. We need to be saved in His life. By our life we live in a natural way, but by His life we live in a way which is absolutely versus our nature. I encourage you to go to the Lord and see what He would say to you. We need to go along with Christ as life within us. When the Canadians are excited, they will have the growth of life, but when the Mexicans shout too much, they will not gain the increase of life. We all need to be saved, not by outward doing, but by the inward life, by Christ as life. Christ is going to live within us another life versus our natural life.</P><P>Now you may wonder what you should do. You should simply go along with the inner life. Life saves. You need to be saved from every item of your natural being. If you are faithful and mean business with the Lord, the more you say, "O Lord" to take in the Lord, the more you will be saved from what you are. You will be saved from your being and from your behavior. Then you will know how to behave yourself, not according to your life, but according to Christ as your life within you.</P><P>We will eventually be saved to such an extent that we will become the highest people in life. As those who are for the Lord's testimony, for the Lord's recovery, and for the local church, we need the highest manner of life in our offices, our schools, and our neighborhoods. We need the highest behavior, not by our own doing, but by Christ as life. We will convince people not just by our shouting, our praising, our singing, or our calling, but by having our being on the highest plane.</P><P>You have to convince people not just by what you say or by what you claim to be, but by your being, by your saved behavior. Your being on the highest plane will cause people to look up to you. You will be on the highest plane because you are being saved by Christ being your life. You are living by Christ, the highest life. If we are like this, the Lord has a way to move on, and nothing can prevail against the Lord's way. So we look to the Lord for His saving by His life. We all need to declare: "Much more we will be saved in His life!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RENEWED BY LIFE</H2><P>The divine life, the highest life, the eternal life, the everlasting life, never gets old. If anything can become old, that is not the real life. Our human life is becoming old, so this is not a real life. The real life is always new; it is everlastingly new, ever fresh.</P><P>Romans 5:10 says we will be saved in His life. Then Romans 6:4 says that we should walk in newness of life. Life renews. We should tell the Lord, "O Lord, every day You are new." If we are faithful to the Lord and honest in saying this, we will never be the same as we were yesterday. Every day we will be renewed. We will have the new experience of Christ every day. I would say a word to the elderly brothers and sisters among us. No doubt, physically speaking we are old; we may be at least one generation older than the younger ones. But Psalm 103:5 says that God can satisfy us so that we may have our youth renewed like the eagle's. Our youth can come back by taking Christ as life into us. We have to drop our oldness and say, "Praise the Lord! We have Christ within, so our youth has to come back." It is possible for us to have our youth renewed like the eagle's by taking in Christ all day as our life. The Lord may tell the elderly saints to be more excited and the younger saints among us to be less excited.</P><P>We all need to be renewed day by day. Yesterday's manna should not be today's food. Every day we have the new manna (Exo. 16:14-22). By this renewing we will be delivered from our old manner of life, and we will be renewed into the new manner of life (Eph. 4:22-24). This is the church life. To put on the new man includes the putting on of the church life. We need to be renewed again and again.</P><P>Some of the brothers, according to their nature by birth, like to be alone. They like to stay home in their own room. This kind of disposition is not good for the church life. We all need to be renewed day by day from the old manner of life into a new manner of life. This new manner of life is the church life. Some are not used to talking to others. But in the church life you need to talk with others and be mingled with others. Otherwise, how can we be one Body?</P><P>On the other hand, there are some who are so open according to their natural disposition. These brothers are used to being one with others, not in the spirit, but in the natural life. One young brother may even be so open that he would exchange his shoes with another brother. Some would say that these two brothers love one another, but eventually these brothers will fight one another. Their relationship is not spiritual for the church life, but something in the natural life. We need to be renewed in every aspect of our daily life. If you are closed, the Lord will say, "Be open." If you are so open, the Lord will say, "Be careful. Don't be so open." If you like to contact people by your nature, the Lord will say, "Restrain yourself a little bit." If you don't like to contact people by your nature, the Lord will say, "Go out."</P><P>We need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind (Eph. 4:23). If we call on the Lord day by day, we will be renewed little by little. Eventually, we will have the Body life, the church life, absolutely not in a natural way. We will have a lot of contact, fellowship, and mingling in a very spiritual way. Natural relationships do not last. Enemies are made between people who were once friends. If you are fellowshipping with the brothers and sisters in a natural way, be prepared for discord. Today you may love a certain person, but later you may dislike him. We all need to be renewed by calling on the name of the Lord. By continually calling, "O Lord Jesus," we will be renewed in the spirit of our mind.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GROWING UP INTO CHRIST IN ALL THINGS</H1><P>Ephesians 4:15 says that we have to grow up into Christ in all things. I would ask you to consider this. In how many things have you grown up into Christ? I believe it is necessary for us to go to the Lord and stay in His presence to write a list of all the items of our daily walk. Write down all the items of what you are, of what you do, of what you think, of what you have, and of what you use. It may be that you would write down more than a few hundred items to be considered in the light of the Lord's presence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GROWING UP INTO CHRIST<br>IN OUR MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL</H2><P>Have you grown up into Christ in your thinking? You have Christ within you, in your spirit, but your mind may still be far away from the indwelling Christ. Your mind may be separated from the spirit. You have Christ within your spirit, but your mind has nothing to do with Christ. This simply means that you have not grown up into Christ in your mind. Your thinking is still not in Christ.</P><P>I do not mean that you are wrong in your thinking. You might be absolutely right, but you are not in Christ. Right and wrong are both of the same category; they are both of the tree of knowledge. With us, the seeking ones, it is not a matter of being right. It must be a matter of being in Christ. With us, to be in Christ is right. We need to grow. Bring this matter to the Lord and see how much you need to grow into Christ in your mind.</P><P>Now consider your emotion, another part of your soul. You have Christ in your spirit, but your emotion is still insulated from Christ. I want to say a word to the young people. On the one hand, we say that we do not want to be bound; we want to be liberated. This is absolutely right, but on the other hand, you have to check&#151;is Christ in your emotion, or do you just have your emotion liberated? Some may think that they are in the local church where they are absolutely liberated and can do everything that they like. In a sense, there is no restriction in the local church, but there is Christ. Can you say that when you are so excited, Christ is within your emotion to be excited together with you? You need to grow up into Christ in your emotion.</P><P>In our meetings we surely need to be released in our praising and singing, but we have to be sure that when we sing the hymns, Christ is singing within our singing. We have to be sure that when we are so released, Christ is released. The young people may be excited, but they have to be sure that they have Christ in their emotion. If you do not have Christ in your emotion and are shouting, that is looseness.</P><P>In order to be spiritual we need to be emotional, but we need to be spiritually emotional. This means to be emotional with Christ. You must have the assurance that Christ is in your emotion and that your emotion is not insulated from Christ, but connected and mingled with Christ. The church life is a life of the saints mingled with Christ. Anything we do must be with Christ mingling with us. If we do not have the assurance that Christ is doing something with us, we have to be a little careful. We should go to the Lord and ask Him, "Lord, in this matter, are You in my emotion?"</P><P>Not only in the meetings but also in our daily life we should not be dumb believers. We have to be the ones who call on the name of the Lord in every place (1 Cor. 1:2). But in our calling there must be Christ calling. We must have the assurance that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, He is calling within our calling. Otherwise, we will have too much looseness. That is not something of the Spirit nor is it the release of the Spirit. That is the release of something else. That is wrong and will give people a bad impression. So we have to be balanced and fair. Surely we should not be bound. This is why we do not like to restrict anyone. Yet we need to be balanced. We need to be in the spirit with the assurance that we have Christ in the things we do. Of course, this needs the growth. We need to grow into Christ in our emotion.</P><P>Now we need to consider our will, another part of our soul. We need to grow into Christ in the will. That means our will has to be saturated with Christ. We have to grow into Christ in making any kind of decision. When we make a decision, we should not make it by ourselves. We have to open ourselves in our will to Christ and let Christ come into our will to take full possession of our will. Then we will make a decision by using our will with Christ. We will have the assurance to say that Christ is one with us in our will. The mind, emotion, and will are big items. Now let us consider some small items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GROWING UP INTO CHRIST<br>IN THE DETAILS OF OUR DAILY LIFE</H2><P>When the brothers buy a necktie, it seems that this is a small thing, but the principle in buying it is not small. You have to grow up into Christ in the matter of buying a tie. I am happy to see the young people seeking and loving the Lord so much. But as you are seeking the Lord so much, you need to grow up into Christ when you go to the department store to buy a tie. When you buy a tie, you must have the assurance that you are in Christ. If you are not sure, that means your shopping is not in Christ. With us it is not a matter of right or wrong; it is a matter of being in Christ or apart from Christ. You have to be able to tell Satan, "Satan, look, my shopping is in Christ!" Could you say this? You can cheat me, but you cannot cheat the devil, because he knows.</P><P>We also need to consider how we cut and style our hair. Brothers, how about your haircut? When you go to get a haircut, this is not a small matter, because you practice a principle of growing into Christ in all things. This includes your haircut. Have you grown into Christ in the way that you cut your hair? Do not argue with me. Simply go to Christ and check with Him. You may want to know what kind of haircut is right. I would say, "I don't know. I am not Christ. He knows." I believe that if you go along with Him and go to Him and say, "O Lord, my haircut," you will know what to do. He knows and you know too. Others do not know. But after you cut it, those who are spiritual know whether or not the cutting of your hair is of the flesh or of Christ. They know whether you have grown up into Christ in the matter of cutting your hair.</P><P>We need to bring all the items of our daily walk to the Lord, and say, "O Lord," over every item. Do not just say, "O Lord," in a general way, but in a specific way, in an itemized way. Item by item you have to say, "O Lord," and seek His leading. Then you will have the growth in life. This kind of practice will revolutionize you.</P><P>The older brothers and sisters may feel that the young people are too much and need to be balanced. But we should not think that our oldness is something of Christ either. We have to grow up into Christ in our oldness. We have to give up our oldness. We need a change. My point is that we have to grow up into Christ in everything.</P><P>The sisters should not just call on the Lord in a general way. You have to call on the Lord in everything in your daily walk. You need to go to the Lord with every item of your daily walk and have a thorough dealing with the Lord. Then you will see the change, not by teaching, correction, or outward adjustment, but by the growth in life into Christ in all things. You need to call on the Lord when you buy your eyeglasses. Then the Lord will adjust you inwardly.</P><P>If we do not do this, we are not faithful to the Lord. When we use the name of the Lord, we must mean it. Second Timothy 2:22 says that we need to pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Verse 19 says, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness." All those who name the name of the Lord must depart from any kind of iniquity. When we say, "O Lord," we have to mean business with the Lord. We do not call on the Lord in a light or loose way. We mean it. If we call on the Lord and yet do not deal with the items of our daily walk, I am afraid that we are being loose with the name of the Lord. This is not good. We have to mean business with the Lord. If we mean business with the Lord by saying, "O Lord," I believe the Lord will point out specific things to us in our daily walk which need to be dealt with. We need to bring every item of our daily walk into the presence of the Lord. In every item we need to pray, "Lord, how about this?" No one can tell us specifically except the Lord Himself.</P><P>The Bible tells us that the sisters should dress in a modest way (1 Tim. 2:9; 1 Pet. 3:3), but only the Lord knows how modest is modest. When you say, "O Lord," the Lord knows and you know. In 1943 a young lady who was very worldly began to come to our meetings. After she came to a few meetings, the Lord touched her. The first time she came to the meeting, her hair was like a "high tower," arranged high upon her head. One day she came to our meeting, and this tower was gone. Meeting by meeting we could see that something changed with her. That really means that she got rid of a number of things. Eventually, she became a simple young lady. No one told her anything. She experienced the transformation in life. The power of the divine life changed her.</P><P>One brother used to smoke before he was saved by the Lord. After he came to our meetings and was saved, he lost his taste for smoking by being transformed from within. He was absolutely changed and kept away from the old things of his old manner of life. In our meetings we do not give messages telling people to give up their sinful and bad habits. But Christ is the transforming life within the believers. If we mean business with the Lord by saying, "O Lord," there will surely be a change in life. This change in life is not something outward, but something from within. Christ is very careful. He is never careless. The more you go along with Him, the more you contact Him, the more you say, "O Lord," the more you will be restricted by Christ. Christ will restrict us in everything. This restriction is transformation.</P><P>The issue of life is growth and transformation. Life grows; life also transforms. We do not trust in teaching, but we have full trust in the Lord's life. The more you say, "O Lord," the more you will be transformed from within. This transformation might seem slow, but it is steadfast, bit by bit, and day by day. The more you take in Christ, the more you will be transformed. He is not a doctrine. He is powerfully living. As you take Him in, He will transform you in your attitude, your emotion, your motive, your desire, your aim, and your behavior in many ways. Everything will be touched by Him.</P><P>Life grows and life transforms. C. H. Spurgeon was a great preacher in England during the last century, yet at one time he still smoked. A brother of the Brethren assembly was bothered by this and went to see C. H. Spurgeon. Spurgeon was trying to argue by saying, "I smoke for the glory of God." This Brethren brother then put up a big signboard across the street which said, "C. H. Spurgeon says he smokes for the glory of God." That forced Spurgeon to give up smoking. Spurgeon lost his argument in the matter of smoking. Many times we try to argue with the Lord by saying that we have the peace to do something, but eventually we lose our case. If you will not lose the case with the Lord in this age, I am sure that in the coming age, you will lose it. I say again that this is not something legal. We have no legality, but we have the grace within. His grace is sufficient. Just say, "O Lord" from a sincere heart and mean business with the Lord. Then He will come in to take away the evil things and all the things that are not of Him.</P><P>Anything that is not a profit to us mentally, physically, or spiritually is a waste, and that is something condemned by the Lord. When you say, "O Lord Jesus," be honest and mean business with Him. You will see what will happen to you. I hope that you would go to the Lord and put this fellowship into practice. Call on the Lord over every item in your daily life, and see what the Lord will say to you. Then you will see not only the growth in life but also the transformation in life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE GROWTH IN LIFE<br>FOR GOD'S BUILDING</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:6, 9-12; 1 Pet. 2:2, 5; Eph. 4:11-16; 2:20-22</H1><P>Life grows, transforms, saves, and renews for God's building. Thus, life builds up the church of God. The verses in the Scripture reading show that the growth of life is for the building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FIRST CORINTHIANS&#151;A BOOK TO THE LOCAL CHURCH</H2><P>First Corinthians was not written to individual believers or to the so-called church in the heavens. Paul said in 1:2 that this book was written to the church of God which was at Corinth, to the church in a locality, a local church. Thus, if we want to understand, to know, to realize, and to apprehend this book, we have to be in the local church. This is a book to the local church. Thank the Lord that we are in the local church, and we are positioned to receive this book. If we are in the right position, it is easy for us to see certain things. Because we are in the local church, it is easy for us to see a book written to the local church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PLANTING AND WATERING ON GOD'S FARM<br>FOR THE GROWTH IN LIFE TO PRODUCE<br>PRECIOUS MATERIAL BY THE TRANSFORMATION<br>IN LIFE FOR GOD'S BUILDING</H2><P>In this book Paul said that he planted, Apollos watered, and God made to grow (3:6). The planting, watering, and making to grow are not for individual believers. In 3:9 Paul said, "You are God's cultivated land [God's farm], God's building." The you in this verse is plural, not singular. The planting and the watering are for the farm. They are not for individuals but for the church, for the Body.</P><P>In today's Christianity nearly all the teachings are for individual believers. Christianity tries to create spiritual giants, but this is wrong. God has no intention of building up spiritual individuals. God's intention is to build up the local churches for the building up of the Body of Christ, God's farm, God's building. The planting and the watering are for the growth, and the growth is for the building. We are not only God's farm but also God's building. The farm comes first and then the building. This means the farm is for the building.</P><P>A farm is a plot of land for growing things. The church is God's land to grow Christ, not in an individual way, but in a corporate way. In the church we are the plants, planted by God to grow Christ. Something of Christ will be grown up in each of us. This is the farm of God, and the growth on this farm is for the building. It is by the growth that the material for the building is produced. To say that the church is God's farm and God's building seems very simple, but actually it is not that simple. The planting on the farm, of course, is related to the vegetable life. But eventually the growth of the plants issues in gold, silver, and precious stones (v. 12). How can the plants grow to produce gold, silver, and precious stones? The plants produce minerals.</P><P>This thought is not only in 1 Corinthians but also in Genesis 2. The tree of life is a plant. Along with the tree of life there is a river, and this is the watering. Thus, we have the planting and the watering. Then at the flow of the river there are gold, bdellium [pearl], and onyx stone, a precious stone (vv. 9-12). The thought in 1 Corinthians 3 was there already in Genesis 2. The growth of the plantation produces minerals. Actually, this is very scientific. Something of the mineral life is in the plant life. When we eat the plant life, we also receive something of the mineral life. We receive minerals such as iron, salt, sulphur, and zinc. Our physical body is built up with a number of minerals.</P><P>The church is not something that is organized or formed in an outward way. The church is a body built up with Christ, yet this Christ is of the plant life and the mineral life. If you want to know more about this, I would ask you to read The All-Inclusive Christ. In that book I point out a number of aspects of Christ which are typified by both the vegetable life and the mineral life (see chapters five through eight, pp. 46-87). Christ is the vegetable life to us to produce all the minerals. The farm of God, the plantation of God, produces the precious material, gold, silver, and precious stones.</P><P>Now in the church we, the laborers of God, are planting and watering with the expectation that God's farm will produce the precious material for His building. Christ as the vine in John 15 produces the fruit for the Father's glorification (v. 8), but if we have just the fruit, we do not have the material for the building. We cannot build a house with clusters of grapes. The plantation of God's farming is for producing gold, silver, and precious stones for His building.</P><P>Some may just want to be the fruit, which is soft and sweet, but ultimately our growth is for God's building. I have met a number of sweet saints, but there is nothing good in them for the building. Today in God's house, God needs the hard, solid material. You and I have to be so solid, not so soft and sweet. If we are so sweet, the building is gone. Today in all the places, we need some hard ones. The grapes are good for appreciation, but not good for the building. God today needs some solid material to be produced out of the growth of God's plantation. Paul planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth, not to produce fruit, but to produce gold, silver, and precious stones. The Lord has to change our concept, to turn our natural understanding to His revelation. Gold signifies God's divine nature, the nature of the Father. Silver, in typology, signifies redemption, the redeeming work of the Son. Precious stones are transformed material, signifying the transforming work of the Holy Spirit. This is the work of the Triune God to produce gold, silver, and precious stones, which are the material to build up God's house.</P><P>We all need to grow in life for the transformation in life. Some of the sisters among us are wild and bold. This is natural. Other sisters are so timid. This is also natural. We need to grow so that we will become so strong and solid in the Lord's testimony. In the church life all the timid sisters have to be strong, not in a natural way, but in a spiritual way. When the time comes for a sister to give a testimony, her testimony should be solid. At that time she should be so strong, solid, and hard, like a diamond.</P><P>The brothers should be the same. Some brothers testify in the meetings in a dying way. They are not living and exercised in the spirit. Other brothers are so naturally bold. When they shout, "Hallelujah," this is in the flesh, not in the spirit. We need the growth in life to make us solid and precious material for God's building. Life grows, life transforms, and life produces the precious material. We should not excuse ourselves by saying that we are timid by nature. There is no excuse, because the church is God's farm and we are under the planting and watering. We are now growing so that we might be transformed into precious material.</P><P>Through all of our experience, we have learned that no human being is trustworthy. This is because every human being was made of clay and is a piece of clay. When the clay is dry, it seems solid. But when water is poured upon it, it dissolves. Not one human being is a piece of solid stone. Therefore, we are not trustworthy. We cannot trust in a piece of clay, so we need the transformation.</P><P>When Simon came to the Lord, the Lord immediately changed his name to Peter, which means "a stone" (John 1:42). He would no longer be Simon, but Peter, a stone for the building up of the church. Have you ever seen a building with two columns of clay to support the building? Of course not. Any piece of clay is not trustworthy. In my early years, I had complete trust in every brother. Eventually, I learned the lesson that no human being is trustworthy. This is why we need transformation by the growth in life. The church as the house of God is built not with the pieces of clay but with pieces of stone. How strong a local church is depends upon how much transformation has been produced.</P><P>It is not just a matter of saying we love one another and of embracing one another. We need the transformation. Without transformation, we may embrace one another today, but later we may criticize and condemn one another. I am happy to see the young people seeking the Lord, but I am waiting to see something more. I want to see how much transformation can be carried out. This is the need. The church needs the solid building, not anything of mere emotional affection, but something solid in God's transformation with all the fullness of the Godhead. The nature of the Father has to be built into us, the redeeming work of the Son has to be wrought into our nature, and the transforming work of the Holy Spirit has to be accomplished within our whole being. Then we become solid and trustworthy. Then God can put His trust in us because through His transformation we have become the material for the building up of the church.</P><P>This is why I have always said that you can never build up a local church by your teaching, by your doctrine. The local church can be built up only by the transforming life. What we need is to minister life to people, and this life will carry out the transforming work. Then this transforming work will produce the real, solid, precious material for the building up of the church.</P><P>I am happy and thankful to the Lord that within these past years, I have seen the growth of many saints. In this growth I have also seen the transforming work of the Holy Spirit. When the saints in a local church have experienced a good measure of transformation, that church becomes very solid and can stand against any kind of storm. Nothing of our human nature, nothing natural, is good for the building up of the church. The building material must be of the Father's nature, of the Son's redeeming work, and of the Spirit's transforming work. We all need to be renewed and transformed. The Lord is moving on to do the building work among us.</P><P>In 1 Corinthians 3 there are the planting and the watering for the growth, and the growth is for the producing of precious material for the building. So on the one hand, we are the farm, and on the other hand, we are the building. The farm is for the growth, and the growth is for the building. Thus, the farm is for the building. The church is a farm to grow Christ so that precious material might be produced for God's building. For this building, we need the growth of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DRINKING THE GUILELESS MILK OF THE WORD<br>THAT WE MAY GROW AND BE TRANSFORMED<br>INTO LIVING STONES FOR GOD'S BUILDING</H2><P>First Peter 2:2 says that as newborn babes we should long for the guileless milk of the word (not the knowledge of the word but the nourishing element, the milk, of the word) that by it we may grow. Verse 5 says that we are living stones. These stones come out of the growth, and the growth comes out of the pure milk of the word. The more we drink the milk of the word, the more we grow, and the more we grow, the more we become the living stones, which are for the building up of the spiritual house. Again, the growth of life is for the building of God's house. Life builds.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GIFTED PERSONS PERFECTING THE SAINTS<br>BY NOURISHING THEM THAT THEY MAY BE<br>A FULL-GROWN MAN</H2><P>Ephesians 4 says that the Head of the church, Christ, gave the gifted persons&#151;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. All these gifted persons were given by the Head to His Body, not for a direct building of the Body, but for the perfecting of the saints (vv. 11-12). The gifted persons are not the direct builders, but they are the perfecters to perfect the saints. They perfect the saints, not by teaching them, but by nourishing them that they may be a full-grown man. To be a full-grown man, we need the nourishment that we may grow. Any teaching that nourishes us is good. Any teaching that just teaches us is not good. The teaching must be a nourishing teaching, something that ministers the nourishment of life to us so that by it we may grow.</P><P>Ephesians 4 also tells us that we need to be perfected to arrive at a full-grown man so that "we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men" (v. 14). This is to be carried away from Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, by some kind of distracting teaching. Many Christians today are like little children tossed to and fro and carried away by the wind of doctrine. We want to be those who are being inwardly nourished for the growth in life in the local churches for the building up of the Body. No teaching should be able to shake us or carry us away. We should just care for the spiritual nourishment that we may grow into a full-grown man.</P><P>Then we hold the reality in love and grow up into Christ in all things (v. 15). By this the Body is built up directly, not by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, but by all the functioning members. According to 4:16 the Body builds itself up in love by the members themselves. The members are the direct builders of the Body. The practical building of the local churches must be by the local members, who are the direct builders of the local church. The gifted persons are the perfecters of the members. They help the members grow. They are for the perfecting of the saints until all the saints are full-grown. Then every member will function, that is, every joint will supply and every part will operate according to its measure. In this way the Body builds itself up in love.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GROWING INTO A HOLY TEMPLE IN THE LORD</H2><P>Ephesians 2 says that we are no longer strangers and sojourners, but members of the household of God (v. 19). The members of the household need to be built together upon the foundation, Christ. Verse 21 says that in Christ "all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord." The building up of God's temple is by the growth of the Body. Again, the growth is for the building, and the building depends upon the growth.</P><P>Verse 22 says, "In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit." In verse 21 the holy temple is universal. In verse 22 the dwelling place of God is local. Life grows, and this growth is for the building of the house of God. Thus, life builds. The more we call on the Lord by saying, "O Lord," the more we take Him in as our life, and this life works within us to build up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BUILDING THROUGH THE WORKING<br>OF THE TRANSFORMING SPIRIT</H2><P>We may be very good people, but if we do not allow the life within us to grow and transform us, we cannot be the material for the building. Our being good is leaven. If I love you in a natural way, this kind of love is leaven that corrupts and ruins the Body. If two brothers have a close friendship in their natural life, this is not the building up. This is the leaven that corrupts, that damages the fine flour (Matt. 13:33). So we have to condemn this. We have to put this on the cross; we have to bury and get rid of this.</P><P>We need transformation. The more that life grows within us, the more we realize that natural affection and natural goodness have to be put on the cross and buried. Whatever is of the natural man can never build up the Body. We may have fellowship in the spirit, but we should not have friendship in the emotion. Friendship in the emotion is leaven that corrupts the Body life. Until we hate everything of our natural being, we cannot be built up together. The real building, the solid building, is in the spirit through the working of the transforming Spirit.</P><P>I believe that we have seen the way for the building up of the local church. The leading brothers, who by God's mercy and grace are laboring among the saints for the building up of the local churches, have to realize that the local churches can never be built up by mere teaching. What we need to do is minister life to the saints so that the saints may be perfected by being nourished. They need to be perfected in feeding on Christ to be nourished by Christ. Then they will grow, and this growth will produce gold, silver, and precious stones for the building of God's house. May the Lord be merciful and gracious to us that we who are in the Lord's present recovery may know the way of life. It is by this way that there is the possibility for the building up of the local churches. Life builds.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE<br>FOR THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 2:14; 1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; 11:16; 14:33; Rev. 2:7a, 11a, 17a; 2 Pet. 1:1, 3-5; Eph. 5:18-22; Col. 3:16-18</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CORPORATE BUILDING</H2><P>Life builds, and this building is not just a local matter, because a local church is a part of the Lord's Body. The Body of Christ is universal, including all the local churches. So if we are continually in the process of growing, we will be built together in our locality, and all the local churches will be built together as one. This does not mean that all the local churches have to be organized into one. Although the churches are local in their administration, they are all the parts of the Body of Christ, and every local church is a local expression of the Body of Christ. Thus, in principle, all the local churches must be the same. All the local churches must follow one another (1 Thes. 2:14).</P><P>The apostle did not have different teachings toward different local churches. He taught the same thing everywhere in every church, and he commanded the same thing in all the churches (1 Cor. 4:17; 11:16; 14:33). In Revelation 2 and 3 there are seven epistles from the Lord to the seven local churches respectively, yet the end of each epistle says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). Each epistle is written to one definite local church, but that particular epistle is also for all the churches. This implies that all the churches, as the Lord's testimony in the Spirit, should be the same.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW LIFE WORKS IN US</H2><P>Now we want to see how life works in us to grow, transform, renew, save, and build. We need to see the concept of God in His divine economy. Our natural concept is always different from God's concept. We consider either that God does everything for us or that we do everything, but God's way is higher than ours.</P><P>Second Peter 1 gives us a clear picture of how God's life works. First, God has given us all things pertaining to life within and godliness without (v. 3). But on the other hand, verse 5 says that we have to use diligence to develop what God has given: "And for this very reason also, adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith virtue; and in virtue, knowledge." The word adding means to develop.</P><P>Faith is like a seed, and this seed needs to be developed. God created the seed and has given us the seed. Now on our part we have to be diligent. We have to use our diligence to sow the seed. To sow the seed is to have the seed developed. After sowing the seed, we have to water it. Then the seed will grow. Out of the seed, the roots develop. Out of the roots, the stump develops, and then the branches, the leaves, the blossoms, and the fruit develop. This is a step by step development of life.</P><P>Neither God nor we do everything. On the one hand, God has created the seed and has given us the seed. On the other hand, we have to sow the seed, water it, and take care of it. Then it grows step by step until we have the fruit and the harvest. This is the way that life works. This is a life principle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD HAVING GIVEN US FAITH, THE DIVINE SEED, AND THE PRECIOUS AND EXCEEDINGLY GREAT PROMISES</H2><P>Second Peter 1 tells us that God has given us three categories of things. First, God has given us Christ as faith. Peter said that we have received equally precious faith (v. 1). In this equally precious faith, Peter and we are exactly the same. Even if we are not able to define what faith is, we still have it. There are many precious things which we cannot explain. We have our physical life, but what is it? No one can define it, not even the medical doctors. Life is just life. In the same way, we have something within us called faith. We cannot explain it, but we have it. We cannot give it up or forget it. After believing into Christ, some may want to give up being a Christian, but they cannot do it. It is too late. Something came into them which they cannot give up. Once it gets in, it never leaves. We have been caught by the Lord, and He has come into us as our faith. We have all received equally precious faith.</P><P>Second, God has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness (v. 3). Godliness includes the church life. First Timothy 3 reveals that the great mystery of godliness is the church life (vv. 15-16). Godliness is the expression of life. We have all things pertaining to life within and to the expression of life without.</P><P>God has given us all these things and we have received them, but how can we prove this? Let us use the seed of a certain plant as an illustration. All the things related to what this seed will be are included in the seed. If you have given me the seed, you have given me the root, the stump, the branches, the leaves, the blossoms, and the fruit. Since I have received the seed, I have received all these things. Everything pertaining to life and the expression of life are included in the seed.</P><P>Second Peter 1 says that God's divine power has given us all things. This divine power is nothing less than God Himself. At the very moment we opened up our mouth to say, "O Lord Jesus," He came into us. We may say that the Triune God came into us, but we need to realize that this One is the divine power. The divine power is nothing less than God Himself in His Divine Trinity. The Triune God as the divine power came into us, and this divine power has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness.</P><P>The Triune God is the seed within us (1 John 3:9). We need to see that the very Triune God who is the divine power, the seed of all the things pertaining to life and godliness, is now within us. Godliness includes the church life. If we are faithful to cooperate with this all-inclusive seed, the church life will be developed.</P><P>God has also given us the precious and exceedingly great promises (2 Pet. 1:4). The Bible is a book of promises. God has given us faith, the seed of all the things pertaining to life and godliness, and the Word, which has the promises, great and precious. We have everything we need. In these verses, the predicate is in the perfect tense: God has granted. Everything has been granted, and everything has been received. All believers, young and old, have received the same three things: faith, the seed of life, and the promises of the Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY OF COOPERATION IN ORDER<br>TO DEVELOP WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN US</H2><P>God has done everything on His part, so what shall we do? If we forget what God has given us, this is wrong. First Peter 1:5 says that along with what we have received of God, we have to add all diligence to do the developing work. God has given us the seed, the soil, the land, the sunshine, the air, and the rain. Everything is here. The Bible tells us that God has given us all things. Now we do not need to do a separate work by ourselves. We simply need to go along with what God has given, to develop what God has given. We do this by sowing the seed and watering it. Then it will be developed step after step until we have a harvest. This is the cooperation we need to render to God's doing. God has done so much. Now we need to cooperate with God.</P><P>Do not just believe that since God has done everything, He will do everything. It is wrong to think that everything must be done by God and that there is no need for us to do anything. But there is also another wrong extreme. This is the thought that we have to do everything. The right way is that on the one hand, we realize that God has given everything. On the other hand, we realize that we need to cooperate with God. We need to develop what God has given. We have the seed, and now we need to sow it and water it. We need to render the proper cooperation to God.</P><P>Let us apply this principle in a practical way. The hardest job in the whole world to the wives is for them to submit to their husbands. Surely the sisters cannot submit in themselves. Then what shall they do? They may say, "I cannot have submission, but God can. God is the God of impossibilities. I cannot, but God can!" This is good doctrine, but it does not work. God can be your submission, but He needs your cooperation.</P><P>The way of cooperation can be seen in Ephesians 5:18-22 and Colossians 3:16-18. Ephesians 5:22 says, "Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord." Colossians 3:18 says, "Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord." Please notice that these verses end with the phrases as to the Lord and in the Lord.</P><P>We also have to read Ephesians 5:22 in the context of the previous verses. They say that we need to be filled in our spirit. Then we will be filled with God and filled with singing, praising, and thanking (vv. 18-20). This shows that the submission comes out of the enjoyment of God, that is, out of the singing, praising, and thanking. Some of the wives try to submit themselves to their husbands without singing, praising, and thanking. Instead they try by the "gnashing of teeth." It is no wonder that they cannot make it. They are short of singing, praising, and thanking. If they would say, "O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah," and exercise their spirit to rejoice in the Lord, spontaneously they would submit themselves to their own husbands. The real submission comes out of being filled in spirit.</P><P>God has given all things pertaining to life and godliness, and the submission of the wives is a small part of this godliness. Godliness is the expression of the life within, and this expression includes the submission of the wives. If we practice the right way to develop the seed within, this seed will grow into submission. This submission will be sweet and spontaneous. There is no need of self-effort by the gnashing of teeth. Instead, we need to be joyful in the Lord. Then submission becomes an enjoyment, not a suffering. It becomes our resting bed, not a burden. God has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness, including submission. Now we need to cooperate with God to develop this seed by being filled. Be filled in your spirit with the Spirit! Be filled with singing, with praising, and with thanking. The issue of this will be godliness, including submission.</P><P>Now let us consider Colossians 3. Verse 18 tells the wives to be subject to their husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Verse 16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God." The Spirit within us is the divine power, and the Word outside of us is the great and precious promises. We have to be filled with the Spirit and with the Word. The Spirit is in Ephesians 5 and the Word is in Colossians 3.</P><P>We need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly by pray-reading the Word. When we pray-read the Word, it becomes the Spirit. In John 6:63 the Lord said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life." If we call on the name of the Lord and pray and read His Word, His Word will become the Spirit. Then we will be rejoicing in the Lord because we are full of Christ. Spontaneously, we will have the sweet submission.</P><P>The submission comes out of the seed that has been sown into us. The divine power has given us all the things pertaining to life and godliness. This power is the Spirit within us. We also have been given the great and precious promises in the Word outside of us. We should not keep away from the Spirit within and the Word without. We have to continually contact the Spirit within and pray-read the Word without. We do not merely study the Word as a book. We pray-read the Word by calling upon the name of the Lord. We have the Spirit within as the divine power and the holy book without as the great and precious promises. All the riches of the divine life are our portion for us to enjoy. When we enjoy these riches, we will have the expression of life, godliness, in our living. Our living will be one of godliness, the expression of God as life.</P><P>Whatever we need will be supplied to us. Submission, patience, humility, love, power, and mercy are all in the divine seed within us. The Body life, the local church life, is included in this godliness. The local church life has been given to us. Perhaps we have seen the New Testament church, so we agree to come together and practice it. But if we do this without the enjoyment of Christ, our practice will be a mess. We need to call on the name of the Lord, be filled within, and enjoy His Word. This is to render Him the adequate cooperation. Then we will enjoy the current of the heavenly electricity flooding us with the riches of life. Spontaneously, we will have the proper church life. The church life comes out of the divine seed within us. It is not something made up by us. The church life is a great item of godliness. We have the church life within already. What we need now is to develop it. The fruit is included in the seed, and the seed has been given to us. If we develop the seed, we will develop the fruit.</P><P>In Ephesians 5 there is the Spirit, and in Colossians 3 there is the Word. Eventually, the Word and the Spirit are one. By comparing these two matching portions of the Scripture, we can see that the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word. We can make the Word the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord and pray-reading. Then the Spirit will be consolidated with the Word. We need to be filled in our spirit and let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. God has given, and God has done everything. Now we need to take the initiative to be filled. If we open the window, the air will come in. We have the Spirit and the Word as the key to being filled. Now we need to exercise our spirit to be filled with the Spirit by letting the word dwell in us richly through calling on the Lord and pray-reading the Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR A FRESH CONSECRATION</H2><P>We need to consecrate ourselves anew to the Lord for the working of the inner life. We should pray, "Lord, You have given everything to me, and I have received everything of You. Now I want to give You the cooperation. Lord, I am willing. I put myself into Your hands." We need a renewed consecration for the development of life within us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE SPIRIT<br>FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 4:24; 20:22; Acts 16:6-7; Rom. 8:9-10; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:16-18; Phil. 1:19; 1 Cor. 12:13, 3; John 3:6b; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; Heb. 4:12; Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4-6; Eph. 2:22</H1><P>Thus far, we have seen what life is, how life works within us, and how we need to cooperate with this life. Life is a matter in the spirit, that is, in the divine Spirit mingled with our human spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Life is the Spirit and the Spirit is life. Thus, if we are going to know life, to experience life, and to taste all the riches of life, we have to know this basic matter of the Spirit. I feel that the verses in the Scripture reading can give us a full picture of the Spirit for life. We need to see something in a fresh way, in a new way, and in a deeper way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRIUNE GOD'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS<br>AND ATTAINMENTS</H2><P>John 4:24 says that God is Spirit. We are told by the Bible that in time God created the universe. Later, God took the step of being incarnated. Creation is to bring things into existence. Incarnation is to bring God into the things that exist (John 1:14). Although creation brought things into existence, the created things had nothing to do with God. God was only the Creator, but incarnation brought God into His creature. He was the Creator, yet He became one with His creature, man. He even became one of the creatures; He became a man. This man's name was Jesus. Jesus was God mingled with man, the God-man. Jesus was the Creator mingled with the creature. We all have to know Jesus to such an extent. Jesus was a God-man, a man having God mingled with Him as one. In this little man, you could see both man and God, both the creature and the Creator.</P><P>Then this wonderful Person with the divine nature and the human nature, with divinity and humanity, lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, passing through all the sufferings of human life. At the end of His human life, He was put on the cross. That means He went into death and tasted death. He conquered death, broke through death, and walked through and out of death. All human beings are captured by death. Not one human being is willing to die. Only one Person, Jesus, was willing to die. He walked into death, through death, and out of death. Acts 2:24 says that death could not hold Him. Death tried its best to hold Him, but death failed. It could not hold Him, because He is the resurrection and the life. Death cannot hold life, but life can swallow up death. Death cannot hold resurrection, but resurrection gets through death. Christ walked into death's region and territory, but death could not affect Him. He had a tour, a sightseeing, of death.</P><P>When He went into death, He brought all the things of the old creation to an end. This included the termination of the old heaven, the old earth, and all the negative, sinful, and dark things. Satan, sin, the world, the flesh, the old man, and the old creation were brought to the cross (Heb. 2:14; John 1:29; Rom. 8:3; John 12:31; Rom. 6:6). The cross is the termination of the old creation. You were terminated there. Before you were born, you were terminated already on the cross by the death of Christ (Gal. 2:20). Death could not do anything with Christ, but by death He brought everything to an end. He terminated the entire old creation.</P><P>Then He was buried. He brought everything into the tomb, including us. After burial He was resurrected. By incarnation He put on the flesh of man. Now by death and resurrection, He was transformed from the flesh into the Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." He was the last Adam in the flesh, but by death and resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit.</P><P>On the evening of the day of His resurrection, He came to His disciples. The disciples were afraid of the Jews, so they were in a room with the doors shut. Suddenly Jesus came and stood in their midst (John 20:19). He came to them not in the way of the flesh but in the way of the Spirit. He did not teach the disciples or tell them what to do. Instead, He breathed into them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (v. 22).</P><P>To receive the Holy Spirit, the holy breath, is better than thousands of messages. Christ did not come to them as a big teacher, but as the best Breather. He is not a teaching, but the breath. He breathed Himself into them. The end of the Gospel of John says nothing about His departure, because He was in them. Later, they went to the sea to go fishing, and Christ was there (21:1-14). Wherever they went, Christ was there, because He was within them in a mysterious way, in a spiritual way, in a way like the air. Wherever you go, the air follows you. Regardless of how much you try, you cannot get away from the air. Christ today is the life-giving pneuma, the life-giving breath, the life-giving air.</P><P>After His resurrection He ascended to the heavens, and He was crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9). He was enthroned and given the highest name, the headship, the lordship, and the kingship in the kingdom, including all authority both in heaven and on earth (Eph. 1:20b-23; Acts 2:36; 5:31). Acts 2 tells us that on the day of Pentecost, He came down as a mighty wind (vv. 1-2). When the breath is intensified and strengthened, it becomes the wind. In a soft way He is the breath. In a strong way He is the wind. The wind brings us the fresh air. The Spirit as the breath was after His resurrection. The Spirit as the wind was on the day of Pentecost.</P><P>In the Epistles there are a number of titles for the Spirit. Acts 16:7 speaks of the Spirit of Jesus, and in verse 6 there is the Holy Spirit. If you read these two verses, you can see that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus. These two terms are interchangeably used. Jesus was a suffering man, so the Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of a man with abundant strength for suffering. Then in Romans 8:9-10 there is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ. These three titles are also interchangeably used. This proves that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself. The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of the resurrected and life-giving Christ. Then Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of the incarnated, afflicted, and crucified Jesus and the resurrected, ascended, and enthroned Christ. First Corinthians 15:45b says that in resurrection Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. After His resurrection He is the breath that gives life.</P><P>After the eternal God accomplished creation, incarnation, crucifixion for redemption, resurrection, and ascension, He came down as the wind to blow through the whole earth. This wind includes everything that the Triune God has accomplished and attained. Within the wind are the elements of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and Christ's enthronement with His kingship, headship, and lordship. When He came down as the blowing wind to sweep through the whole earth, all these elements were within Him. In a sense, today He is still blowing and sweeping. We came into the Lord's recovery because of the blowing and sweeping wind. Today we are full of joy because we are under the blowing and the sweeping of the divine wind.</P><P>He came as the divine wind to baptize His chosen ones in the Spirit. He put all of His chosen people from the Jewish race and from the Gentiles into Himself. This is the baptism accomplished on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius (Acts 2:1-4; 10:44-45). We were all baptized there. Before we were born, we were crucified and regenerated. In the same principle, we were also baptized. The baptism in the Holy Spirit has been absolutely and completely accomplished. Through this baptism, the new man was born and the Body was produced. First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free..." Before we were born, we all were baptized. In the eyes of God, the Body has been produced, the new man has been born, and the New Jerusalem is already in existence. This is why the apostle John said in Revelation that he saw it (21:2). This is why the Bible says, "It is finished!" (John 19:30). Everything has been accomplished.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ENJOYING THE TRIUNE GOD WITH ALL<br>HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND ATTAINMENTS<br>IN OUR SPIRIT FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</H2><P>We need to see this vision. We have God, the creation, the incarnation, human living, crucifixion for redemption, burial, resurrection, the breathing of the Spirit, ascension, enthronement, and the descent of the Spirit as the wind to accomplish the baptism. Now the Body has been produced, the new man has been born, and the New Jerusalem is here. We are the human beings under the blowing of the divine wind. When we are in our spirit, we are one with this wind, this divine Person, and we are one with one another. But when we remain in our soul, that is, our mind, will, and emotion, we cannot have the church life. Instead, we are insulated from Christ and from the members of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The way to be recovered back to our spirit for the church life is by calling on the name of the Lord&#151;"O Lord Jesus." The more we call on the name of the Lord, the more we will be filled with Him. As we are filled with Him, the church life will spontaneously spread and there will be an increase in life and in number. When our mind, will, and emotion are flooded and filled with Christ as the Spirit, we will have the powerful, living church life. This church life is connected with the Triune God and all His accomplishments and attainments. In this church life, we enjoy the Triune God with His incarnation, human living, crucifixion for redemption, resurrection, and ascension. We also enjoy the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the life-giving Spirit as the breath and the wind. The church life is so rich, because the church life is one with the Triune God and all His accomplishments and attainments.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SECRET OF LIVING, WALKING,<br>AND HAVING OUR BEING IN AND ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXPERIENCING LIFE IN THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Now we need to spend some time to see how to experience life in the spirit. The experience of life is absolutely a matter in the two spirits: the divine Spirit and the human spirit. The Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the life-giving Spirit. He is the Spirit of life as the breath and the Spirit of power as the wind. This Spirit is both God and Christ. God, Christ, and the Spirit are one. They are not three Gods. They are the Triune God, one God with three mysterious and wonderful Persons. The Triune God became a man. He died on the cross, was buried, resurrected, and then He ascended to the heavens where He was enthroned and crowned with glory and honor. After all these accomplishments and attainments, He came down as the Spirit of power, the all-inclusive, mighty, living Spirit.</P><P>From that time He began to work and to move to gain His chosen people. His people were all chosen before the foundation of the world in eternity (Eph. 1:4). After He accomplished all things for His economy, He came down as the all-inclusive Spirit. He is the breath and the wind. He is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ. He is the Spirit who gives life and the Spirit of power. As such a Spirit He picks up all His chosen people and puts them into Himself to make them one Body. In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13). By this baptism the Body was produced and the new man was born. Now our life today is the wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit.</P><P>Our spirit is the central part of our being. When we live in our body, we are a very shallow person in the flesh. When we live in our soul, we are deeper, but still not so deep. We need to live in our spirit, the deepest part of our being. We may be sincere in our soul, but this sincerity is not the deepest sincerity. Our sincerity should be in our spirit. Our spirit is the deepest part of our being.</P><P>When we called on the Lord Jesus for the first time, we were saved. At that time the Lord Jesus as the divine Spirit, the Spirit of life and power, the life-giving Spirit as the all-inclusive Spirit, came into our spirit and we were regenerated. That which is born of the divine Spirit is our human spirit (John 3:6b). Our human spirit was regenerated by the divine Spirit, who is the realization of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. He came into our spirit and remains here to be our life. In our spirit we have the divine Person as our life.</P><P>Before we were saved, we did not have a life in our spirit. But now that we are saved, the divine Person, the divine Spirit, who is Christ Himself, is in our spirit to remain here and be our life. The divine Spirit is with our spirit, and these two spirits have become one spirit. This is why 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit." We are one spirit with the Lord. Our oneness with Him is not in our flesh or in our soul but in our spirit. Today Christ as the divine Spirit lives and stays in our spirit. Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit."</P><P>Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God. When we consider how poor we are, we may wonder how we can be the children of God. This is a doubt from our mental consideration. But when we turn to our spirit, we have the witness and the assurance that we are the children of God. If we were not the children of God, we would not call God "Abba, Father" (Rom. 8:15). The mind may doubt, but the spirit cries, "Abba, Father!" We have the assurance that we are the children of God, not in our mind, but in our spirit. We have to learn the lesson of rejecting the doubts in our mind and praising the Father from our spirit.</P><P>The Triune God is the all-inclusive Spirit within our spirit as our life. He stays here, dwells here, lives here, moves here, and acts here. The center of God's salvation is that this all-inclusive Spirit, who is Christ and God, is dwelling, living, moving, and acting in our spirit as our life. We are one with Him in our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TO DISCERN OUR SPIRIT FROM OUR SOUL</H2><P>We have to learn to discern our spirit from our soul. Hebrews 4:12 says that the word of God is living and operative as a sharp two-edged sword piercing to the dividing of soul and spirit. Just as we illustrated before, our mind as a part of our soul may doubt that we are a child of God, but our spirit still has the assurance that we are a child of God. Our mind is doubting, but our spirit is praising.</P><P>When we consider a certain brother in our mind, we may be unhappy with him, but deep within us, in the spirit, we would say that he is a good brother. Thus, we can see the difference between the soul and the spirit. The question is always, "Would we go along with our soul or with our spirit?" Many times we go along with the soul. We do not care for our spirit. When we go along with our spirit, we are one with all the brothers.</P><P>When a sister goes shopping, she may feel good in her soul about buying something, but there is a "no" deep within her spirit. Many times we are clear about the difference between our soul and our spirit, but we are short of grace. We would not go along with the sense in our spirit. Instead, we go along with our soul, and we are deadened by our unwillingness to follow the spirit.</P><P>Many times in our soul we like to talk and tell others certain things, but deep within our spirit we have the sense not to say much. At this time do we go along with our soul or with our spirit? Many times we go along with our soul to talk, and the more we talk, the more we are deadened. This again shows us the difference between the soul and the spirit.</P><P>Doctrinally, it is hard to discern the difference between the soul and the spirit, but practically, it is somewhat easy. We need to look to the Lord for His mercy that we could have the grace to go along with our spirit. The best way to take grace at such a juncture is to say, "O Lord." When we are in the department store, there might be a struggle between our soul and our spirit. If we call, "O Lord" repeatedly, this will bring us the grace to make us strong in the spirit. The grace will strengthen us to go along with the spirit. If we exercise our spirit in this way, a habit will be built up in us. Whenever there is a struggle between our soul and our spirit, we should always say, "O Lord, O Lord." When we say, "O Lord," we are in the spirit. When we open up our mouth to call on the name of the Lord, Satan will be chased away. This is the simple way to turn ourselves to the spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRACTICAL WAY TO WALK IN THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Galatians 5 tells us that we have to walk in the Spirit (vv. 16, 25), but how do we do this? Today we know the secret. It is by calling on the name of the Lord. In our family life it is rather hard to walk in the spirit. Before we talk to our children or to our spouse, we had better say, "O Lord Jesus," first. Then we will see the difference. We should not consider this as some kind of superstition. Calling on the name of the Lord is spiritual breathing. Breathing is not superstitious. In doing everything, you just breathe. If you do not breathe, you stop living.</P><P>The Bible says to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17), but how can we do this? Praying unceasingly is like breathing unceasingly. We can pray unceasingly by continually calling on the Lord. In doing everything, we need to say, "O Lord." We have to call on the name of the Lord Jesus without ceasing. To call on the name of the Lord by saying, "O Lord," will keep us in the spirit all the time. This is the secret of walking and living in the spirit.</P><P>Learn to breathe the Lord continually by calling on His name. If you do not call on the name of the Lord, whatever you have read or studied concerning spiritual things is mere knowledge in your mind. You may know that you have been crucified with Christ, but that is mere knowledge. If you call on the Lord's name by saying, "O Lord," this brings you into the spirit, and the death of Christ will be effective in your being through the spirit. All the truths you read and know must be realized by a living spirit. When you say, "O Lord," you keep yourself in a living spirit. Then all the knowledge from the Bible will be prevailing to you. It will become your reality. Regardless of how much you know, as long as it is the mere letter, it does not help. Instead, your knowledge kills you. The letter kills (2 Cor. 3:6). You need to turn from the letter to the spirit. You need to turn from your mind to the spirit by saying, "O Lord."</P><P>When you call on the Lord, you should not do it lightly or loosely. You should sincerely mean business with Him. Then when you call, you are connected with Him to enjoy Him as the heavenly electricity. Right away you have the inward transmission of the reality of the all-inclusive Spirit. You have to contact the living Lord, not by using your mind, but by using your spirit. The best and simplest way to use your spirit is to say, "O Lord." If you open up yourself by using your spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus, you will get into the spirit and be in the spirit. Whenever you call on Him, you are refreshed and empowered.</P><P>Romans 8:6 says that to set our mind on the flesh is death, but to set our mind on the spirit is life and peace. The main part of the soul is the mind. The mind is between the spirit and the flesh. There are two places for us to set our mind. When we exercise our mind to think apart from the spirit, we are setting our mind on the flesh. When we call on the name of the Lord, we are setting our mind on the spirit. To say, "O Lord," is not a small thing. Whenever we say, "O Lord," right away we turn our mind to the spirit. By continually calling on His name, we set our mind on the spirit, and that is life and peace. But when we turn our mind to the flesh, right away that is death.</P><P>Praise the Lord that by His mercy He has shown us the secret. It is so marvelous, real, and effective to call on the name of the Lord in every place (1 Cor. 1:2). When we say, "O Lord," we set our mind on our spirit, and we have the inner sensation of life and peace. The New Testament tells us that we have to walk in and according to our spirit (Rom. 8:4b). The way to do this is by calling on the name of the Lord all the time. Then we are really one with the Lord. Saying "O Lord" continually keeps us in the spirit so that we can walk and live in and according to our spirit.</P><P>Ephesians 2:22 says that we are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. The issue of such a living is the church life where God has a dwelling place among us. Our living in the spirit is not only the victorious Christian life but also the marvelous, wondrous church life. I am looking to the Lord that you all would take this and put it into practice. Then you will see that the Christian life and the proper church life are altogether a matter of life in and by the spirit.</P></body></html>
