   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BECOMING THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The ministry of the new covenant, a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness, will work out a condition of righteousness first in individuals, second in the church, and third in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the kingdom comes, there will be righteousness on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then everything will be satisfactory to God, and God will justify everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although the age of the kingdom has not yet come, we can have a foretaste of the righteousness of the kingdom today in the church life and in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes in a certain local church the condition may be such that everything, everyone, and every matter is justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a church is God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This kind of condition may also be present in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In a few cases I have seen that in a family whose members have been thoroughly saved there is a condition where nothing is wrong, but everything is satisfactory to God and justified by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a family is a family of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fruit of the new covenant ministry is to produce this kind of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chapters three, four, and five are all on the new covenant ministry and its ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this section consummates with Paul s word concerning the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of today s Christians know only that Christ died for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They do not realize that Christ died for them as the flesh, as the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in 2 Corinthians Paul does not speak of Christ dying for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, in 5:14 he says, One died on behalf of all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that Christ died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 Corinthians 15:3 Paul tells us that Christ died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order that our sins might be forgiven by God, Christ died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This, however, is simply the initial stage of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ died on the cross not only for our sins, but He died also for us, for our flesh, our natural being, our outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ died on the cross so that our outward man, our natural being, may be terminated in order that we may become God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, Christ died for our sins so that we may be forgiven and justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But Christ died for us so that we may become God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Becoming the righteousness of God is much deeper than being justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The new covenant ministry brings us back to God to such an extent that we actually become God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only are we justified by God, but we even become the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>SIN, FLESH, AND THE OUTWARD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 21 Paul says that Christ was made sin on our behalf so that we might become God s righteousness in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sin here is actually synonymous with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 1:14 says that Christ as the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second Corinthians 5:21 says that He was made sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to Romans 8:3, God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, sin and the flesh are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, since the flesh is our outward man, the outward man is totally sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We ourselves, our natural being, are nothing but sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For Christ to be made flesh was equal to His being made sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When He went to the cross, He brought this flesh with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that He brought us, our natural being, our outward man, to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In chapter four Paul speaks of the outward man, and in chapter five he speaks of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The outward man is the flesh, and the flesh is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the outward man, the flesh, and sin are synonymous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ in His incarnation was made flesh; that is, He was made sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This also means that He was made us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He was crucified, He brought our natural man, the outward man, the flesh, sin, to the cross and nailed it there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That was the time God condemned sin, the flesh, the outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When Christ died on the cross, God condemned our natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He condemned you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s goal in doing this was that we may become in Christ the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The resurrected Christ is righteousness, resurrection, and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In such a One we may become the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the issue, the result, the ultimate consummation, of God s salvation, and this is what the new covenant ministry will produce.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The conclusion of these chapters on the new covenant ministry and its ministers is simply the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Is your family life God s righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Are you the righteousness of God?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Is the church in your locality God s righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We believe that the new covenant ministry is working toward the goal of making us, our family life, and our church life the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then when the kingdom age arrives, God s righteousness will be on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The kingdom will bring in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this new heaven and new earth righteousness will dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the result and the consummation of the ministry of the new covenant.</S>
