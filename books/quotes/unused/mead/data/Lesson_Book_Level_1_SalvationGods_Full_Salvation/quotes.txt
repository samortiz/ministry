[1]  Lesson One SALVATION IN GOD S PLAN Scripture Reading Eph 3:9-11; 1:9-11; 1 Tim 1:4; Eph 3:2; Gen 1:26 Outline God s plan in eternity past God s good pleasure God s eternal purpose God s economy God s enemy God s salvation Text
[2]  Why does God want to save us and why can He alone save us?
[3]  To fulfill His eternal purpose, God needed to create man.
[4]  So, before God created anything, He selected certain ones.
[5]  Although we don t look much like Him today, we have confidence in His selection that one day we will be the many full-grown sons of God, full of His life to express Him and full of His dominion to represent Him.
[6]  Before we go any further, we need to see something of great importance to our understanding of God s full salvation.
[7]  When these many individual people become filled with the one living God, they become one corporate God-man.
[8]  AS A THREE-PART VESSEL Scripture Reading Gen 1:26; Rom 9:21-23; 1 Thes 5:23; Gen 2:7;
[9]  In Lesson One we saw God s marvelous eternal plan.
[10]  SIGNIFYING GOD AS LIFE TO MAN Scripture Reading Gen 2:9-10; John 1:4; 14:6; 10:10; 6:57; 7:37-38; Rev 22:1 Outline Man placed in the garden of Eden The tree of life in the garden s center Life needed for God s expression The tree of life signifying Christ The river of life quenching our thirst Text I. MAN PLACED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN
[11]  After God created man, He planted a beautiful garden and put the man there.
[12]  Even though God had created man in His image and according to His likeness, it was impossible for this man to express God without receiving Him as life.
[13]  Lesson Six THE FALL OF MAN Scripture Reading Gen 2:9-10, 17; 3:1-6; 1 Tim 2:14; Rom 5:18-19 Outline The two trees Dependence and independence Life and death Satan the enemy of God Satan deceives man The tragedy of the universe Two great problems Objective Subjective Illustration Text I. THE TWO TREES
[14]  In the last lesson, you may have noticed in Genesis 2:9 that there was another tree besides the tree of life.
[15]  That tree was the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[16]  By eating it, man fell and was completely ruined for God s purpose.
[17]  To have God as life makes man dependent on God.
[18]  When we do not take God as our life, but choose to live according to knowledge instead, we live independently from God and are not able to be filled with Him and express Him as He has planned.
[19]  While the tree of life represents God s life or God as life to man, the tree of knowledge represents Satan as the source of death.
[20]  Lesson Seven MAN S NEED OF SALVATION Scripture Reading Rom 5:18; John 3:36; Heb 9:27; Matt 25:41;
[21]  Rev 20:15; Eph 2:1-2; 4:17-18a; 2 Tim 3:2-4;
[22]  Because of this, when Adam was judged and came under God s condemnation, we were all judged and came under God s condemnation with him.
[23]  Rom 5:8; 1 John 3:1; 1 Pet 1:3; John 17:23;
[24]  We have now seen a general picture of man s fallen condition.
[25]  GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS Scripture Reading Rom 3:21-22; 1:17; 10:3;
[26]  Lesson Ten THE SAVIOR-GOD Scripture Reading Gen 3:15; 22:18; Isa 7:14; 9:6; John 1:1, 14; 1 Pet 3:18;
[27]  John 1:29; 3:14; 12:24; 1 Cor 15:45b; Gal 3:14 Outline Man s birthright to contain God as life The Savior promised by God.
[28]  The Savior prophesied by God The God-man Savior Incarnated Crucified Resurrected Text
[29]  God is not only our Judge because of His righteousness, but He is also our Savior-God because He loves us.
[30]  God judged man according to His righteousness after man sinned in the garden of Eden; yet because He loved man, He also promised to save him.
[31]  Heb 10:12; 9:28, 12, 14; 1 Pet 1:18-19 Outline What is redemption? to repossess at a cost Lost because of sin Redeemed by Christ s blood Text
[32]  In this lesson, we begin to cover five objective aspects of God s full salvation that solved our problem before God.
[33]  The first item is the redemption which Christ accomplished for us by His death on the cross.
[34]  Lesson Twelve FORGIVENESS AND CLEANSING OF SINS Scripture Reading Jer 31:34; Zech 13:1; Matt 26:28;
[35]  Heb 9:12-14, 22-23; 1 John 1:7-9; Rev 1:5 Outline Forgiveness of Sins Forgetting our Sins Forgiveness Cleansing Text I. FORGIVENESS OF SINS
[36]  Since we have offended God, we need His forgiveness; yet we cannot be forgiven before His righteousness is fulfilled.
[37]  But, if we die, God would have no one to receive His life for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.
[38]  Because of His death, God s righteous requirement has been met, and we can now be forgiven by God.
[39]  Lesson Thirteen JUSTIFICATION Scripture Reading Rom 3:22-24, 28; 4:25; 5:1; 8:33-34 Outline Justification by faith Based upon Christ s redemption Text
[40]  Romans chapter three, verses 23-26 says, For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus: whom God set forth a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood, for the showing forth of His righteousness in respect of the passing by of the sins that occurred before in the forbearance of God; for the showing forth of His righteousness in the present time, that He should be just and justify the one who is of the faith of Jesus.
[41]  Justification is God s action in approving people according to His standard of righteousness.
[42]  Lesson Fourteen RECONCILIATION Scripture Reading Rom 5:1, 10-11; Col 1:20-22; 2 Cor 5:18-19; Eph 2:13-18 Outline Man God s enemy Reconciled by Christ s death Text
[43]  Reconciliation means the action of bringing two parties back into oneness or harmony.
[44]  The Apostle Paul said, Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ Rom 5:1 .
[45]  He also said, For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.
[46]  And not only so, but we also are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation Rom 5:10-11 .
[47]  Through the redeeming death of Christ, God has justified us, the sinners, and has reconciled us, His enemies to Himself 5:1, 10-11 .
[48]  Lesson Fifteen REGENERATION Scripture Reading John 3:2-6; 1:12-13; 1 John 5:12;
[49]  With this lesson, we come to the first of five subjective aspects of God s full salvation regeneration.
[50]  Regeneration means that in addition to the life we received at our birth, we receive another life, the life of God.
[51]  God s intention is to have a group of people filled with Himself as their life that they may express Him in His image and represent Him with His authority.
[52]  Eph 5:26; John 17:17; 6:63 Outline To be made holy Holiness is God Himself Growth By His life Through the Spirit and the Word Text
[53]  The Spirit of God is now dwelling within us.
[54]  Lesson Seventeen TRANSFORMATION Scripture Reading Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:16-18; Eph 4:23; Col 3:10;
[55]  1 Pet 2:2-5; Eph 5:26-27; Rom 8:28-29 Outline An inward change A process of metabolism A new element replacing the old In our mind, emotion, will By the spreading of Christ By beholding the Lord with an unveiled face Text I. AN INWARD CHANGE
[56]  Transformation is the result of sanctification and is related to man s soul.
[57]  Eph 4:20-21 Outline Life-shape, life-power, life-essence Being conformed to the image of Christ By the growth of life and environmental dealings The mold and the dough Being conformed to the body of the Lord s glory Text
[58]  Romans 8:29 says, Because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers.
[59]  Today we are sons of God, but we do not yet have the full form, the complete shape, of sons of God.
[60]  Lesson Nineteen GLORIFICATION Scripture Reading John 1:14; Rom 3:23; 8:30; Col 1:27b; 3:4; 2 Thes 1:10a Outline Glory God expressed The blossoming of the seed Christ in us, the hope of glory At Christ s second coming Text
[61]  Glorification is the last step of our full salvation.
[62]  When we are glorified, we reach the climax of God s full salvation and enter into its full enjoyment for eternity.
[63]  According to the Bible, glory is just God expressed or the expression of God.
[64]  Lesson Twenty RECEIVING AND GROWING IN SALVATION Scripture Reading Rom 10:8b-15a, 17; Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; 1 John 1:9;
[65]  John 6:63; 1 Pet 2:2; Matt 4:4; 1 Thes 5:17; Heb 10:25.
[66]  Outline The initial stage Hearing the preaching Repenting Believing Confessing Being baptized The result The progressing stage Confessing our sins Reading His Word Calling on His name Praying Meeting with the church Text
[67]  Romans chapter 10 verses 8b-15a and 17 tell us that, The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart; that is, the word of the faith which we preach, that if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved; for with the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth man confesses unto salvation.
[68]  OF SALVATION Scripture Reading Heb 6:18; Psa 119:89; John 3:16; Acts 10:43;
[69]  These two portions of Scripture prove that once a person believes in the heavenly Father and believes into the name of the Son of God the Lord Jesus Christ , he has eternal life that is, the life of God .
[70]  Therefore, everyone who is begotten of God loves God and loves him who has been begotten of God, him who is a brother in the Lord.
[71]  Lesson Twenty-Two THREE STAGES OF SALVATION Scripture Reading Heb 2:3a; 12:1; Acts 26:19; 1 Cor 9:24; Phil 3:12-14;
[72]  2 Tim 4:7-8; Rev 22:12 Outline The initial stage The progressing stage The completing stage Our body transfigured Expressing and representing God The way to arrive Text
[73]  His salvation is in three stages according to our experience of life.
[74]  God s salvation is of three stages to fully save this three-part man.
[75]  God has done this firstly by His death on the cross to take care of our objective problem before God.
[76]  Lesson Twenty-Three REWARD AND PUNISHMENT Scripture Reading Matt 25:14-30; 1 Cor 3:10-15; 2 Cor 5:10 Outline For the believers Reward for the faithful and punishment for the lazy Text
[77]  Rather, it is a lifelong matter which the Apostle Paul and other writers in the Bible have likened to running a race.
[78]  God does not want His children to be lazy and sloppy in developing the salvation that they have been given.
[79]  This purpose was to have a group of people, a corporate man, filled up with Himself as life.
[80]  This corporate man would have His image to express Him and His dominion to represent Him and to rule over His enemy.
