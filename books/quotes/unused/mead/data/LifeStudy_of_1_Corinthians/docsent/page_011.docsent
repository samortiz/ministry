   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIVE CHRIST AND HIS CROSS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE UNIQUE SOLUTION TO ALL PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE CHURCH 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:10-13</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that Christ and His cross are the unique solution to all problems in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall consider this unique solution in a fuller way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. CHRIST A. The Center of God s Economy</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the center of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among the thousands of verses in the Bible, one verse is extremely crucial regarding this matter, and this verse is Colossians 3:11.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Speaking of the new man, Paul says, Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the light of this verse none of us should boast in matters of race or nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During my travels around the world, I have observed that everyone is proud of his country and race.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But as believers in Christ, we should not pride ourselves in our race or nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to Colossians 3:10 and 11, the church, the Body of Christ, is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the new man there are no distinctions of race or nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As Paul says, in the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Jews are known for their religion, and the Greeks, for their culture, especially for their philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, there is room for neither Greek nor Jew in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul goes on to say that there cannot be circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or freeman.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that in the new man there is no place for religion or culture, no matter what a particular culture may be.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Colossians 3:11 gives us a strong basis for saying that in God s economy Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is every person, every matter, and every thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ must be our race and nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If someone asks you to what race you belong, you should reply, I belong to the race of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should have the realization within that we are not Chinese, Germans, French, New Zealanders, Americans, or any other nationality, but are members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If all Christians knew that Christ is the center of God s economy, all divisions would disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not long ago I read that in a certain country members of a particular racial group held a meeting in a cathedral to celebrate an event which they regarded as a victory for their cause.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During this meeting, some things were said negatively about another racial group.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Afterwards, directly in front of the cathedral there was a clash between members of these different racial groups.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What a shame that such a confrontation could take place after a meeting which was supposedly held in the name of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a thing is utterly contrary to the nature of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the church as the new man there are no distinctions on the basis of color; there is no white, black, red, brown, or yellow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To repeat, in the new man Christ is everything; He is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In his preaching to the Corinthians, Paul testified to them of the all-inclusive Christ, of the Christ who is the center of God s economy and everything in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to his background, Paul was an authentic and typical Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As such, he should have avoided all social contact with Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But because Paul realized that in the new man there is no Jew or Greek but that Christ is everything, he could testify to the Greeks in Corinth concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He could say, I wish to testify that Christ is everything and that in the new man there cannot be Jew and Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the new man, I am not a Jew I am a person constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But although I have testified concerning this, you insist on remaining in your old social status.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have not taken Christ as the unique, all-inclusive center.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although I declare to you that I have dropped my religion and that I now uplift Christ, you still hold to your Greek culture and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You know that I was deeply involved with Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I advanced in Judaism beyond many others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But I have abandoned all this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I came to you, I decided not to know anything among you but Christ and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God does not care for Jewish religion or Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He cares only for Christ, because in His economy Christ is the center and everything to us.</S>
