   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS 7 Scripture Reading: Exodus 28:6-14; 39:2-9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 28:9 and 10 say, And you shall take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel: six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the remaining six on the other stone, according to their birth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 12 the record goes on to say, And you shall put the two stones upon the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, as stones of memorial for the sons of Israel; and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders for a memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The two onyx stones must have been very close in size to the size of a man s shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This would be quite likely, since they were put on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe that these two onyx stones were flat and either oblong or rectangular in shape.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each of them had to be large enough for six of the names of the children of Israel to be engraved on it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The shoulder-pieces were located at the place where the front and the back parts of the ephod came together, where they were joined at the shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This part of the ephod must have been thicker and stronger than any other part.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, because the shoulder-pieces were of one piece with the ephod, they should not be regarded as separate from the ephod itself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These pieces were one with the ephod as a whole and, joining the two parts together, they were strong enough to bear the onyx stones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order for the ephod to bear such heavy stones, it was necessary for the shoulder-pieces to be thick and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have seen that the ephod typifies Christ with His two natures, divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The two natures of Christ are mingled to bear the expression of God, signified by the gold, and the expression of man, signified by the linen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ also bears the expression of His heavenliness, kingship, and redemption typified respectively by the blue, the purple, and the scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is such an expression that becomes the material that bears the onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>ONYX STONES SIGNIFYING THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is signified by the two onyx stones borne upon the shoulders of the high priest?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These onyx stones signify the believers, including us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When some hear this, they may say, Perhaps you as an older brother in the Lord are signified by the onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But I certainly am not.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have been saved for only a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I do not have the appearance of an onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the contrary, I have the appearance of clay or dust.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps this is your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, as long as you have been regenerated, there is at least a small amount of onyx stone within you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you did not have the element of onyx stone in your being, you would have no interest in hearing this kind of message.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The very fact that you love the Lord and are seeking Him and that you want to hear this kind of word is a strong indication that there is at least some onyx stone in you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, all the clay will be transformed into onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With our natural being there are two aspects: the aspect of God s creation and the aspect of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Part of our natural being is the creation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Another part is of man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That which has its source in the fall of man will be shaken away, and that which comes from God s creation will remain with us and be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, God s work on us accomplishes two things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, it is shaking away, removing, the fallen aspect; on the other hand, it is uplifting and transforming the aspect of our being that is related to God s creation to become precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of course, it takes time for the fallen element to be removed and the created element to be transformed and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, many of those who have been in the church life for a number of years have experienced the shaking off of the fallen element and the transformation of the created element.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The result is that these saints are much weightier in Christ today than they were several years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some of the fallen element has been removed, and quite an amount of God s created element has been uplifted and transformed into precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not doubt the fact that we are signified by the onyx stones on the shoulders of the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One day, we shall be fully transformed into onyx stone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have the full expectation both for myself and for all the saints that eventually we shall be onyx stones in a pure and complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth, all the believers in Christ will be precious stones.</S>
