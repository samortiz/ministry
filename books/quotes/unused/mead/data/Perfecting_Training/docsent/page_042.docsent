   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BOUND TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I was a child we had a lot of three-legged races.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Two people had two legs tied together so that they had to coordinate as one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to realize that today you and the Lord Jesus are bound together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You and He are racing in a three-legged race.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Don t run just by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you do you will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Don t forget that you are one with Him, and you are living with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not many can run a three-legged race.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You wouldn t care for the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You would cut off the binding.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You would free yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all have done this concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a sense we all have told the Lord: Lord, You stay here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let me go ahead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Don t come along with me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If You come I can t get my thing done.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, give me a little freedom for just half a day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just for Saturday afternoon I m on vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But we all have learned regardless of how much we would ask the Lord leave, He would never give it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may cut the binding, but He would bind it again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we would try to take a vacation, we simply get in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The point is this: God s economy is just to put Christ together with us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is our destiny whether this seems poor or whether this seems very much blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It depends upon your realization.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is your destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>MARRIED TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, the marriage life should be a life always with two together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we love the marriage life, sometimes we realize it is a binding and bothering life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you open the window, your husband may complain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you put some water on the plant, he says you put too much.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Also, whatever you do, she would say something.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the marriage life we all are good complainers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The disciples told the Lord Jesus it is better not to get married Matt 19:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Lord said that it was not up to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You must have the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You need a gift not to have a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But most of us didn t receive such a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In like manner God has ordained that we must have a husband.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God doesn t want us to live single or as a widow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must have a husband, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is God s ordination, and this is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must live a life of two together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God had no intention for you to live a life just by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you try to live in that way you will get into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That is against God s divine principle, and that is kicking against God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You can never get through.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So we have to take Christ as our life and live with Him like two persons who are living one life together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to live such a life, and to live such a life is to always call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, using our daily expression, we just talk to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Don t stop talking with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Talk to Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While you are talking to your wife, talk to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While you are talking to your boss or employee, talk to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Don t do any talking just by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Don t forget that you should never be single.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You re not destined to a single life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You are now living a marriage life, and your husband is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all have Him as our husband.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must live with our husband.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Don t go anywhere without Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Don t do anything without Him, and don t say anything without Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All the time you have to do things with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now I have the assurance that I know what it means to pray unceasingly and how we can pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is this: all the day long you should call on Him; you should talk to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>By this you are breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is to live spiritually, and to live spiritually is just to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I do believe this kind of fellowship hits the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You have to come back to this point: you must do all things by talking to the Lord, by praying to Him, by calling on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is to breathe that you may live Him.</S>
