BY STAYING IN CONTACT WITH HIM</h2>
<p>If we practice praying over the Word, we will experience the Lord in a very living way, and after a period of time we will be accustomed to speaking to the Lord in a very living yet ordinary and conversational way. We will speak with the Lord not only when we are by ourselves in a private room but also while we are talking with others. We will be constantly in contact with the Lord. Our prayer will be spontaneous and automatic, as natural to us as breathing (1 Thes. 5:17).</p>
<p>Many of us may have been Christians for a long time, yet we still are not accustomed to contacting the Lord. We may feel that in order to pray, we have to be in a private room on our knees. But we must practice contacting the Lord at every time and under every kind of circumstance. We can speak to the Lord while we are walking on the street or while we are working or are busy with various matters. If we are about to lose our temper, we should tell the Lord, &ldquo;O Lord, I am about to lose my temper.&rdquo; If we are about to criticize someone, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am about to criticize.&rdquo; We must simply contact the Lord and tell Him everything, and then He will be our adjustment and correction. He will be the antibiotic to kill all the germs of our temper and criticism.</p>
<p>What does it mean to abide in the Lord? To abide in the Lord is to be in contact with the Lord all the time. It is not we who are living but it is the Lord who lives with us and in us in a practical way. As Paul says in Galatians 2:20, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; If we contact the Lord and receive Him as the life supply, He will revolutionize our entire life. For instance, suppose we intend to write a letter to someone, but before writing it, we contact the Lord and tell Him that we are going to write such a letter. When we do this, the Lord will do something within us at that very moment, and consequently, the way in which we write the letter will be revolutionized. It will no longer be we who are writing the letter, but the Lord in us will be writing the letter. In every situation we can contact the Lord in such a way.</p>
<p>If we contact the Lord in this way, the Lord as the Spirit in our spirit will become the life supply to us, and we will be strengthened and refreshed. Furthermore, we will spontaneously know what to do, regardless of our situation, because the Lord will be living in us in a practical way. We will be living not by our natural life but by the Lord Himself, and we will be living another kind of life, a life not by ourselves but a life with the Lord. This is the life of the branch abiding in the vine (John 15:4-5). This is how to make real the mingling of God with man and the oneness of the Body. The more we contact the Lord and live by, through, and in Him, the more we will realize the oneness of the Body. The way to be truly one is not by exhorting each other to be united; rather, the way to be one is to contact the Lord in a living way moment by moment and to live in Christ. Then we will automatically and spontaneously be in the life of the Body and have the oneness of the Body. Whatever we do, we must contact the Lord first.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: Often I have found that after reading one or two verses, I cannot find anything in the verses over which to pray. In those instances, should I pray for other matters?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should not make this practice of praying over the Word something legal. If you read a few verses without any understanding of them, how can you pray? You may have to read several verses or even half a chapter in order to understand something and be able to pray. The main thing is that instead of merely receiving the Word as knowledge with our mind, we must exercise our spirit to pray over the Word. We must exercise to contact the Lord with our spirit so that the Lord can be our life and life supply and so that we can carry out our daily living by this supply.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should we pray over the Old Testament as well as the New Testament? It seems that it would be easier to pray over the New Testament because it clearly presents the different aspects of Christ, whereas in the Old Testament they are hidden.</em></p>
<p>Answer: This is a matter of the growth in life. A baby cannot take solid food; he must be given things that are easy to eat. Then when he grows older and stronger, he can eat the more solid food. As we practice to pray over the Word, we will grow in life and improve in our understanding of the Word. Eventually, we will realize that the entire Bible, including the Old Testament, reveals the riches of Christ. In fact, many verses in the Old Testament are even richer than those found in the New Testament.</p>
<p><em>Question: Is this kind of prayer something that you do only as an individual, or can it be done in a group as well?</em></p>
<p>Answer: First we should practice praying over the Word individually. Then we may be led to do this with some other saints. Eventually, we may advance to reading and praying with a large group in the meeting. It would be very good for the brothers and sisters to come together in a meeting to read the Word and then to pray over the Word. These prayers will touch our heart and saturate, strengthen, refresh, and illuminate our spirit.</p>
<p>What we lack today is a living contact with the Lord. We need to contact the Lord more than we need to read, study, and learn about spiritual matters. Our need is to contact the Lord Himself, because it is not Christianity or Christian teachings but the Lord Himself who is life and the life supply to us. Of course, if we are going to contact the Lord in a proper way, we must know about Him and study the Word. We surely need the proper teachings, but if we keep these teachings in our mind instead of using them for our prayer, they can damage us. Thus, our urgent need today is to constantly contact the Lord in our spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
