   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HIDDEN WEAKNESS AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A SHAMEFUL INTERCESSION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible is an honest book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After Genesis 18 and 19, in which we see Abraham's high attainment in his experience of God, there is a record of his weakness in Genesis 20.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Can you believe that after having such intimate fellowship with God and after making such a glorious intercession, Abraham could have the experience recorded in chapter twenty?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is difficult to believe and understand how Abraham could have shown such weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once again we see that the Bible is not man-made.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If it were of human manufacture, the writer would not have included this record of Abraham's weakness and shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the Bible is honest and it has Genesis 20 as part of the divine record.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>6 The Hidden Weakness and</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>a Shameful Intercession</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I was young, I appreciated chapters eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-two, and twenty-four, but I had no interest in chapter twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this chapter two main things are recorded: the hidden weakness and a shameful intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Abraham, a man of God, had a weakness hidden deep within him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While in chapter eighteen he made a glorious intercession, in chapter twenty we find the record of a shameful one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>a The Hidden Weakness 1 Journeying toward the South</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us first consider Abraham's hidden weakness 20:1-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 1 we are told that "Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Abraham's journeying toward the south meant that he had left the standing of fellowship at the oaks of Mamre in Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He should have remained in Hebron because there he had intimate fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nothing is better than this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was not too long after he had intimate fellowship with God that he left Hebron and journeyed southward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Between the time the Lord spoke to Abraham regarding the birth of Isaac in 17:21 and 18:14 and the time of Isaac's birth in chapter twenty-one, there could not have been more than a year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why did Abraham suddenly leave Hebron and journey toward the south during that year?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In figure, south signifies easiness and north hardships.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The south is warm and the north is cold, but God dwells in the north Psa 48:2; 75:6-7; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the north we have hardships with God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the south we have easiness, but without God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no hint in Genesis 20 that God told Abraham to journey southward.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In making this journey, Abraham acted on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Abraham might have wanted to have a change and take a vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although you may be enjoying the church life in Anaheim, one day you may feel that you need a change and desire to journey southward to Mexico City.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church life is marvelous and we all enjoy it very much.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But some may become a little bored and want to take a trip to Las Vegas.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you go to Las Vegas and meet someone there who asks about what you do at home, you will find it difficult to give him an honest answer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On two occasions, when Abraham was in such a situation, he was not truthful cf.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>12:9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In chapter twelve Abraham journeyed southward because there was a famine in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That famine gave him an excuse for going southward to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But in this chapter Abraham had no excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He and his wife might have been bored and wanted a vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If they had remained by the oaks of Mamre in Hebron, Abraham would have had no need to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His lying was due to his wrong position.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We see by this that the proper standing means a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I do not believe that any brother can pray-read or give a living testimony in a casino in Las Vegas.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He would not have the standing there to do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to do anything for God, we must have the proper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When Abraham left the standing of intimate fellowship with God and journeyed southward, he lost God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible does not say that in the south country God appeared to Abraham, nor that Abraham erected an altar and called on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He had altogether lost the proper standing on which he could have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Young people, you must see that you need to stay in the right position.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you stay in the church, you will be kept and preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if you journey southward, you will forsake the proper standing and lose God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Spontaneously, your old man will return.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before chapter twenty Abraham was circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In chapter twenty, he should have been a circumcised person, not a natural person, for he had truly been dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some Christians claim that once they have experienced a certain blessing, they can no longer be in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But look at the example of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although he had been circumcised both physically and spiritually, when he left the proper standing of fellowship with God, he was in the flesh again.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After having such a high attainment in his experience with God, Abraham, the father of faith, acted the same as he did in Genesis 12, more than twenty years before.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By this we see that as long as we are still in the old creation we are capable of doing anything in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we do not remain in fellowship with God, we can do the same things that the worldly people do.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not say that because you have been regenerated, have experienced the baptism of the Spirit, or have had a second blessing, you can no longer be in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However many are the blessings that you have received from God, if you do not remain in fellowship with Him, you will be in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Your experience proves that this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should never have any confidence in our self.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The self is absolutely untrustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must put our trust in the presence of the Lord, telling Him, "Lord, if You take Your presence away from me, I am just a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But I praise You that in Your presence I'm a saint, one of the people of God."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How much God's presence means to us!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When Abraham was bringing God on His way in chapter eighteen, he was a wonderful saint, a man who could stand before God and talk face to face with Him as with an intimate friend.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But in chapter twenty this wonderful person became very mean.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After he had left the standing of fellowship with God, he could lie at the sacrifice of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It seems unbelievable, but he did it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we consider our past experience, we shall find that at least a few times we have done the same kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This shows us the importance of remaining in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our protection is not our self; it is His presence.</S>
