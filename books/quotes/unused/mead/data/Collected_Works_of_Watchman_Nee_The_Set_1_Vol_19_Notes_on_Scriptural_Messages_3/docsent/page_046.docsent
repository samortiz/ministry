   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Third Answer</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One brother said, "If, as you said, some will be raptured before the tribulation whereas others will be raptured after it, will not the church lose its hope for the rapture this way?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is most cruel to say, as you have advocated, that a minority will be raptured first, while the majority will be left behind to pass through the tribulation before they will be raptured."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My answer is that the hope of the whole church's being raptured before the tribulation is an empty hope in any case, because the Bible never says that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since this is a vain hope anyway, it is better that we tell people about it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this way they will know that the rapture is not based on their salvation in life, but on the scriptural works that they perform after they have received such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>D. The Fourth Answer</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our friends quote 1 Corinthians 15:23, which says, "But each one in his own order: the firstfruits, Christ; then those who are Christ's at His coming."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here it only mentions "those who are Christ's" without making any further distinction; it does not say how a person's work should be after salvation, and it does not say anything about watching and beseeching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What they say is true for this passage, but they cannot add other things to the passage.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, there is a law in China which says, "Every Chinese citizen has his right as a citizen of China."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But as soon as a citizen of China breaks some law, he will lose his right as a citizen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Can he argue that he still has a right based on the clause, "Every Chinese citizen has his right as a citizen of China"?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, he cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 3 says that those who are born again can enter the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But there are many other Scriptures that tell us that those who have been regenerated and have eternal life may not necessarily receive the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, 1 Corinthians 15 is not on the rapture but on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From the first verse until the last verse, it is on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The rapture is something that men put into their reading.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is true that the resurrection of a Christian is based on the fact that he belongs to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>E. The Fifth Answer</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our friends ask that if this is the case, what will happen to those believers who are dead?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If those Christians who do not do well will have to pass through the tribulation and will suffer more, what will happen to those Christians who have not done so well and have died?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Does this mean that they will not have to pass through the tribulation?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If that is the case, does it not mean that they will come off better than the first group?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My answer is that we do not have to worry about this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God will never be unjust.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As Abraham said, "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Gen 18:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not our business but God's business.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the same time, it seems that this group of people will indeed suffer something.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps they will not go through the tribulation, but they will have to stand before the judgment seat and will receive their recompense, because 2 Corinthians 5:10 says, "For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This has nothing to do with salvation or perdition, but it has to do with the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The entrance of the kingdom is something decided by us ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>F. The Sixth Answer</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our friends quote 1 Corinthians 15:51, which says, "We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Does not the word "all" denote that there will be only one rapture?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One brother said that the Bible only distinguishes the wheat from the tares but does not distinguish the wheat from other wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As such is the case, there is only one rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is true that there is the distinction between the wheat and the tares.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But there is also the distinction between one kind of wheat and another kind of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Leviticus 23 is one example of it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First there is the firstfruit, and then there is the general harvest, and finally there are the gleanings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only does Leviticus say this; Revelation 14 has this distinction also.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First there is the firstfruit, and then there is the general harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I also believe that we all will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the Bible is limited to saying that we all will be changed; it does not say that we all will be raptured at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moreover, 1 Corinthians 15 is on resurrection; it is not on the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I admit that 1 Corinthians 15 runs parallel to 1 Thessalonians 4, but the emphasis in 1 Corinthians 15 is different.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is true that we will all be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the Bible does not say that we will all be raptured at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Why should we add on something that the Bible has not said?</S>
