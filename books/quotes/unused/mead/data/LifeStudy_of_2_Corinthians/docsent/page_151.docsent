   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE PAUL S VINDICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY 6 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 12:1-10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second Corinthians 12:1-10 is an excellent portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These verses show that Paul was deep and also profoundly wise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Judaizers boasted of how much they knew, claiming to be more knowledgeable than the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead of arguing with them, Paul first boasted of his weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now in 12:1-10 he comes to visions and revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul s wise strategy is to defeat the arrogant Judaizers by showing that actually they do not have any vision or revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What the Judaizers know is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>PAUL S PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that Paul s purpose in writing these ten verses is to show to the believers at Corinth that he was much more knowledgeable than the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had the knowledge not only of human life on earth, but also of the things in Paradise and even in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul not only knew these things; he also had a vision of them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul referred to this so that the follies of the Judaizers would be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the Corinthians compared what Paul knew and what he had seen with the knowledge possessed by the Judaizers, they would say, The Judaizers are superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have only a little knowledge of the Old Testament concerning the Mosaic law and the traditional rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But here is a man with a full knowledge of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He has a knowledge of human life and of things in Paradise and in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>PAUL S BOAST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I would say that in 12:1-10 we have Paul s chief boast.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Apart from the Lord Jesus, has there ever been a person besides Paul who has seen the things in the third heaven and in Paradise?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As God, the Lord Jesus was in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then He became a man on earth, died on the cross, and went to Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, He traveled through the heavens, the earth, and the region under the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul, a man born on earth, went to the third heaven and saw what was there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He also went to Paradise and beheld the things there under the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be sure, no one in human history can compare with the Lord Jesus and the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What could the Judaizers possibly say about this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 12:1 Paul says, To boast is necessary, though indeed not expedient; yet I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The apostle was forced to boast because of the Corinthians follies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Though it was not expedient to himself, it was necessary for their profit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He must boast so that they might be brought back, for their building up, to a sober and proper understanding concerning their relationship with the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word come in this verse means that Paul would now come to boast of the visions and revelations he has received of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 1 Paul speaks of both vision and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revelation is the putting aside of the veil, the unveiling of hidden things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Vision is the sight, the view, seen at the unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So many things concerning God s economy and administration in the universe were hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord has revealed, unveiled, these things to the apostle, and he has received visions of these hidden things.</S>
