This is the proper way to understand not only the Bible, but also any kind of writing. Suppose your father writes you a long letter in which he speaks about many things. At a certain point, he may say, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have adequate knowledge, you will not be able to understand these things.&rdquo; The phrase &ldquo;these things&rdquo; certainly refers to all the matters previously mentioned in the letter. In like manner, the things of man in 2:11 must refer to what Paul has said concerning man in the foregoing verses. The same is true regarding the things of God. By this we can see that 1 Corinthians 1 and 2 give us a revelation, a clear view, of both man and God. In these chapters we see a picture of man and also of God.</p><p>These two chapters give us simultaneously a portrait of both God and man. In 1 Corinthians 1 and 2 we have a twofold vision, a vision of the things of God and of the things of man. Have you seen this twofold vision? Have you seen that within Paul&rsquo;s portrait of man we also have a portrait of God? Have you seen that as we behold the things of man in these chapters, we see the things of God? What a marvelous revelation is contained here!</p><p>We have pointed out that, in principle, both the things of man and the things of God in 2:11 refer to what Paul has already written in this Epistle concerning man and God. Thus, if we would know the things of man and the things of God, we must consider what Paul covers in these chapters.</p><h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF THE THINGS OF MAN</h2><p>In 1:10-12 Paul speaks of certain things of man. For example, in verse 10 he says, &ldquo;Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing.&rdquo; Speaking the same thing is certainly one aspect of the things of man. We may think that speaking the same thing is a common, ordinary matter. However, have you ever seen a group of people who always spoke the same thing? Do you know of even one married couple who truly speak the same thing? It is very difficult for a husband and wife to speak the same thing. Brothers, how often do you and your wife speak the same thing? In 1:10 Paul urges all the believers at Corinth to speak the same thing. This kind of speaking is not an aspect of the life of fallen man, but an aspect of saved people. When I read this verse years ago, I shook my head in disbelief. To me, it was impossible for all the believers in a locality ever to speak the same thing. Does everyone in the church in your locality speak the same thing? It is a fact that we often speak different things both in the church life and in our married life. Speaking differently is a predominant characteristic of fallen man. The failure to speak the same thing causes many problems both in married life and in the church life. But even though it is common for us to speak different things, the desire of God is that all His saved and redeemed people speak the same thing. Thus, according to this desire, Paul beseeches the believers at Corinth to speak the same thing.</p><p>In 1:10 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;That there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.&rdquo; Here we have divisions, the mind, and opinions, all of which are things of man. Here Paul touches the mind. Often we may not speak differently, but inwardly we hold to different opinions. For example, a brother may say that sisters should wear a head covering. Although his wife may not say anything, inwardly she may disagree with him. This shows that this brother and his wife are not of the same opinion. According to Paul&rsquo;s word in 1:10, we should not only speak the same thing, but also be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.</p><p>We often have different opinions in the church life. For instance, one brother may prefer a smart elder, another brother may prefer one who is gentle, and yet another brother may prefer an elder who is slow and deliberate. This exposes the fact that among these brothers there are different opinions. Such opinions certainly are aspects of the things of man.</p><p>In 1:11 Paul continues, &ldquo;For it was made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you.&rdquo; The strifes mentioned in this verse are also things of man. In verse 12 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Now I mean this, that each one of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.&rdquo; Here we have the preferences among the Corinthians. These preferences also are things of man.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 Corinthians &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
