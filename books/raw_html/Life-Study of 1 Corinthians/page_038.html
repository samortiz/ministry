<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS WISDOM<br />TO US FROM GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:24, 30</h1><p>In 1:24 Paul says, &ldquo;But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom.&rdquo; This is an important verse. Here Paul says that to those who are called, the ones who were chosen by God in eternity and who have come to believe in Christ, Christ is God&rsquo;s power and wisdom. As those who have been called by God to call on the name of the Lord, Christ is God&rsquo;s power and wisdom to us.</p><h2 class="head1">ASPECTS OF CHRIST AS OUR PORTION</h2><p>In 1:30 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, Who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; Why does Paul, after pointing out that Christ is theirs and ours and that we have been called into His fellowship, say that this very Christ has become wisdom to us from God, both righteousness, sanctification, and redemption? We have seen that to be called into the fellowship of Christ means to be called into the co-enjoyment of Christ as our unique portion. In the second part of chapter one Paul shows us various aspects of the enjoyment of this wonderful portion. We may use a chicken dinner as an illustration. When you are served a platter of chicken, the host may ask you what part of the chicken you prefer, the wings, the breast, or the leg. In verses 24 and 30 we have different aspects of Christ; we have the &ldquo;wings,&rdquo; &ldquo;breast,&rdquo; and &ldquo;legs&rdquo; of Christ for our enjoyment. In verse 2 Paul speaks of our portion, and in verse 9 he tells us that we have been called into the enjoyment of this portion. Now in verses 24 and 30 we see the aspects of this portion for our enjoyment. From these verses we realize that we may enjoy Christ as God&rsquo;s wisdom and God&rsquo;s power. Furthermore, Christ as God&rsquo;s wisdom includes righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. My burden in this message is to consider from the standpoint of our experience how Christ is wisdom to us from God, including righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE WAY</h2><p>It is not easy to understand or explain wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. I prefer to speak of these matters according to spiritual experience. In verses 24 and 30 the wisdom of God denotes the divine way. If we have wisdom, we shall know the proper way to do things. But if we are not wise, our way of doing things will be foolish. In order to have the best way, we must have wisdom. Wisdom in these verses is equal to the way in John 14:6, a verse where the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the way.&rdquo; Apart from Christ as the way, we do not have access to the Father. Hence, God&rsquo;s way is His wisdom. How can we enjoy God and participate in Him? If we would enjoy Him and participate in Him, we must have a way, and this way is God&rsquo;s wisdom.</p><p>We may use learning to drive an automobile as an illustration of the relationship between wisdom and the way. One who is learning to drive may find it difficult to turn the car. Because he does not have adequate wisdom, he does not have the way to turn the car properly. However, a skillful and experienced driver has the wisdom to manage the car. He has the way to control it, to make it go where he desires. This way is the driver&rsquo;s wisdom.</p><p>As wisdom to us from God as God&rsquo;s way, Christ is righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Actually, these are three steps of the way. This understanding is, of course, related to our experience.</p><p>Suppose a sister has a problem with her husband. She exercises her spirit and calls on the name of the Lord Jesus. As a result, she is rescued from the problem. To speak more exactly, she receives Christ as wisdom to her from God. Before she learned to exercise her spirit and call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, she would argue with her husband. This is foolish. Nevertheless, wives often argue with their husbands, trying to convince them and even to subdue them. For example, a certain husband may habitually come home late. Relying on her natural wisdom, the wife may try to change her husband&rsquo;s behavior. However, the more she argues with him, the more frequently he comes home late. His wife&rsquo;s arguing actually causes the problem to become worse. Instead of arguing with her husband, the wife should exercise her spirit and call on the name of the Lord. Then she will have the wisdom, the way, to deal with the problem.</p>
