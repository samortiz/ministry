<h1 class="title">THE PEACE OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Col. 1:20</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The problem in the universe
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The biggest problem in the universe is disharmony among all the creatures. Everything in the universe has this problem with God.</li>
	<li>The reason the creatures are in disharmony with God is that man is in disharmony with God. This is due to man&rsquo;s sin. For example, mosquitoes and insects bite, and animals kill each other. This is all because man is out of harmony with God, which is the result of man&rsquo;s sin. When sin came in, the whole universe became full of chaos.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The peace of the universe
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The universe is out of harmony because of man&rsquo;s sin. Therefore, before the universe can have peace, man&rsquo;s sin must be removed.</li>
	<li>Man&rsquo;s sin was removed when Christ shed His blood on the cross. Thus, through the shedding of His blood, Christ made peace in the universe.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The function of the peace of the cross
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The peace of the cross firstly reconciles man to God.</li>
	<li>The peace of the cross also reconciles all things in the universe to God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to obtain the peace of the cross
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess your own sin and your disharmony with God.</li>
	<li>Confess that Jesus died on the cross for your sins.</li>
	<li>Accept the Lord Jesus to be your Savior and your peace with God.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
