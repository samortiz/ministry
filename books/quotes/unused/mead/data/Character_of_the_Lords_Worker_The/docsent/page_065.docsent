   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have a burden before the Lord, we should tell the brothers and sisters about it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is good if they take our word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if they do not take it, we should be happy to turn away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should never impose our thought upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has never done this, and neither should we.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a man chooses to rebel against God, He allows him to take his way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If others do not want to take our way, why should we insist?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to learn to give up our insistence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to allow others to turn away from our advice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we have learned the proper lessons before the Lord, we will gladly allow others to take their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not force others to listen to us or to take our way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not force others to receive our help.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may be clear about our function, but we should not force others to accept our function.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God never forces anyone, and we should not force anyone either.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>None of us can be subjective in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>None of us should try to make others listen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us learn to be attentive before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more others listen to us, the greater is our responsibility before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How great a responsibility we have to bear if we say a wrong word to others!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not rejoice at others taking our word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to remember the tremendous responsibility that is upon our shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is too great a thing for others to listen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If others listen to us when our way is crooked and we are not clear about God's will, we are truly the blind leading the blind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only will the blind who follow us fall into the pit, but both who are blind, ourselves and our followers, will fall into the pit Luke 6:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Never think that only followers fall and that leaders perhaps can escape the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the blind lead the blind, both fall into the pit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not think that it is easy to speak, easy to teach, and easy to advise others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not think that it is a simple thing to say, "You should do this," or "You should do that."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we become teachers to many, instructing them to do this and that, there is the danger that both we and they will end up in the pit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, we have to learn to fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should realize that the more others listen to us, the more we should hear God's word in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even when we are one hundred twenty percent sure of something, we should only say it with seventy to eighty percent assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should be afraid of making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The easier it is for a man to speak weighty words, the less weighty he is before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more confidence a person has, the less trustworthy he is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should never think that as long as others listen to us, everything will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everything is not fine when others listen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What will we do to these obedient ones?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where will we lead them?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to realize the seriousness of our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why we have to learn to not be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One problem with subjectivity is a craving for others' ears.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A subjective person likes to have others listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He wants his ideas to be a source of direction for others and his opinions to be a source of light for others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But we have to realize that our opinions are not a source of light and our ideas are not a source of direction.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must learn to not lead others by the hand, learn to not force others to go our way, and learn to not impose obedience to God upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the brothers and sisters are happy to go along with us, we should thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If they want to choose their own ways, let them make their own choices.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not try to drag others along with us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should allow others to come and go as they wish.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One characteristic of a man who knows God is a hesitation to force anyone to listen to him.</S>
