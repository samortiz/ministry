<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VERSUS DIVISION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Divisions (Sects) Being of the Flesh</H2><P>The source of division begins with the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Our forefather Adam was seduced by Satan to eat from that tree (Gen. 3:1-6). As a result, the element of sin was injected into his body. When the element of sin entered into man, man began to live according to his fallen flesh and eventually became flesh (6:3). At Babel the one mankind created by God rebelled against God and became divided into different nations (11:1-9). Adam ate from the tree of knowledge, and the result was that man became flesh. Ultimately, this flesh brought in division among mankind. Galatians 5:20 lists divisions among the works of the flesh. Therefore, divisions are of the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Divisions Being Not Only of the Flesh<br>but Also according to the Manner of Man</H2><P>Divisions are not only of the flesh but also according to the manner of man. In 1 Corinthians 3:3, in dealing with the problem of divisions among the Corinthians, the apostle Paul told the Corinthian believers that they were still fleshly and were walking according to the manner of man. Since every fallen man is just the flesh (Rom. 3:20; Gal. 2:16), the manner of man is to be according to the flesh. Man's living, man's expression, is just an expression of the flesh. Whatever man lives is just his fallen flesh. To be according to the flesh is to walk not according to God but according to the manner of man. The result of such a walk is division.</P><P>Wherever division exists, the works of the flesh are manifested. According to Galatians 5:19-21 these works include enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, and sects (schools of opinion). If we are involved with division, we will be visited by all these kinds of things. In the recent turmoil in the Lord's recovery, many of these things were manifested by the divisive ones. Some brothers were filled with anger and hatred toward their fellow members in the Body. This was the living out of the flesh. Ultimately, these manifestations of the flesh issued in division.</P><P>The way to be kept from division is to receive the Triune God as the tree of life. This will preserve us in oneness. We also need to be on guard to reject all kinds of division. We need to see that God has made a great provision for the flesh, and that is the cross. The cross deals with the flesh of man. One of the ingredients in the all-inclusive, compound, and consummated Spirit is the effectiveness of the cross. A picture in the Old Testament of the cross's dealing with the flesh is circumcision. Circumcision is the cutting away of the flesh. The cross is the reality of circumcision (Col. 2:11). In order to experience this reality, we need to exercise to be fully in the mingled spirit so that the flesh will be cut off (Rom. 8:13; Gal. 5:24). When the flesh is dealt with through the cross, all the germs of division are killed.</P>
