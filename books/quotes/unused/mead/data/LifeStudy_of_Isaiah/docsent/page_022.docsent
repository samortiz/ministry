   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ISSUING IN THE RESTORATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE NATION OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's judgment on the haughty nations ushers in the God-man, Christ 4:2, 5-6 , issuing in the restoration of the nation of Israel 4:3-6; 2:2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. The Ushering In of the God-man, Christ 1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"In That Day"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to 4:2, the ushering in of Christ will be "in that day," that is, in the day of the coming restoration of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Shoot of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>and the Fruit of the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 4:2 there are two striking expressions: the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two are one pair, illustrating Christ's two natures: the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Shoot of Jehovah refers to Christ's deity, showing His divine nature, and the Fruit of the earth Luke 1:42 refers to Christ's humanity with His human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the Shoot of Jehovah, Christ comes out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the Fruit of the earth, Christ, having a human body made of dust, grows out of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the book of Isaiah, Christ is unveiled as the God-man, the Shoot of Jehovah with beauty and glory and the Fruit of the earth with excellence and splendor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the restoration, to those of Israel who have escaped, Christ in His deity will be beauty and glory, and in His humanity He will be excellence and splendor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Shoot of Jehovah denotes that Christ is a new development of Jehovah God for the Triune God to branch out Himself in His divinity into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is for Jehovah God's increase and spread in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Fruit of the earth denotes that Christ, as the divine Shoot of Jehovah, also becomes a man of flesh from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is for the Triune God to be multiplied and reproduced in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a man with the divine life, He is a seed, a grain of wheat, to produce many grains through His death and resurrection John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a God-man, Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth, is ushered in by God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In particular, He is ushered in by war, which is used by God to judge the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more war there is, the more Christ will be ushered in. Many believers can testify that they were saved during a time of war.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Out of the Christ who is ushered in by judgment issues the restoration of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, God's judgment eventually results in Christ, the God-man, with restoration.</S>
