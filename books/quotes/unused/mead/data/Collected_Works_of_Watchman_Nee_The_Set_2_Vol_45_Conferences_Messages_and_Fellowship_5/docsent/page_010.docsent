   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-ONE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NATURAL LIFE, THE OLD MAN, AND THE FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT Date: 1940</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Unrecorded</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: Gal 4:19; 5:22-23; Heb 12:5-7, 9-11; 1 Cor 3:12, 14; 7:10, 17, 25; 11:11; Gen 2:12; Matt 28:19; 2 Thes 3:5; Phil 4:11-12; 1 Pet 1:6-7</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For a new believer there is very little difference between the natural life and the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The natural life is the life that is created by God, while the old man is man's life after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before Adam sinned, he had the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After he sinned, he had the life of the old man in addition to the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every person has the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only wooden statues do not have the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But since man sinned, he not only has the natural life, but also the life of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ also had the natural life, but He did not have the life of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, although Christ had the natural life, He did not live by it, but by the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A believer needs to be dealt with in two areas: in his natural life and in the life of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The life of the old man has been dealt with in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now he needs to deal with the natural life, that is, the life that tries to do good and practice morality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians 3:12 shows us that man's work in the eyes of God is of two kinds.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One is the work of gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Gold and silver are minerals, while precious stones are a kind of compound.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of them are buried in the ground for a long time, and all of them need to go through a process of cutting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The other is the work of wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the work of the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Jacob's experience shows us that the natural life is something that must be dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although Jacob had the right goal, he employed the wrong means.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His goal was to have God's blessing, but he tried to acquire it by exercising his natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the end God had to step in to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is a difference between sanctification in 1 Corinthians 1:30 and holiness in Hebrews 12:10.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The former refers to Christ as sanctification to the believers, while the latter refers to the holiness wrought in the believers through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The latter is produced through discipline and constituted in the believers through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The result of this discipline is the fruit of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This fruit is not manufactured, but grown.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All fruit grows in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no need for a fruit tree to exert any effort to produce fruit; it bears fruit spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same way the fruit of the Holy Spirit is the result of the indwelling Christ being assimilated and produced by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's intention is not only for the believers to have Christ as their life, but for them to bear the fruit of Christ in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A believer's reward in Christ is His living within the believers and living on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what Paul meant when he spoke about Christ being formed in the believers in Galatians 4:19.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through the Holy Spirit, Christ is wrought into the believers to the extent that for them to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let me mention something about George Cutting the author of Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I was in England, I went to pray with him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time he was over ninety years old already.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He prayed repeatedly: "Christ cannot be without me, and I cannot be without Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He went on: "This is our living in union with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His living was one which lived Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only those who have never experienced the Lord's dealing would be so presumptuous as to say, "If all will be stumbled because of You, I will never be stumbled" Matt 26:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But some parts of the Bible are also the words of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many words in 1 Corinthians 7 are the words of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because the Lord was formed in Paul, and because for Paul to live was Christ, his speaking became God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to reach this stage, a believer's natural life must be dealt with thoroughly.</S>
