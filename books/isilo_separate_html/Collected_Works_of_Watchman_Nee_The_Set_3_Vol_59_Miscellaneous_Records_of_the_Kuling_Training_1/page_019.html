First, there is the Roman Catholic Church. It claims to be a direct descendant of the apostle Peter, and it does not admit that the church is desolate. Second, there are the Brethren, with Darby as their representative. He was the only one who dared to stand up to declare the desolate state of the church. Yet he himself was a proof that the church was not altogether desolate. Third, there are the Congregationalists who consider the local assembly to be the basic sphere of all activities. They do not see the church at large. For them there is not an issue over Protestantism or Catholicism but over church rule, which is based on the decision of the local congregation. Fourth, there are those who have adopted a system of bishops. They base their practice on the book of Timothy, in which Timothy was appointed by Paul to be an overseer, or bishop, over the elders. They regard a bishop as a chief elder. The chairman among the elders is the bishop, who is supposed to inherit all of the apostles' authority. From this practice comes the ordination of many pastors. These ones do not realize that the Bible considers elders and overseers (or bishops) as being the same group of people. Fifth, there are the Presbyterians. They say that the apostolic age is over, since the biblical apostles are all dead. However, they believe that we still have elders. Those who are ministering at the present time are the elders. This group does not believe in the desolation of the church either. Of the five groups, Catholicism is at one extreme, being completely autocratic, and the Brethren are at the other extreme, being completely democratic. The other three groups lie between Catholicism and Brethrenism. From each of these five groups many minor groups and sects have developed. When brothers like Darby were raised up, they had wonderful testimonies concerning church truth. Since the time of the apostle Paul, no other servant of God was as deeply acquainted with God's gospel as Darby. He was a unique example of someone who is not in desolation. In fact, he was a proof of advancement.</p><p>When the Lord was still on earth, He prophesied that the temple would be destroyed by Roman soldiers. In the apostles' time the Jewish religion was still very strong. There was a physical temple and the animal sacrifices. Even when Paul the apostle went up to Jerusalem, he tried to fulfill his vow by making offerings in the temple. This mixture of spiritual and material worship confused the believers. The Lord had to commit these material things to the destruction of the Romans. It was a blessing to us that the Romans destroyed the temple. Except for this destruction we would still be going up to Jerusalem to worship our God. Man likes to lay hold of material things, such as the temple, the altar, the priests, etc. He does not like to lay hold of spiritual things. If the temple, the altar, and the priests were still with us today, believers would turn back to Judaism easily. This is the reason the Roman soldiers had to destroy the temple, remove the altar, and annul the priesthood. This was the only way to consolidate the foundation of the church of Christ. Yet Catholicism brought some of the Judaistic elements back into Christianity. Among Christians today there are still such external elements as Buddhistic asceticism and humanistic moral and ethical practices. Those who practice these things are like the Christians of the apostolic age, who cleaved to the temple, the priests, the altar, and the offerings. On the one hand, they held dearly to the Old Testament law of Moses and the blood of the animals, and on the other hand, they would not let go of the New Testament teaching of the apostles and the precious blood of Christ the Lamb. Today the foundation of the church of Christ is more sure and solid than before. Yet the power that was with the church is missing.</p><p>In the light of the recovery of God's church today, we can say that there is an advance in the truth of the gospel. Yet we must admit that the persons preaching such a gospel are still not right. This is the reason the effect of the gospel is not as strong as it was in the age of the apostles. The church is advancing, and we should not try to turn back. There are two kinds of riches before us today. One is the riches of the recovery, and the other is the riches of the advancement of the church throughout the past nearly two thousand years. We cannot ignore these two kinds of riches. The fact that the gospel is not as effective as it was at the time of Pentecost is a problem that has to do with the church itself. We should not preach a gospel that will leave the next generation with much work to finish. If the Lord is to come back soon, nothing more needs to be said. However, if He delays, the next generation will say that they are doing the same thing that the previous generation did. The way the next generation turns out depends on the way we receive our commission from the Lord. Therefore, our recovery must be absolute. The way must be absolute, and whatever we do must be done in an absolute way. We have to be the church of Christ, one that rids itself of all influence of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Judaism.</p><p>It is not hard for a man to give up all his possessions, but it is hard for a man to give up himself. It is still harder for a man to be broken in his outer man so that God can have a free way through him. Today the demand is very high. We need to submit to authority, and we need to give ourselves to coordination. In order to obey authority and to coordinate with others, we have to be on the alert before God every step of the way. We have to clearly see what the New Testament church is. Everything depends on the amount of breaking we experience. We can only pray for Christ's desire. These are solemn days. May we go through thorough dealings with the Lord so that we can serve Him in a thorough way.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
