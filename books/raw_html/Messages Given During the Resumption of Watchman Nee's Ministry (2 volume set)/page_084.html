<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ON BEING A PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TALKS (13)</H1><P>Date:Evening, January 24, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VAIN DOCTRINES AND PRACTICAL WAYS</H2><P>Today, what many people receive is but doctrines. These doctrines do not render much benefit to the practical Christian living. Many spiritual terminologies are but terms only. For example, to say that a certain person is fleshly or spiritual is but empty spiritual terms to some people. The foreigners spread the gospel to the East, but what many of them preached was but doctrines. In the end, the ones who preached gave nothing but doctrines, and the ones who listened heard nothing but doctrines, and neither knew what the words spoken meant. This is like some people who have never seen snow, yet they keep talking about snow. The pastors in Christianity study in the seminaries and pick up a lot of doctrines. For example, one pastor has a wonderful plan; he has prepared fifty-two sermons, one for each week of the year. With this preparation, he has no fear of running out of sermons. This serves well for his congregation also, who think that by doing this, they will not be out of food or lacking in sermons all year round. But this kind of listening will only make a person big in his head. Today, many people know only the terms and have no idea what they really mean. The reason for this is that they have never properly experienced the things themselves.</P><P>What is to love the Lord? What is to be humble? What is to follow the Lord? What is it for God to be glorified? What is to be led? And what is to love the brothers? I am not here trying to give you a hard time. I am not asking if you understand these doctrines. It is easy to understand the doctrine of love. As long as a person takes a cross-reference Bible, he can prepare a message on loving the Lord. But he does not necessarily have the thing "love" itself. This is the condition of Christianity today. In Christianity everybody says what everybody else is saying, and men only pay attention to the study of doctrines and the attendance of Sunday worship services.</P><P>What is humility? Is it to hold the Bible in your arm and to walk slowly, looking at heaven every few steps? Is this humility? This kind of behavior is false humility. When people who behave this way lose their temper, they will yell and bang on the tables. We should not merely be those who come to attend worship services or to listen to sermons. We need to have fellowship with the brothers and sisters. Today the flavor of Christianity is too strong among us. When someone comes to our city, we hope to receive some help, and we expect the visitor to come with an abundance of grace. But I can hardly believe that a person can receive any help under such circumstances. If you receive any help, it is some other kind of help; what you have received is but beautiful thoughts. Some Christians have large heads, small bodies, and almost no legs. Some saints are experts in criticizing others. They are good at listening to messages. They are good at reading books, and they like to listen to famous speakers. They are like the professional opera-goers. This kind of people is terrible. Sooner or later, they will become tired of listening to messages or of attending services. I am speaking contrary words today. I do not expect you to understand my words. On the contrary, I expect you not to understand my words. Today it is not a question of understanding or not understanding. Today it is a question of whether or not we are willing to be a practical Christian.</P><P>Christianity today is filled with fallen conditions. Here we need a real revolution, a revolution that revolutionizes a person. In a group of seven or eight hundred people, how many are there who are serious about going on? Many people like to attend revival meetings. But the question is this: Will these meetings help a person to go on in the way of following the Lord? I do not like people coming to me telling me that they have received help from me. I do not know you that well. If I did, I would ask you, "What kind of help have you received? Did you receive help from me in expounding the Bible? Or did you receive help from me in knowing the doctrines?" Doctrines will only give people something to talk about. There is a difference between doctrine and a way. A way affords a person a path to follow, whereas doctrines can only afford a person something to listen to and to talk about. I am not here helping you to know more about doctrines or to have a bigger head. Do not ask me how a portion of the Scripture should be interpreted. We need to be a practical person, living a practical life. In Shanghai some young people came to me and asked me about the second coming of Christ. I told them that whether or not the Lord will come soon is not their concern. What they have to do is to preach the gospel and to learn to love the Lord more.</P>
