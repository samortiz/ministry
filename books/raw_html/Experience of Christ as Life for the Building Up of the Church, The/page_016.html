<P>Many of you have been faithful to the church life and are sincere to practice the church life. This is why I have the burden to share with you that the proper way to practice the church life is not by doctrines, forms, or gifts. It is by the flowing of the Triune God within us. The more He flows within us and through us, the more we will be transformed in our nature, our disposition, our very being, and the more we will be built up. This is the way to have the church life. Do not trust in doctrines or gifts. The Corinthian believers practiced the gifts, but the apostle Paul told them that they were fleshy. They spoke in tongues, but they were infants in Christ (1 Cor. 3:1). They were fleshy and soulish, so there were divisions among them (11:18-19). They did not have the building.</P><P>This shows that what we need is the flowing of the Triune God, the flowing of life. This is our burden. We should care only for the flowing of the inner life. This inner life is the Triune God as the Father who planned and purposed everything; as the Son who has accomplished everything, obtained everything, and attained to the highest place; and as the Spirit who is transmitting all that the Son is and has with the Father into us. It is a wrong concept to think that if we are properly instructed, corrected, and adjusted, we will be able to have the church life. This will not work. The only thing you and I need is the flowing of the inner life, the flowing of the Triune God.</P><P>This flowing of the living water within us is in our spirit. It is not in our mind, our opinions, our ideas, or our concepts. It is not in our emotion or will. It is absolutely, entirely, wholly, and fully in our spirit. The subtle enemy knows that this is the key point. This is why he tries to cover this matter and keep it hidden from the eyes of Christians. The human spirit, regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit, is mentioned repeatedly throughout the Bible, but there is very little said about it today (see the book entitled Our Human Spirit published by Living Stream Ministry). Today the need is not for us to be taught, instructed, and corrected. The need today is for us to realize that the Triune God who planned and purposed in the Father and who accomplished what He purposed in the Son is now transmitting Himself into us as the Spirit to be our life. Now this Wonderful One in three persons is indwelling the deepest part of our being, that is, our human spirit.</P><P>By His flowing within our spirit, the church life comes into being. By His flowing within us, we are transformed day by day. We are not for outward instruction and correction. The inner flow of the Triune God takes care of everything. If you could be successful in adjusting yourself, you would become so proud. But it is not like this in the Christian life. Everything is carried out by the flow of the inner life. We should not be concerned so much about the saints' outward appearance or even their bad attitudes. Christ is the anointed One of God who is working within them to transform them. Instead of adjusting or correcting people, we need to bring them into the inner flowing of the Triune God.</P><P>The more the Triune God as the inner life flows within us, the more our whole being will be saturated with Him. By this life saturation little by little, day by day, and hour by hour, our mind is transformed, our will is subdued, and our emotions are purified. We are transformed by the inner flowing of the Triune God. How good it is to have the inner flowing!</P>
