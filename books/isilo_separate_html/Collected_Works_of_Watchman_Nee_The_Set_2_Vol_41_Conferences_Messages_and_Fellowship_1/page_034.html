This means from faith to faith. "Out of faith" is one thing and "to faith" is another thing. It is one thing to go from Amoy to Chuenchow, and it is another thing to go from Chuenchow to Amoy. A prayer that issues out of faith is one thing, and a prayer that results in faith is another thing. "Out of faith" means that faith is the starting point. "To faith" means that faith is the goal. Only faith can produce a work of faith; no work can produce faith.</p><p>Suppose a sick brother has received a promise that God will heal him. He begins to praise the Lord, and the Lord heals him in two days. After this, he testifies about it. From this we see that there are seven steps to healing by faith: (1) sickness, (2) prayer, (3) receiving a promise, (4) believing in the promise, (5) praise, (6) healing, and (7) testifying. If another brother tried to do the first five steps but could not experience the sixth, what would be the reason? The first brother believed that his sickness was going to be healed and then praised. His praise issued from his faith, whereas the second brother praised in order to reach the goal of faith. He regarded praise as the means to arrive at faith. The first brother's praise was a result, whereas the second brother's praise was a means. The second brother hoped to be healed through praising. He did not have genuine faith. Therefore, it did not work. We can only praise because of faith, not in order to produce faith.</p><p>Once I was very sick. The Lord promised that I would live by faith, stand by faith, and walk by faith. When God spoke to me, I believed His word and prayed no more. I believed in God's promise for my living, standing, and walking. As a result, I lived, stood, and walked. Later, another sister became sick, and she tried to duplicate my experience. She tried to make herself strong, but she could not do it. She wanted to work herself to a position of faith, but this was impossible. She did not have any faith, yet she wanted to produce faith. This will never work. The experience of faith is based on the Lord's promises, and praise issues from faith. One does not experience faith by copying someone else's act of faith, and one cannot praise himself into faith. One can copy formulas of faith; however, formulas are useless. Only living faith will produce results.</p><h2 class="head1">FAITH BEING FOLLOWED<br />BY VISIONS AND REVELATIONS</h2><p>When I was in Shanghai, I spoke on the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. I said that first there is faith, and then there is praise. A man must first have faith before he can have the work of faith, which is praise. Praise is not the means by which we reach faith. Trying to reach faith by practicing the work of faith, that is, through praises, will not work. When we talk about the assurance of salvation, we can render either help or damage to people. Some nominal Christians in the denominations are not yet regenerated. When they hear a word on the assurance of salvation, they are relieved to know that they are no longer bound for hell. Faith, however, must be accompanied by visions and revelations. The Bible does not say that faith is receiving, but it does say that faith can receive. Receiving is a function of faith. Faith can appropriate, but appropriation is not necessarily faith. For example, a man can walk, but this does not mean that anything that can walk is a man. Faith must be accompanied by visions and revelations. One cannot take someone else's visions and revelations and make them his own faith. Faith must be built upon one's own visions and revelations.</p><h2 class="head1">FAITH BEING THE ORGAN<br />TO SUBSTANTIATE SPIRITUAL THINGS</h2><p>Hebrews 11:1 says, "Now faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen." This verse gives us the definition of faith. Faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, in the same way that our five senses substantiate the things that are outside of us. The eyes are related to colors and shapes; they substantiate the color and shape of objects. A blind man does not know anything about the colors in the world or the shape of objects. There are, no doubt, objects in the world, but a blind man cannot see them with his eyes. There is no seeing organ to substantiate color and shape for him. A blind man's world does not have any color. Today the eyes of our faith need to be opened to see visions and revelations. When they are opened, we will substantiate spiritual things.</p><p>God's Word shows us that the Lord is the vine and that we are the branches. This is a fact that will never change. But if we lack the organ to see this vision, we will not experience this reality. God's facts will not change whether or not we believe. Our unbelief cannot change God's view, but if we believe in these facts, we will enjoy what God has prepared for us. In the spiritual realm, a person enters into the enjoyment once he sees. When a person opens his eyes, he will see the scenery before him. If he does not open his eyes, the scenery will still be there, but he will not be able to enjoy it. We know that our old man is evil; we cannot change him, and it is impossible to chase him out. However, if a man comes into God's presence, and if he sees what God sees, he will realize that in the eyes of God his old man is crucified. He will immediately be released and everything will be done for him. God's facts do not change, whether we see them or not. Whether or not we see, we are crucified already. In God's eyes this is a fact. The Bible records what God sees. The Bible records all the wonderful "colors" and "shapes" of the spiritual things. The Bible is like a spiritual art gallery. When we read the Bible to a person who is spiritually blind, and when he opens his eyes of faith, he will see what God sees, and every word and letter of the Bible will become real to him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> </body></html>
