   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 1 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matt1:1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 And Judah begot Pharez and Zarah of Tamar</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6 And Jesse begot David the king.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>16 And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Gal 3:14 In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we come to the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jesus is the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The generation of Christ is composed of first, the fathers the forefathers, the great persons; second, the kings, the royalty and, third, the civilians the captured ones and the recovered ones .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His generation not only includes the high-ranking people, but also the civilians, the insignificant ones, like Mary and Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The poor people, the little people, are also included in the generation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This generation includes both the called ones, like Abraham, and the ones carried away to captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This generation includes Jeconiah, a king who was dethroned and deported to Babylon as a captive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Have you ever been dethroned?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not think you have not.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In your Christian life you sometimes have been dethroned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once you were a king, but you lost your kingship and became a backslider.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After captivity there was the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, we have another name, Zerubbabel, the name of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You were an Abraham, you became a Jeconiah, but today you are a Zerubbabel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are all Zerubbabels.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are the called ones, the fallen ones, and the recovered ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Jewish custom, a writer of a genealogy would never include a female name; he would include only the names of males.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in this brief genealogy five women are mentioned: Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, her who had been the wife of Uriah, and Mary .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Four of these five women were remarried, and one of the four was a harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why does this brief record mention all these women?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is because they are our representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not think you are more pure than these women.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are worse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the worst ones are included in the generation of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is truly the Savior of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we were to write a biography of Christ we would hide all these impure grandmothers and give the names of the good grandmothers, such as Sarah and Rebekah.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the Holy Spirit did not mention all the good ones; however, He purposely included these impure ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Besides the four remarried women, a virgin stands out: Mary, the mother of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Mary was good, pure, and clean.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that everyone mentioned in this book of generation is a sinner except Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This book of generation says that Christ is the son of David and the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the son of David, He is for the Jews; as the son of Abraham, He is for us all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All nations are blessed in Abraham's seed, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This blessing is the participation in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The blessing which God promised to Abraham was the Spirit Gal 3:14 , and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By Christ as the son of Abraham, we have the Spirit, and we share in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hallelujah!</S>
