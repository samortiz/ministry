   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-THREE EXPERIENCING THE RICHES OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 3:8b, 17a; 2 Cor 2:10; 10:1; 11:10; 8:9; 12:9; 13:14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 3:8 speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ, and 3:17, of Christ making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that the very Christ who is making His home in us is the Christ with the unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The unsearchable riches of Christ are for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Day by day and even hour by hour we need to enjoy these marvelous, wonderful, immeasurable, unlimited, and all-inclusive riches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is difficult to list all the items of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If these items were few in number, it would be easy for us to point them out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But Christ s riches are beyond our ability to speak of them or to enumerate them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to get into the riches of Christ in Ephesians, it will be helpful to consider Paul s experience of these riches as revealed in the book of 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>GIFTS, GRACE, AND TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book of 2 Corinthians deals with grace, in contrast to 1 Corinthians, which deals with gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul concludes 2 Corinthians with the words, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all 13:14, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>. Because 2 Corinthians is a book of grace, in the concluding verse Paul mentions grace first.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Grace is deeper and more subjective than gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gifts are outward, but grace is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, gifts are related to what we do, but grace is related to inward enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is significant that it is in 2 Corinthians, not in 1 Corinthians, that Paul says that we are transformed as we behold the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be gifted is one thing, but to be transformed is another.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although many Christians pay attention to gifts, not many concentrate on transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you prefer to be gifted or to be transformed?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before you answer this question, consider the example of Balaam s donkey Num 22:23-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suddenly this donkey spoke to Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How miraculous for a donkey to speak a human language!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the donkey was not transformed into a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There was the gift of speaking, but there was not any transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Transformation takes place slowly through the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It transpires so slowly that it may seem as if nothing is happening.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, to a mother, her young child may look the same every day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, the child is gradually growing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 2 Corinthians 4:7 Paul says, But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The treasure in the earthen vessels does not refer to gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, it denotes something precious that is hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The vessel is outward, but the treasure is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through the process of transformation over a period of time, the treasure takes over the vessel and swallows it up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another difference between 2 Corinthians and 1 Corinthians is that 2 Corinthians speaks a great deal about suffering, but there is no need for suffering in order to have spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was not necessary for Balaam s donkey to suffer to have the ability to speak a human language.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Transformation, on the contrary, requires a certain amount of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason, 2 Corinthians speaks not only of the grace of Christ, but also of the sufferings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 2 Corinthians 1:5 Paul says that the sufferings of Christ abound in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The grace of Christ with the sufferings of Christ produces transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Transformation is not a matter of our gifts or abilities; it is a matter of what we are in our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 2 Corinthians 4:5 Paul declared, For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although Paul did not preach himself or write an autobiography, occasionally he found it necessary to disclose certain aspects of his experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 2 Corinthians there are a number of such disclosures by which we can see how Paul enjoyed particular aspects of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later on in this message we shall consider these particular aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Certain aspects of the riches of Christ are very great.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some of these are the fact that Christ is God, the Creator, the Son of God, the Redeemer, the Savior, the Father, and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Other major aspects are related to incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descension, and indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, there are the aspects of Christ as life, love, power, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All these are great items, and, to some degree at least.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christians do know them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, Christians may have just a doctrinal knowledge of these riches of Christ without the experience of them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may not only know the various aspects of the riches of Christ, but also experience them and enjoy them.</S>
