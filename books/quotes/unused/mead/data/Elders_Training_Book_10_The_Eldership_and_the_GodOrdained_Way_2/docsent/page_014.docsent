   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Since October 1984, I have been burdened to study the need in the Lord's recovery according to the situation that was present among us at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank the Lord that He has given me the environment, the time, the energy, and everything that was needed for me to remain in that study for these five years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And I thank Him even more that through this long period of study the Lord has shown me the God-ordained way to serve and work for Him, as revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This implies also the scriptural way to preach the gospel and to meet as Christians, as the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This kind of realization has surely made me clear about the direction of the Lord's move today on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>OUR GOD IS LIVING, OUR LORD IS MOVING,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>AND THE SPIRIT IS WORKING</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning the direction of the Lord's move today, I fully believe that our God is living 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 3:12 , that our Lord is moving Matt 16:18 , and that the Spirit is working Rev 5:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since our God is living, our Lord is moving, and the Spirit is working, our Triune God must still be carrying on His unique work for the accomplishing of His eternal economy, just as He has worked for this in the past ages and centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we need to find out what our living, moving, and working God is doing today on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is He carrying on today on this earth to complete His work for His eternal economy, that is, to build up the organic Body of His Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all need to know what the Lord's move is today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE LORD'S MOVE TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord's move today is to recover the God-ordained way revealed in the New Testament in four steps:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1 To recover the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not merely to preach the gospel, but to handle the gospel as a priest, as Paul did Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter in his first Epistle, in 2:5 and 9, also referred to this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He told us that we are being built up into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God, and that as such a priesthood we should tell out the virtues of God, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To tell out the virtues of God, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light, is to preach the gospel, telling people how God has saved us out of darkness into His marvelous light through His virtues, such as His mercy, His grace, His forgiveness, His washing away of our sins, His justification, and His regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To offer up spiritual sacrifices to God is to bring the saved sinners as sacrifices for us to offer to our God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Old Testament what was offered were the types of Christ, but today what should be offered are the saved ones, who have become the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The priests in the Old Testament offered types of Christ Himself, but today we offer saved sinners as parts of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, in Romans 12:1 Paul said that we need to present our bodies to God as living sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not go out merely to win souls.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not go out only to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We go out to fulfill our New Testament priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we go out, we should have the realization that we are priests, priests of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This matter must be recovered.</S>
