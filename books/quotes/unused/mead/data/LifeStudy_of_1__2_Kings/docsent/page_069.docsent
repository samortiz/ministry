   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE REIGN OF JEHU OVER ISRAEL Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 8:16 10:36</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have strongly pointed out that the Old Testament history is very much related to God's economy in the way of typology.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we read the books of history in the Old Testament without knowing the typology, we will not understand these books.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 2 Kings two persons Elisha and Jezebel are striking types of certain real things in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whereas Elisha was a very sweet person, Jezebel was most evil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this message on the reigns of Jehoram and Ahaziah over Judah and the reign of Jehu over Israel, we will see the destruction of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both the Old Testament in typology and the New Testament in fulfillment speak of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The evil of Jezebel, a most hateful person, is like the evil of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people have been poisoned, cheated, veiled, and usurped by her.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Jezebel of the Old Testament was a type and a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is important for us to see who Jezebel is in the New Testament reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jezebel, the pagan wife of Ahab, is a type of the apostate church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christianity is the biggest religion on earth, and the greatest part of this religion is today's Jezebel, the apostate Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Revelation 2:24 the Lord Jesus said that Jezebel teaches the "deep things of Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Matthew 13:33 this same woman mixed leaven, the element of Satan, with fine flour, which signifies the Lord Jesus as the meal offering for the satisfaction of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jezebel, the apostate church, teaches the deity of Christ but has mixed much leaven with the teaching of the divine person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With Jezebel, therefore, there is one part truth and many parts leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Vast regions of the earth are under her influence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Revelation 17 this woman is the great harlot who mixes abominations with the divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us now turn to 2 Kings 8:16 10:36 to see what is recorded here concerning Jehoram, Ahaziah, Jehu, and Jezebel.</S>
