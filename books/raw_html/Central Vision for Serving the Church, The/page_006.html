        <h2 class="head2">Strong Personality and Natural Ability<br />
Closing the Door to Revelation</h2>
<p>Some people have a very strong personality. A person who has a strong personality will not do something unless he is given responsibility for it. Such persons are naturally able and are capable of exerting influence with their strong personality. If the church is placed into their hands, the door for revelation often is closed. If the leading ones are open to the Lord, they and the saints will receive light and revelation. If, however, the leading ones are not open, the saints will not receive revelation even if they have a heart. A flock always follows the head sheep; the head sheep determines how the other sheep follow. Once the leading ones go astray, it is difficult for the flock not to go astray as well. This will stop the shining of light. Some leading ones have a natural ability to work things out; however, the church is the Body, and the Body depends upon the coordination of the members. Even if we are able to work things out, everything does not have to be decided by us. We must look to the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that our strong personality would be subdued. Otherwise, we will close the door to revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Social Skills and Diplomacy<br />
Closing the Door to Revelation</h2>
<p>Other people bring their social skills and diplomacy into the church; they cultivate friendships, develop relationships, and connect with one another. This also closes the door to revelation, and it has no place in the church. There should be healthy fellowship in the church but not social connections or acceptance of others based on social approval. It is a shame for social skills to be utilized in the church. We should sustain one another, but a social &ldquo;endorsement&rdquo; of others is a shame.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RETURNING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>These conditions are present in the church because of our natural humanity. Their presence, however, also indicates that we have strayed from our spirit. For this we need to accept the cross, but more accurately, we need to return to our spirit. If we &ldquo;accept the cross&rdquo; without returning to our spirit, our acceptance is merely an expression of human cultivation. When we return to our spirit, there is no ground for our self. In other words, our flesh, our human affections, and our old ways are terminated when we return to our spirit.</p>
<p>Our problem today is that we lack the spirit, and because we lack the spirit, we lack revelation. If we are not in our spirit, we will bring our knowledge and old ways into the church. A wax figure is not a human being, because there is no life in it. Life is the most important matter. A loud and fast prayer is not an indication that our spirit has been released. Instead, the release of our spirit depends upon whether we are in our spirit. People who have a strong personality and who are skillful in exercising diplomacy often do not release much of the spirit in their prayers in the meetings. In fact, those who exercise diplomacy often do not pray, and when they do pray, it often comes from the mind.</p>
<p>Being in the spirit is not something that can be feigned, imitated, or hidden. When the church is truly in the spirit, the Spirit is manifested in a clear way, and it is quite exposing. The Spirit exposes us when we open our mouth as well as when we shut it. The Spirit exposes us when we move as well as when we are still. In contrast, a fleshly person is still fleshly whether or not he loses his temper. As long as we are not in our spirit, our fleshly nature is manifest. A loose person manifests a loose nature, an able person manifests his ability, and a diplomatic person manifests his ability to connect with and win over people. However, once we return to our spirit, none of these things have any ground. We should never value a person&rsquo;s outward performance. It may be useful in society, but it is useless in the church. We need to be genuine and to be in our spirit in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">POSITION-SEEKING IN THE CHURCH BEING IN DARKNESS</h2>
<p>Years ago I did not know or believe that people would seek for position in the church. Over the years, however, I have discovered that such a desire is always present in us. For example, if a sister is asked to serve as a deaconess, another sister will complain that she was not asked as well. In the brothers&rsquo; fellowship concerning the appointment of elders, there are often ones who say, &ldquo;It will not be good if we make this brother an elder but not that brother.&rdquo; Such a thought is quite low. If this is truly the case, then neither brother should be an elder. Anyone who talks about position is not qualified to be an elder.</p>
<p>I went to Shanghai for the first time in October 1933, and I was a guest in Brother Nee&rsquo;s home for four months. Then the Lord led me to move my whole family to Shanghai to labor with Brother Nee. There were many things that I did not know related to the church in Shanghai, but Brother Nee still made me responsible for speaking in the meetings. At that time, there was a very active and aggressive brother who appeared to love the Lord very much. One afternoon this brother came and asked me if he could speak from the podium in the afternoon meeting, so I gave him an opportunity to speak. When Brother Nee learned about this, he spoke a serious word to me concerning not letting this brother give any messages. Later, I learned that this brother had had a desire to be an elder from the time that he came into the church life.</p>
<p>Brother Nee said that whoever wants to an elder should not be an elder. Brother Nee practiced this, and he would not let this brother be an elder. He was very strict in this matter. When I went to Shanghai in 1948, this brother was still not an elder. At the end of 1948, he started another meeting in his home and hired a freelance preacher. The freelance preacher later wrote a book attacking Brother Nee. If we have a hidden desire for position in the church, we will be in darkness and not have any light or revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REPENTING TO THE LORD FOR NOT LIVING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Because of these negative conditions, we have no light and revelation. Whether we are co-workers or elders, we must be subdued before the Lord and must humble ourselves when we gather together from our various localities. These negative conditions should not be present in the church. We must be in our spirit in the church. There is no place for us in the church apart from being in our spirit. If we are not in our spirit, we are finished in the church. No amount of human striving and struggling will produce favorable results. Being in spirit is the only way in the church. Eloquence, thoughtfulness, and knowledge are useless. Only being in the spirit is useful in the church. Once we return to our spirit, there will be an Amen in the spirit of all the saints.</p>
<p>If we know how to speak but have no spirit, the more we speak, the more the saints will be quiet, and the more we move, the less the saints will say Amen. As long as we neglect the spirit, the light will fade like the setting sun, like a dying lamp. The elders have paid much attention to administration, methods, and arrangements but not to the spirit or to supplying the saints in the spirit. In principle, this is the same with the brothers and sisters. The speaking from the podium is not focused on the spirit, the meetings are not focused on the spirit, and our prayers are not focused on the spirit. Instead, we are focused on diplomacy, practices, knowledge, and being clever. Our spirit is lacking in function, and there is little light.</p>
<p>If the Spirit does not get through, the Lord will not be present, and if the Lord is not present, we have nothing. We have no light, no life, and no revelation because we have no spirit. It is not enough for us to hate sin; we must hate not being in our spirit. Man sins, falls, casts off restraint, and maneuvers for position because he is not in the spirit. Once man returns to the spirit, he no longer strives for position, and he even tires of position and considers it a hindrance to his living in the spirit.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would not only repent for our sins but also for not living in our spirit. Not living in our spirit is a great offense to the Lord. If we are not in our spirit, we will not have revelation or light, the church will not have increase, and the work will produce only problems. We must hate that we care only for our self and our convenience and not for our spirit. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
