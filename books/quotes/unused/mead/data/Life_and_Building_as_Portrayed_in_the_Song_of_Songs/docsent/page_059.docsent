   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOVE AS STRONG AS DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following the Lord's answer, the seeking one prays a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do believe that none of us has ever heard such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as Sheol" 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know that the heart signifies love, and the arm signifies power and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore this prayer indicates that she does not have any confidence in herself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She trusts in the Lord's loving heart and the Lord's mighty arm.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She is praying in this way, "O Lord, keep me in Your loving heart and preserve me by Your mighty arm.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have no trust in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though I am so matured, yet I am still in this flesh while I am going out of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without Your keeping power and Your preserving love, I still may fall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So, Lord, keep me as a seal on Your heart and on Your arm."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This prayer indicates that she still realizes she is not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She has no trust in herself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What a prayer this is!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She is such a mature one, and yet she does not have any self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Her trust is fully in the Lord's love and might.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In her prayer, the seeking one says that the love of the Lord is as strong as death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most Christians do not like to use a negative term to illustrate something of the Lord, as the Bible does here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we had written the Bible, we would never have used the term "thief" to describe the Lord when He comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only good things, but also some negative things illustrate the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How negative death is!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet there is nothing that describes the strength of the Lord's love as death does.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Death is the strongest power in the universe, outside of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When death visits a person, nothing can reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot tell death that we are too busy and to wait for another three years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Praise the Lord, His love is as strong as death!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the love of the Lord touches us, we cannot say that we are too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His love will simply capture us!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the seekers of the Lord Jesus have been captured by His love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is as strong as death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>JEALOUSY AS CRUEL AS SHEOL</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then she says that the Lord's jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sheol is the Hebrew equivalent of the Greek word Hades, where the dead are kept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sheol is not the consummation of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The consummation of hell will be the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But before that consummation, there is a place in this universe called Sheol that holds the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nothing is as cruel as Sheol; it receives the dead without mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Though you love your dear wife, if Sheol comes to take her away from you, it has no mercy; it is so cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This describes the jealousy of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is not only a loving God, but also a jealous God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Deuteronomy 4:24 says, "For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that we have no trust in ourselves or in what we can be.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we ask the Lord to put us as a seal on His heart and on His arm.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We put our trust in His love and strength, for His love is as strong as death and very jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He would not allow our loved ones or anything else to keep us from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His jealousy is as Sheol.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should never trust in our love; our love is not trustworthy, and our love is not strong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our love is always merciful and not so jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we depend upon our love, two tears from our wife will turn us aside.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the love of Jesus has a terrible jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He does not care, it seems, for the wife's tears or the husband's sympathy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more the tears, the more He will take away her husband for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is jealous for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is a jealous God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the prayer of the seeking one continues in this way: "Jealousy is cruel as Sheol: the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, which hath a most vehement flame."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>With this love and with this jealousy is a flashing fire.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have already seen that God is not only a jealous God, but also a consuming God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"The Lord thy God is a consuming fire."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These two go together the consuming God and the jealous God, the consuming fire and the jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Chapter eight of the Song of Songs reminds us that even when we become so matured, we are only sinners saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should never trust in ourselves, but put our trust in the jealous love of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then we will be fully kept and preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We will never be carried away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Otherwise, no matter how strong we are, we could be stolen away from the Lord by other things.</S>
