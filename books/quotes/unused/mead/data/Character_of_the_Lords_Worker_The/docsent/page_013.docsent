   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Unless we can humble ourselves to the lowest level, we cannot serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must be brought to the lowest point; we must never feel that we are better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No brother or sister can despise a man of little knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such a person has a place in God's creation; he has a place in God's redemption and plan just as you and I have.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The only difference between us and an unsaved man is that we know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brothers and sisters, we are wrong in our attitude in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must turn away completely from such an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must see that all men are equal in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our Lord came to earth for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we should humble ourselves for them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should never categorize men based on the amount of education they possess.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may say, "The ignorance of men presents no problem to me; my difficulty arises when I come in contact with men who are deceitful, sinful, and wild.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What should be my attitude toward them?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You only need to take a retrospective look at your own life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Were you better than they are now before the grace of God reached out?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How much better would you be today but for the grace of God?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who has made you holier than they?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When you look at yourself outside the realm of grace, you cannot find any difference between you and them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Except for grace alone, what makes you any different than them?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You can only bow before God and say, "I am the same as they are, nothing more than a poor sinner."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only grace can teach you to prostrate yourself in the dust and say, "Lord, You are the One who has saved me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Grace will never cause you to uplift yourself; it will always cause you to see that you are the same as the wicked and the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is God's grace that sets you apart from them, not you yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If what you have is yours through receiving, what is there for you to boast of?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If grace is the only thing that makes you different, you have no ground to exalt yourself with such grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You should give more thanks for grace; you should spend more time thanking the Lord for grace instead of giving glory to yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You should realize that you are the same as all other men in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You should love them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their sins should cause you to recoil, but you should still go out in love for them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With such an enlarged heart, you will bring them to the Lord.</S>
