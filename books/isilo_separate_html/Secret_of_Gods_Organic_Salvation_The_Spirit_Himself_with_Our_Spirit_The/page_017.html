The Issue of Renewing</h2><p>Transformation is by renewing; it is the issue of renewing. Romans 12:2 says, &ldquo;Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; This indicates that transformation is the issue of renewing.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Transformation in the Believers&rsquo; Soul</h2><p>Renewing is mainly in the believers&rsquo; mind (Eph. 4:23); transformation is in the believers&rsquo; soul for their entire being.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Not Outward Correction or Adjustment</h2><p>Transformation is not any kind of outward correction or adjustment.</p><h2 class="head3">4. A Kind of Metabolism</h2><p>Transformation is a kind of metabolism, by the addition of the element of the divine life of Christ into the believers&rsquo; being, to be expressed outwardly in the image of Christ. This can be illustrated by having a healthy complexion through proper nutrition. The way to have such a healthy complexion is not to apply cosmetics but to eat nourishing food and then to digest and assimilate it metabolically. If we eat properly, the food we digest and assimilate will supply us with a new element which will eventually produce an outward and visible change in our facial color. The principle is the same with transformation. Transformation is a matter of inward metabolism issuing in an outward expression.</p><h2 class="head3">5. By the Lord Spirit</h2><p>Transformation is accomplished by the Lord Spirit (the pneumatic Christ), transforming the believers into the image of the glory of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18). The metabolism involved in transformation eventually transforms us into the image of the glory of Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">6. To Behold the Lord with an Unveiled Face</h2><p>The believers should behold the Lord with an unveiled face and reflect Him like a mirror to express Him. This gives the ground and the way for the transforming Spirit to transform the believers&rsquo; entire being into the glorious image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God who expresses God to the uttermost.</p><h2 class="head3">7. To Live and Walk by the Spirit</h2><p>The believers should live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25) and walk according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4b), that the divine life of Christ may have the way to regulate them and transform them into the image of the Lord in glory.</p><h2 class="head3">8. To Be Consummated by Conformation</h2><p>Transformation should be consummated by conformation, which is maturity in the divine life for the believers to be conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God, to fully participate in God&rsquo;s divinity. Thus, they manifest God in life, in nature, in inward thinking, and in outward expression to enjoy the divine sonship and to participate in God&rsquo;s divinity in full.</p><p>At this point I would like to say a further word about a new utterance which the Lord has given us: <i>participate in God&rsquo;s divinity.</i>This language is very strange and marvelous. I believe that this word about participating in God&rsquo;s divinity is something altogether new. In God&rsquo;s organic salvation we, the believers in Christ, can participate in God&rsquo;s divinity. God&rsquo;s life has been imparted into our life, His nature is being wrought into our nature, His mind is being wrought into our mind, and we even have His divine element, the element of the riches of His unsearchable life, to transform our entire being. Thus, we have God&rsquo;s life, God&rsquo;s nature, God&rsquo;s mind, and the divine element of all His riches, and now we can participate in God&rsquo;s divinity in full. For us to participate in God&rsquo;s divinity means that He is making us Him. He is making us God in His life, in His nature, in His thinking, and in His expression but not, of course, in His Godhead.</p><p>For God to work Himself into us in such a way is not merely to make us holy, and it is not merely to make us perfect, victorious, and spiritual. God is working His life, nature, mind, and element into us in order to make us God in life, in nature, in mind, and in expression.</p><p>Regarding this, I have a very heavy burden for you all, especially for the co-workers and elders. I have the full assurance that you are one with the ministry for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and I appreciate this. However, I am very concerned that you may not realize and acknowledge that God has imparted His life into us, that He is working His nature into our nature, that He is working His mind into our mind, and that He is working the element of His unsearchable riches into our entire being, especially into our spirit and our soul. Eventually, when our body is glorified, we will be the same as God in every part of our being. This is not a human thought&mdash;it is the divine revelation. We all need to see this and we all need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, work Yourself into me richly in every aspect&mdash;in the aspects of Your life, Your nature, Your mind, and Your rich element&mdash;to make my whole being, spirit, soul, and body, the same as You are.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
