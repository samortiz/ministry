   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Life That Affects Others</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 7:37 and 38 say, "Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rivers of living water will flow out of whose innermost being?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They will not flow out of only special Christians or the apostles Paul, Peter, or John, but out of all those who believe, out of ordinary men like us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is out of the innermost being of men like us that rivers of living water will flow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When men touch us, they should be satisfied and cease from their thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I had a friend whose simple contact with others made them feel the banality of the world, the foolishness of ambition, and the tastelessness of greed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Someone might feel dissatisfied about something.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But as soon as he contacted her, he would find that the Lord is enough to satisfy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the other hand, one might feel satisfied about something, but as soon as he contacted her, he would find these things to be worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord said those who believe into Him will have rivers of living water flowing out of their innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This should be the common experience of all ordinary Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What I am talking about is not the experience of special Christians but the experience of all common Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brothers and sisters, do others stop thirsting when they touch us?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Or do they continue in their thirst?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If others complain about their sufferings and we also complain, if others feel sorrowful and we also feel sorrowful, and if others confess their failures and we also confess our failures, we are not rivers of living water but dry deserts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even the grass of others will be dried up by us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When this happens, either God is wrong or we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God cannot be wrong, so it must be we who are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A Life That Is Free from the Power of Sin</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us see what happens in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 26 of chapter three says, "God, having raised up His Servant, has sent Him to bless you in turning each of you away from your wicked deeds."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter's message at the portico of the temple still speaks of our condition today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus' accomplishment is more than able to deliver us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One basic experience of a Christian should be deliverance from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As Christians, we should at least overcome the known sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may not overcome the sins that we do not know about.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But we should overcome by the Lord all the sins that we know about.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may have many besetting sins that have plagued us for years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By the power of the Lord, we should overcome all these sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the biblical standard.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man should only be occasionally overtaken by offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But our experience is that we only occasionally overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How abnormal is our experience!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 6:1-2 says, "What then shall we say?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Should we continue in sin that grace may abound?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We who have died to sin, how shall we still live in it?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every person who has believed in the Lord Jesus and has become a Christian is dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No one who has believed in the Lord Jesus and has become a Christian should live in sin any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But how do we know that we are dead to sin?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The next verse provides the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 3 says, "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, everyone who is baptized and saved is dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a person is baptized, he becomes dead in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 4 says, "We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This should be the daily life of every Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everyone who is baptized should walk in newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not a verse for some special Christians; it is for Christians who are saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all have been baptized; therefore, we all should walk in newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the experience that God has ordained for every Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Are we those who walk in newness of life?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Romans 6:14 says, "For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I treasure this verse very much!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brothers and sisters, who is not under the law but under grace?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Is Andrew Murray the only one?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are Paul, Peter, or John the only ones?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Or are all those who have believed not under the law but under grace?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How many of you sitting here today are under grace?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thank and praise our God, we are all under grace!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>None of us is under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, there is another sentence prior to this sentence: "Sin will not lord it over you."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thank and praise the Lord, sin will not lord it over us!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Thank and praise Him that victory is not only the experience of some special Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank and praise God that victory is the experience of ordinary Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thank and praise Him that every saved Christian is under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When I was first saved, I saw this verse and treasured it very much.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I realized that I had experienced many victories and had overcome many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I realized that God had graced me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But there was still one sin which lorded it over me.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In fact, a few sins always came back to visit me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I had overcome several sins, but a few other sins often came back to visit me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This was like my experience with a brother one day.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I met him on the street and nodded to him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then I went into a shop to buy something.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When I came out, I met him coming my way, and I nodded to him again.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then I went into a second store and bought something else.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When I came out, I met him yet again and nodded to him once more.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When I turned to the next street, I met him and nodded to him again.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I turned on to a second street and met him once again and nodded to him yet another time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In all I met and nodded to him five times that day.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We encounter sins the same way that I encountered this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It seems that sin purposely tries to meet us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We are always running into it; it seems that it is constantly following us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Temper seems to follow some all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Pride and jealousy seem to follow others all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Laziness seems to follow one, and lies seem to follow another.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>One finds himself always having an unforgiving spirit while another is plagued continually by base desires or selfishness.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Some find unclean thoughts following them all the time, while others find unclean lusts following them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Everyone seems to have at least one sin which follows him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I had a few sins which continually plagued me.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I had to admit that sin lorded it over me!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God says that sin will not lord it over me, but I had to confess that something was wrong with me.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I had to admit that the mistake was in me and not in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Brothers and sisters, if we are living a defeated life, we should know that this is not what God ordained for us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have to know that it is not God's intention for sin to lord it over us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>His Word says that sin will not lord it over us!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Romans 8:1 says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I have expounded on the word condemnation many times.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>About twenty years ago someone discovered some ancient manuscripts and found that there were two meanings to this word.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>One is used in a civil context and the other in a legal context.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>According to its civil application, it can be translated "impotence."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Hence, this verse can be translated, "There is now then no impotence to those who are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Brothers and sisters, how wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But for whom is this verse written?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Is it only for John Wesley?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Is it only for Martin Luther or for Hudson Taylor?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>What does the Bible say?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It says, "There is now then no impotence to those who are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Who are these ones?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>They are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Every Christian is a person who is in Christ Jesus, and every one of them is no longer impotent.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Verse 2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I will repeat a hundred times that it is not special Christians only who are delivered from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Every Christian should be delivered from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>What is the meaning of being impotent?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>According to Romans 7, it means doing what one hates and not practicing what one wills.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>It is finding that "to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not."</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The meaning of impotence is being unable to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The history of many Christians is one of constant resolutions and constant breaking of resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>They continually resolve to do something and continually fail.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>But thank and praise the Lord, God's Word says that no Christian is impotent any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>What is a law?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>It is something that happens again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>With a law, the same action produces the same result under whatever circumstances the action is performed.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>A law is a steady phenomenon; it is a constant tendency, a condition that continues to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>For example, there is the force of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Whenever an object is dropped, gravity will draw it downward.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>This gravitational force is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>With some people, losing their temper is a law.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>They may hold back once or twice, but they are provoked the third time.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>By the fourth time, they lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>This happens to one brother after another.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>One may hold back at the beginning, but eventually his temper breaks out.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Every time a temptation comes, the same result occurs.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>We observe that the same is true with the matter of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>When others say one good word about you, you may not be moved.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>But when they say a second good word about you, your expression immediately changes and your face shines.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>A law is anything that gives the same result when it goes through the same steps.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Sin has become a law for us.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Many brothers are agreeable in some things, but they are provoked as soon as they are stirred up in other things.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>They can overcome many things, but as soon as they encounter certain other things, they are provoked.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Brothers and sisters, it does not take special Christians to overcome the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>No Christian has to remain impotent.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Every Christian can be delivered from the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>All of the above verses are facts; they are not commands.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Every Christian should have these experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Yet our experience does not quite match God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>How sad this is!</S>
