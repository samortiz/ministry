   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In His perfect redemption through His death judicially and in His complete salvation by His life organically for the carrying out of God's eternal economy, Christ is the Feast of the Passover John 6:4; 1 Cor 5:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 5:7 says that Christ our Passover has been sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is not only the Passover lamb but also the entire Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then verse 8 says that today we are keeping the reality of the Feast of Unleavened Bread as the continuation of the Passover Exo 12:15-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The feast is a time for the enjoyment of the banquet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The entire Christian life should be such a feast, such an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet, the rich supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The feast is a table for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's table is a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Psalm 23:5 says that the Lord prepares a table, a feast, for us to enjoy in the presence of our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The First Feast</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Leviticus 23 says that God ordained seven annual feasts for His elect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first one was the Passover v. 5 , and the last one was the Feast of Tabernacles v. 34 . The Passover is the initiation, and the Feast of Tabernacles is the consummation of our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Passover, the first feast of all the feasts ordained by God for His people, typifies that Christ is the beginning of our enjoyment of Him that originates our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The entire Christian life should be a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At other times we have said that the Christian life is a suffering life, but we suffer so that we can feast more.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our suffering helps us to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, our suffering becomes our feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why Psalm 23:5 says that the Lord has prepared a table before us in the presence of our enemies.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Main Enjoyments</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this feast the main enjoyments are the Passover lamb with its blood for redeeming and its flesh for fighting and walking, and the unleavened bread, signifying a sinless living Exo 12:5-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The flesh of the lamb is organic and the blood is judicial.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The blood redeems us judicially and the flesh of the lamb is for God's elect to eat so that they can be nourished and strengthened to walk out of Egypt organically.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ today is the Lamb with His blood for redemption and with Himself for strengthening and nourishing us so that we can walk on God's way out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the same time, we also eat Christ as the unleavened bread, signifying that we are living a sinless life.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Partaking of Christ through His Word,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Which Is Spirit and Life to Us</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the enjoyment of Christ we must eat His flesh and drink His blood that we may have His eternal life John 6:54 and eat Him as the heavenly bread that we may live forever v. 58 through His word, which is spirit and life to us v. 63 . In John 3 we saw that Christ as the Bridegroom, who is above all things vv.</S>
