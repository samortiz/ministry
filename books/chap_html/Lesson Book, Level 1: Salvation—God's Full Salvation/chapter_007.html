<h2 class="head1">I. THE OBJECTIVE PROBLEM BEFORE GOD</h2>
<p>As a result of the fall, man&rsquo;s first problem is before God, and it is objective. Objective means something having to do with us but outside of us. Do you remember the illustration of the child who disobeyed his mother and took in the poison? His problem of disobedience to his mother was objective, having to do with him but not something inside of him. By disobeying his mother, he was now in trouble with her and would be punished. Because of our fall in Adam, our objective problem before God is very great, and we will soon face God&rsquo;s punishment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Under God&rsquo;s Condemnation</h2>
<p>Because of Adam&rsquo;s disobedience, or transgression, we have all come under God&rsquo;s condemnation (Rom. 5:18a). When God created man, he did not create many men, but only one man. All men were included in this one man. So in God&rsquo;s eyes, when Adam sinned, we were included in this one sin, even though we ourselves may never have sinned in the same way. Because of this, when Adam was judged and came under God&rsquo;s condemnation, we were all judged and came under God&rsquo;s condemnation with him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Under the Wrath of God</h2>
<p>Because we were condemned by God in Adam, we are all under the wrath of God (John 3:36b). Because of Adam&rsquo;s sin, all men today are under the wrath of God and awaiting His final judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Awaiting God&rsquo;s Judgment</h2>
<p>Eventually, because of Adam&rsquo;s sin, man will be judged by God and cast into the lake of fire to suffer God&rsquo;s judgment for eternity (Heb. 9:27). The Bible tells us that God prepared the lake of fire not for man but for Satan and his fallen angels who followed him to rebel against God (Matt. 25:41).</p>
<p>But, because man was deceived and followed Satan to rebel against God by disobeying Him, man must now also suffer God&rsquo;s judgment in the lake of fire with Satan (Rev. 20:15).</p>
<p>Outwardly, and before God, this is the terrible condition into which man fell because of Adam&rsquo;s transgression. Rather than enjoying God&rsquo;s life and expressing Him, man has been condemned to die and to suffer Satan&rsquo;s judgment with him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE SUBJECTIVE PROBLEM WITHIN HIMSELF</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s second problem resulting from the fall is subjective, that is, within himself. Using our earlier illustration of the disobedient child, this is the problem of the poison that man took into him, not the problem of his disobedience. By taking in the tree of knowledge, man did not merely do something wrong which could be solved by God&rsquo;s forgiveness. He actually took in the very life of Satan. When this satanic life entered into man, his entire being was deadened, ruined and corrupted.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Deadened in His Spirit</h2>
<p>First, when the satanic life entered into man, his spirit was deadened. He became dead in sins (Eph. 2:1). Because man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened, it lost its function to contact God and to receive Him as life. Today, because man&rsquo;s spirit has been deadened, men have lost their ability to contact God, and so many do not believe in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Ruined in His Soul</h2>
<p>When the satanic life entered into man, it ruined man&rsquo;s soul for God&rsquo;s purpose. His mind, which God had created to know God, became darkened and blinded, unable to know Him (Eph. 4:17-18a). His mind became filled with vain thoughts and foolish reasonings that have turned him away from God and His purpose. His emotion, which was created to love God, was turned away from loving Him. Now, man&rsquo;s emotion loves anything and everything else but God and even hates Him (2 Tim. 3:2-4). Finally, his will, which God created for man to choose Him and obey Him, became rebellious against God (Eph. 2:2b). Now man&rsquo;s will has forsaken God and is one with the will of God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan. Because of this, man himself has become the enemy of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Corrupted in His Body</h2>
<p>When Adam took the fruit of the tree of knowledge into him, the sinful life of Satan entered into his body and changed it into the sinful flesh. Now, the sinful life of Satan is in man&rsquo;s body (Rom. 7:17-18a). It is this life, full of lusts and every evil thing, that makes man&rsquo;s body a body of sin, so strong to sin, and a body of death, so weak to serve the Lord and to please Him (Rom. 6:6b; 7:24).</p>
<p>We can see from this that man was condemned by God outwardly, or objectively, and ruined by the satanic life inwardly, or subjectively. Because this sinful life has entered into man, he has even become a child of the Devil (John 8:44; Eph. 2:2b). In such a pitiful and ruined condition, man is helpless to save himself and utterly hopeless. All that he has to look forward to is a life full of sin and God&rsquo;s eternal punishment in the future. This is the condition that all men, including you and I, fell into as the result of Adam&rsquo;s sin. It was such a horrible condition that caused God, in His love, to come to save us.</p>
