<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in meetings for the elders and co-workers in Asia held in Manila, Philippines, on October 22 through 26, 1979. These messages were published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> from 1980 to 1981.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT<br />
AND<br />
THE PROBLEM<br />
OF THE NATURAL CONSTITUTION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD CONFIRMING<br />
THE WAY OF THE CHURCH IN HISTORY</h2>
<p>The doctrine concerning the way of the church and concerning the ground of the church is clear to us. Furthermore, our experience in the past forty to fifty years proves that the way of the church and the ground of the church are right. Whether in Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Europe, or America, those among us who had problems with this way or this ground did not have a good ending.</p>
<p>I was saved in April of 1925. Less than three months after my salvation I came across articles written by Brother Nee. At that time, I was not yet twenty years old. Brother Nee was only two years older than I, but his articles were posted in a Christian publication called <em>The Morning Star.</em> Because of my love for the Lord and my appetite for spiritual books, I was attracted by Brother Nee&rsquo;s articles. I felt that his articles were unique. When he published <em>The Christian,</em> I wrote to him and inquired about spiritual matters. That was when we began corresponding. Seven years later, in 1932, I recommended Brother Nee to the denomination where I used to meet. Because they had a good impression of me, they accepted my recommendation and invited Brother Nee. I also wrote Brother Nee personally and requested that he come. That was the first time we met in person. From that meeting I realized that Brother Nee knew the truth. Brother Nee led me to touch the spirit and helped me to receive the life supply.</p>
<p>At that time, I was at a turning point in life and in the Lord. Later, the Lord raised up the church in Chefoo, which was the first church in northern China. In July of 1932 we started the bread-breaking meeting in my living room. From the very beginning this meeting was under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. We began with a few people, but by the summer of the following year our number had increased to nearly one hundred, so we rented a building for our meeting place.</p>
<p>In April of 1933 Brother Nee visited Chefoo again, and we had more fellowship. At the time, I had the sense that the Lord wanted me to drop my job and serve Him full time. This was a heavy burden. However, I had little experience concerning such matters. Brother Nee was experienced, but he did not touch the matter directly. Those who have had interactions with Brother Nee know that he preferred for people to receive leading from the Lord. In August, while I was struggling with the Lord concerning whether I should drop my job, Brother Nee wrote me a letter that said, &ldquo;Brother Witness, as for your future, I feel that you should serve the Lord with your full time. How do you feel? May the Lord lead you.&rdquo; That letter was a great encouragement to me. By the end of August I had quit my job, and in October I went to Shanghai and stayed with Brother Nee for about four months. From that time onward, I was clear that I was not following Brother Watchman Nee as a man; rather, I saw the Lord in him. I saw clearly that the way he was leading us to take was the way that the Lord desired. Therefore, I made the decision to take this way. After nearly half a century I have no regrets. I thank the Lord for keeping me in this way until now.</p>
<p>During the past fifty years, I have seen much. Some people had a good beginning and admired this way, but after a while they caused trouble with their opinions and then deviated from this way. I can testify that those who had problems with the church did not receive the blessing. Eventually, they came to a spiritual dead end. This is history, not a criticism.</p>
<p>Let us consider the history of the churches in Taiwan. Over the years since 1957, those who have left have lost the blessing. Those who took the Pentecostal way and those who proclaimed that they had seen the vision of the &ldquo;full&rdquo; Christ are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>In the United States many Christians who were zealous for the Lord were absolute when they came into the church. After a while, however, some of them had problems with the church and left. They were prominent men, eloquent speakers, and excellent writers, but they had no way to go on after they left, and they even realized this fact.</p>
<p>The law and principle of God in the universe are that He has only one way. The universe is monistic, not dualistic; everything is one. Hence, God ordained one husband and one wife. To have two husbands or two wives violates the law of God. The church is also monistic: one Body, one church. When the church is manifested in a locality, it is always one. Those who do not keep the principle of oneness will lose the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The churches in Malaysia have existed for more than thirty years. Those who had a problem with the church or who were dissenting and left the church lost the blessing. The brothers in Indonesia can testify that those who are honest and orderly in the church enjoy both peace and blessing and that those who had a problem and left lost the blessing eventually. In particular, those who were ambitious and then left lost the blessing.</p>
<p>These experiences prove that God&rsquo;s way is one and that the ground is the ground of oneness. This does not mean that we are perfect or that we do everything well. We have to admit that we have our shortcomings and mistakes, but these mistakes reflect a problem with ourselves, not with the truth. This way is still the way of the Lord, and this ground is still the ground of the Lord, both of which are in the principle of oneness. We thank the Lord for keeping us by His mercy in this way in spite of our mistakes.</p>
<p>The Lord has blessed us because we walk on this way. More than fifty years ago Brother Watchman Nee had a burden to work for the Lord and began publishing literature. Although he was very young at the time, he was greatly used by the Lord. He was a young Chinese man, whom the Western missionaries disregarded, but he brought a tremendous blessing to China. I have not seen another person whose work was as blessed by the Lord as Brother Nee&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Afterward, we left mainland China and came to Taiwan. I came to Taiwan with my family of ten plus two servants, whom we could not dismiss. In all, twelve people were crowded into a house that was the size of sixteen straw mats. At that time, I was extremely disappointed and felt that there was nothing to do in Taiwan. One day as I was lying on the bed and staring at the ceiling, I asked myself what I was doing here. I was frustrated. Then the Lord said to me, &ldquo;Rise up and take a train from Taipei to Kaohsiung. Visit every place where there are brothers and sisters.&rdquo; Hence, I traveled to every place from the north to the south. When I returned, I told the brothers that we should begin the work because there was work to be done in Taiwan. In spite of the political tension, our only concern was to preach the gospel. We posted gospel banners at every major intersection, at bus stations and train stations, and on the streets. We printed gospel tracts according to the population of Taipei and distributed them to every house, and we held gospel marches to spread the gospel. Many elders and deacons were brought in through that preaching of the gospel. In six years&rsquo; time, from 1949 to 1955, our number increased from about four hundred to more than thirty thousand.</p>
<p>The denominations and missionaries in Taiwan opposed us, but they admitted that our work was the most effective and was blessed. However, they also spoke of &ldquo;a dead fly being in the fragrant ointment.&rdquo; The &ldquo;dead fly&rdquo; was a reference to the ground of the church: one church in one city. They could not accept this.</p>
<p>At the end of 1961 I made a third visit to the United States, and the Lord led me to stay there permanently. Brother Nee was a young student when he was raised up in China, but the Lord used him greatly. I was nearly sixty years old when I went to the United States. I am a Chinese who learned English when I was young and had never received an education in the United States. What could I do there? But the Lord poured out His blessing. Currently, there are more than seventy churches throughout the United States. Not only so, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery quickly spread from the United States to Europe, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and even Africa. The Lord&rsquo;s testimony is now on every continent.</p>
<p>My point is that we are not important figures, nor are we prominent people. We are nothing and nobody, but the Lord blesses His way. This way and this ground are of Him and are firm. Hence, the Lord has blessed us.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR URGENT NEED BEING TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>While we take this way and stand on this ground, the Lord has released His riches to us again and again. We worship the Lord, because we have the proper way, the proper ground, and the riches of the truth and of life. However, our urgent need is to live in our spirit. Our spirit needs to be strengthened, and the testimony of life needs to be shining. The saints in every locality must have a shining testimony so that the lampstand can shine among the people. In order for the lampstand to shine, our spirit must be strengthened. If our spirit is strengthened and we grow in life, the light of life will spontaneously shine.</p>
<p>Our way is right, the ground is proper, and the Lord has released His riches to us. But we must ask whether our spirit is strong and whether we are growing in life. The church life began in 1922. For the past fifty-seven years, more than half a century, we have passed through many tests and trials in China, Southeast Asia, Europe, America, and Africa. The tests, trials, attacks, and oppositions have proved that this way is right and proper, that this way cannot be defeated and cannot be denied, and that this way is under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. Hence, the Lord is still releasing His rich word every year. However, our present need is for the elders, co-workers, and leading brothers and sisters to be strengthened in the spirit and to exercise their spirit to apply these riches so that these riches may be assimilated into the churches for the saints to grow in life.</p>
<p>We must do a particular work. We must not turn our attention to other things but should focus on being strengthened in our spirit and on the growth of the divine life in the local churches. The truth and light in the Life-studies will continue to be released, and the riches will continue to be ministered. In practice, however, the churches must turn to the spirit. The saints must be strong in spirit and grow in life. This is what we lack. It is not a matter of the way being wrong or of the ground not being proper, nor is it that we do not have the riches. Rather, it is a matter of how much the leading ones apply these riches. In order to apply these riches, we must turn to the spirit. We need to be strong in our spirit and grow in life so that we will be rich in life.</p>
<p>Some people may have the wrong understanding that the strengthening of the spirit refers to speaking and praying with a loud voice in the meetings. Loudly proclaiming is not the meaning of being strong in our spirit. To be strengthened in our spirit means that we live and walk according to the spirit in everything, both great and small, at every time and in every place. If we are not in our spirit, we should not act or move. We must act and move by our spirit. This is what pleases the Lord.</p>
<p>If we want to live in our spirit, we must love the Lord. We must always tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, I love You. Because I love You, I care for Your heart and take You as my life. Lord, You are the Spirit living in my spirit. I am willing to live and walk in the mingled spirit to satisfy the desire of Your heart.&rdquo; This is what pleases the Lord, but it is also what we are lacking.</p>
<p>Being in the spirit is a matter of life, a matter of our living. Daily we need to learn to live in the spirit of prayer and to touch the spirit whenever we pray. However, we often do not touch the spirit when we pray, because we do not have the habit of praying in our spirit. Instead of praying in our spirit, we pray in our mind, according to our memory, and with the excitement of our emotions. Thankfully, however, although we often do not begin praying in the spirit, we eventually pray ourselves into the spirit to touch the Lord and enjoy Him, and we are joined to Him as one spirit. This is the way for us to live in an atmosphere of prayer. We should live in an atmosphere of prayer while we are praying, and we should also live in an atmosphere of prayer in our daily life, even if we are not praying outwardly. In other words, we need to pray all day long. To pray unceasingly does not mean that we pray for many things from morning to evening but that our whole being is in the spirit of prayer. Whether we are giving a message, fellowshipping with the saints, taking care of business matters, working, or handling various affairs, we should live and walk by touching the Lord in our spirit. However, this is our lack. This is what the Lord has desired to gain for over two thousand years. It is not easy to attain to such a living, because there are too many things that replace our living in the spirit.</p>
<p>It is natural for us to live in the replacements, because we are born in the replacements, raised up in the replacements, and are accustomed to living in the replacements. We have been nurtured, educated, cultivated, and influenced in a way that enables us to live without God. We can live as proper and good persons apart from God and apart from the Spirit. However, to live apart from God is the greatest sin and is even an act of rebellion. It is a sin for unsaved persons not to believe in the Lord. It is also a sin for saved persons not to live the Lord and not to live by the Lord. God has given the unbelievers a commandment: &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus&rdquo; (Acts 16:31). This is the only commandment to unbelievers. God has also given believers a commandment: &ldquo;Walk...according to the spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 8:4). To live and walk according to the spirit is to live Christ and to live out Christ. Regrettably, we violate this commandment every day, because we still do not live and walk according to the spirit in all things, at every time, and in every place. We understand this truth, we agree with it, and we have been touched by it. However, we still have all kinds of &ldquo;replacements&rdquo; for the spirit in our practical living.</p>
<p>If we would live and walk according to our spirit, the problems, defects, and shortcomings of our natural constitution would be resolved, because the problems, defects, and shortcomings of our natural constitution are in our self, not in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM OF NATURAL CONSTITUTION</h2>
<p>Our natural constitution has many problems, shortcomings, and defects. Whether a church is under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing does not depend on eloquent speakers or capable persons. I told the saints in the United States that we should thank the Lord because two kinds of persons have left the churches in the United States: &ldquo;donkeys&rdquo; and &ldquo;monkeys.&rdquo; The church is a flock of sheep; we are all sheep. However, donkeys are taller than sheep, and they jump and kick wildly. Monkeys are clever and good at playing tricks. Everyone suffers when there are donkeys and monkeys in the church. The church receives blessings because it is a flock of sheep, not because there are big donkeys and clever monkeys. As long as we are a flock of sheep, there will be the blessing.</p>
<p>We may think that we have been under the blessing because we are not big donkeys or clever monkeys. However, even though we may not be big donkeys or clever monkeys, we still need to bow down and confess that we have the temper of a donkey and the cleverness of a monkey. In the church we often are wild and still play tricks.</p>
<p>There is a church in North America that could not go on for many years. In recent years the Lord raised up an environment that forced the donkeys and monkeys to leave. Now there are no more donkeys and monkeys; there is only a flock of little sheep in that locality. Outsiders have asked, &ldquo;How can there be any blessing when no one is left to take the lead?&rdquo; But that church is now under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. The brothers do not have the gift of speaking, nor are they capable of administrating; hence, they always fellowship with the Lord and with one another. There are no conflicts among them, nor are there peculiar tempers. As a result, the Lord&rsquo;s blessing is with them.</p>
<p>The Lord has enlightened us to see the way that matches His heart concerning the ground of oneness. We know that other ways do not work, so we must take this way. However, we must take this way together; we cannot walk on it alone. It is not easy to walk with others. If there is only one person, he can decide how to walk, but it is not easy for four people to carry a palanquin, because of differences in their height, pace, and temperament. When four people work together, their peculiarities will immediately be manifested.</p>
<p>For example, suppose there are younger and older elders in a locality. These elders should open to one another and should have equal consideration for one another. It is not acceptable for one elder to think that the other three are under him, nor should he say, &ldquo;I am the only one taking the lead. The other three must listen to me.&rdquo; In such a situation there will be no blessing, even if the way and the ground are right. As long as there are some who depend on their seniority and take pride in their seniority, the Spirit will have no way to work. Whether the elders are old or young, strong or weak, if they are bearing responsibility together, they should stand on equal footing, fellowshipping with one another and being open to one another in all things. A situation in which the elders merely tolerate one another to avoid arguments may seem to be fine, but it will not yield results in the spirit.</p>
<p>People can succeed in society by clever maneuvering, but such maneuvering does not work in the church. Clever maneuvering involves playing tricks and can be likened to burying a corpse in the snow. The corpse will be hidden for a few months. However, when spring comes and the snow melts, the corpse will be exposed. Those who do things by clever maneuvering and tricks are deceiving others as well as themselves. After a while the saints in the church will know that such a person is not genuine, sincere, or faithful. The church life is a long-term matter; hence, our heart and condition cannot be hidden. The wisest way is to be open and to not hide things. If we agree, we should say that we agree, but if we disagree, we should say that we disagree. We should not insist on our opinions, nor should we pretend to be polite. We should be fully open and present ourselves without playing politics or clever maneuvering. When saints coordinate together, nothing should be hidden, but everything should be open. We will have genuine fellowship and prayer when we are only little sheep without clever maneuvering or peculiar temperaments. If we are not sheep, we will merely go through the motions of praying, but our prayer will be a pretense. If we do not fellowship in the spirit, are not in harmony, and do not have genuine one accord, it will be hard for us to receive the blessing.</p>
<p>When we live in the spirit, we will not maneuver, nor will we be foolish. Our spirit is sober and can be likened to the sense of smell. If we live in our spirit, we will know the true condition of those whom we contact. In the Lord&rsquo;s work, in the administration of the church, and in the shepherding and perfecting of the saints, human wisdom and cleverness are useless and only spread death. Clever maneuvering involves deceiving people. If we use clever maneuvering in our dealings with the saints, we will eventually offend them. We must deal with others in truthfulness, that is, in spirit, without tricks and maneuvering. May we all be faithful to live in the spirit. If the Lord leads us to do something, we should do it, but if the Lord does not lead us, we should not do anything. We should not do things in order to please others. We do not speak to please others. If we do not speak, it is not because we are maneuvering but because we are in the spirit. If the Spirit guides us not to speak, we should not speak, but if the Spirit guides us to speak, we should speak. I do not hide things from the brothers. I do not use human wisdom or clever maneuvering with the brothers, nor do I insist on my opinions. I am open, and I treat others equally. If we are open and treat others equally, the Spirit will have a free way among us, and the blessing will come. Furthermore, the responsible brothers will gain the respect and trust of the saints. Our only way is to live in the spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">TEN &ldquo;WORMS&rdquo; THAT DESTROY THE ONENESS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 133</h1>
<h2 class="head1">HOW GOOD AND HOW PLEASANT IT IS<br />
TO DWELL TOGETHER IN ONENESS</h2>
<p>Psalm 133 is a clear description of a local church that is under God&rsquo;s blessing. In such a local church the fine oil is flowing, and the dew of Hermon is descending (vv. 2-3). God&rsquo;s blessing to the church is simply life, which is also God Himself. This psalm is symmetrical in content; it has two items, two conditions, and two issues. The two items are the fine oil and the dew of Hermon, the two conditions are goodness and pleasantness, and the two issues are a flowing and a descending. In this psalm we can see the condition of a local church that is under God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>The blessing upon a local church depends on the believers&rsquo; dwelling in unity (v. 1). Unity in this verse is a picture of the genuine oneness in the church. Oneness is higher than unity. When there is oneness, there is no need for uniting. The blessing on the church depends on our dwelling in oneness. We should compare the church in our locality with the description in this psalm to see whether the church is in oneness or divided. When the church has oneness, the fine oil will flow, and the dew will descend.</p>
<p>The elders are the key to a local church being under the blessing. When there is oneness among the elders, the saints will sing hymns and praise. When the elders lack the oneness, the whole church will suffer; there will be no growth in life, and the church will not be able to go on positively. Hence, the most important thing in our serving the church is the oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TEN &ldquo;WORMS&rdquo;<br />
THAT DESTROY THE ONENESS</h2>
<p>It is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that has kept us in the proper oneness of the church all these years. On the one hand, we worship Him, because although many people have fallen away, we are still on this way. On the other hand, we admit that in many aspects we are still not one. We should ask ourselves whether there is the genuine oneness in our local church. We should not ask whether our church is good or bad but whether it has the genuine oneness. There is oneness in every local church, but that oneness can be damaged, because there are many &ldquo;worms&rdquo; that eat away at our oneness. The oneness in the local churches can be eaten by these worms to such an extent that there is only a thin layer of oneness left. In this chapter we will examine ten worms that destroy the oneness so that we can kill the worms one by one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Controlling</h2>
<p>A brother who is controlling thinks of himself as being the top elder, the first among the elders; he considers the other elders merely as helpers. This is a big worm. The oneness in many churches has been eaten by this worm. Although several people appear to bear responsibility together in coordination, when something happens, a brother already has an opinion concerning what to do and only goes through the motion of asking others for input. This worm destroys the oneness and must not be allowed.</p>
<p>Whoever wants to be first in the church will be the first to destroy the oneness. From the human viewpoint, there is a need for control so that there will not be chaos in a church with many people. Of course, there must be administration for the sake of orderliness in the church, but administrating is not controlling. Controlling is not allowed. We should not be the one who always voices our opinions and makes decisions. Anything to be decided upon must be presented to the elders so that they may have thorough prayer together and then fellowship. After they fellowship thoroughly, the elders can make decisions. This is the way to kill the first worm.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Insisting On One&rsquo;s Own Views</h2>
<p>Almost everyone has the worm of insisting on his own views. This worm is hard to deal with because it is subtle. Suppose Brother A makes a suggestion that is not accepted by the other elders. Although Brother A may not fight for his suggestion, he privately does things according to his own way. This is to insist on one&rsquo;s own view. Brother A may seemingly drop his suggestion, and he will not say anything further; he will not express any opinions, nor will he fellowship. But by not fellowshipping, he has closed the door to the other brothers. If the suggestion that was accepted by the brothers does not work, he may say that he already knew that it would not work. This should not be practiced among the responsible brothers. The responsible brothers should learn to bring up matters for fellowship without insisting on their views.</p><h2 class="head2">Expressing Opinions</h2>
<p>We can make suggestions when we fellowship with the elders, but we should not have opinions. For example, it does not matter how the chairs in the meeting hall are arranged. Suppose someone insists that the chairs should be upside down. Can we accept such a suggestion? In order to keep the oneness in the church, we must learn to have no opinions. We should not think that having opinions is a small matter. If we have a problem with opinions, the worms of controlling and insisting on one&rsquo;s views will crawl out. As long as a matter does not involve fornication, sins, or idol worship, we should do our best to keep the oneness by not expressing our opinions.</p>
<p>I once rode with four brothers. When we came to a fork in the road, we stopped, and the four brothers began to discuss which road to take. They discussed for forty minutes but still could not reach a conclusion. I eventually told the brothers that it did not matter which road we took, because if we had not stopped to discuss which road to take, we would have already arrived at our destination.</p>
<p>The elders&rsquo; meeting is an indication of whether a local church dwells in oneness. There is hardly a locality in which the elders do not argue. The elders are like a married couple; it is rare to find elders who do not argue with one another. Some elders may not argue, but as long as they have different opinions or views, it is hard for them to be calm and peaceful. Our opinion is a small worm, but it will eat up the oneness. Hence, we must be careful. We must learn the lesson of not expressing our opinions with the brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having the Temperament of a Donkey</h2>
<p>A brother with the temperament of a donkey does not submit to others. A person with such a temperament thinks that he is superior to others. Almost every Christian desires to stand out and does not want to be a little lamb. Some brothers think that they are more qualified than the elders in the church. This is to have the temperament of a donkey. Often brothers who are unwilling to be elders also have the temperament of a donkey. Such brothers may say that they do not need to be elders, because Brother So-and-so is an elder. We are all born of Adam and therefore have the temperament of a donkey, so we are hard to deal with. If a donkey is in the midst of a flock of sheep and kicks and jumps wildly, thinking that he is higher than others, the flock will definitely suffer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being a &ldquo;Dragonfly&rdquo; in the Air</h2>
<p>Some people are like &ldquo;dragonflies&rdquo; in the air, flying aimlessly and always bumping into things. If such a brother is an elder, many saints will be crushed to death. Such impetuous people tear down the oneness among the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Playing &ldquo;Monkey&rdquo; Tricks</h2>
<p>In the church quite a few brothers play clever tricks like a monkey. We have suffered much from this in the church over the years. This worm has devastated the oneness in many local churches. We should have prospered more under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, but our oneness was eaten by the worm of people&rsquo;s trickery. As a result, we lost some of the blessing. What a tragic situation!</p>
<h2 class="head2">Playing Politics</h2>
<p>In the church it is better to be honest and simple. Of course, we need to exercise wisdom so that we know when we should speak and when we should not speak. However, we must not play politics. Playing politics can be likened to burying a corpse in the snow. When the snow melts, the corpse will be exposed. Playing politics gives place to the devil. Some people are not even aware that they are playing politics, because it is their habit. In our dealings with the saints we must be loyal, faithful, and sincere in the spirit. The more we are in the spirit, the simpler we will be. A simple person will gain the spiritual trust of the saints, and trust will bring in the blessing. If the saints lose spiritual trust in the responsible brothers, the church will lose its blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Evading Problems</h2>
<p>We should not create problems in the church, nor should we evade problems. Some people always evade problems; they leave the problems for others to bear. The more we evade problems, the bigger the problems will become. It is impossible to have no problems in the church. When problems arise, we should bring them to the Lord in prayer. We should pray with the saints in order to deal with and swallow up the problems, thus taking the problems as our bread (cf. Num. 14:9). We should not play politics or use trickery to deal with the problems. Politics and trickery generate problems and do further damage to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Clever</h2>
<p>We need wisdom, not cleverness, in order to administrate the church. Cleverness is the most harmful worm because it subtly brings many problems into the church. We cannot afford to be careless in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Assuming Positions</h2>
<p>Assuming positions means that some assume the position of an apostle or an elder in the church. When the testimony of the church begins in a locality, some saints serve zealously and assume the position of an elder. These saints think that they are the only ones qualified to be elders. When the co-workers go to such places to serve, these brothers are accommodating, but the service is not smooth. Some brothers who should be elders are unwilling to be elders, but others who should not be elders assume the position of an elder. This is the primary reason that some local churches are not strong.</p>
<p>These ten worms are ten intrinsic factors that damage the oneness in the church. If instead of being watchful we allow these ten worms to continue to eat, the oneness of the church will be destroyed. The most terrible thing about worms is that they cannot be seen from the surface. By the time we see them, it is already too late. Whether in a family or in the church, the oneness is crucial and must not be damaged. When the oneness is damaged, the ointment will not flow, and the dew will not descend. Some churches do not receive the blessing, because the oneness has been damaged. If we would deal with these worms, within a short period of time the churches would be blessed. If the oneness between a husband and wife is not damaged, the family will be blessed. If the oneness in the church is not damaged, the church will also be blessed, even if there are no gifted persons in the church. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would be on guard against these ten worms. Then the church will dwell together in oneness and receive the God-commanded blessing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

TO PERFECT THE SAINTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:2, 9; 1 Pet. 5:1-3</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLES AND THE ELDERS<br />
DOING THE SAME THING</h2>
<p>We usually make a clear distinction between the apostles and the elders. The apostles are for all the localities, but the elders are for one locality. The apostles are universal, but the elders are local. On one hand, it is appropriate to make a clear distinction between the apostles and the elders, but on the other hand, we need to guard against an inaccurate and distorted understanding. Both the apostles and the elders shepherd the flock of God and build up the church. These two groups of people do the same thing. The elders should be able to do what the apostles do. The elders carry out what the apostles do and continue what the apostles have done.</p>
<p>We need a clear explanation of the office of the apostles and the office of the elders. In an attempt to understand these two offices, most people tend to make them distinct and separate, but this is not the proper understanding of the truth. My head and body are distinct, but they cannot be separated, for if they were separated, my life would be over. In understanding the truth, we should keep in mind that the different aspects and points of the truth must not be separated. However, it is wrong if no distinction is made between the different aspects and points of the truth. This can be compared to saying that there is no distinction between the head and the body or between the eyebrows and the eyes. Nevertheless, the truth should not be cut apart, just as the head and the body should not be separated.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there is a distinction between what the apostles do and what the elders do. On the other hand, however, according to my experience and observation over the years, these two groups of people do the same thing. If the apostles have time, they should do what the elders do. If the apostles do not have time, the elders are needed to carry out and complete what the apostles do not have the time to do. For this reason, a person can be both an elder and an apostle. Peter was such a person; he was both an apostle and an elder (1 Pet. 1:1; 5:1), because the apostles and the elders do the same thing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLES AND THE ELDERS<br />
PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>The human mind is very troublesome. Sometimes it does not know how to discern the truth, but at other times it is too exact in defining the truth. People think that the apostles are superior and have more authority and that the elders are subject to the authority of the apostles. The common thought is that the apostles are superior and that the elders are inferior. However, according to the words of the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of Mark, no believer is superior or inferior. Whoever wants to be first shall be the slave of all (10:44). Nevertheless, in Christianity&mdash;and even among us&mdash;apostles are exalted to a lofty status. Therefore, no one dares to say that he is an apostle, because the apostles are too high.</p>
<p>Contrarily, people regard the elders as being inferior to the apostles but superior to other believers. As a result, a brother who becomes an elder in a local church is regarded as a high-ranking official who is second only to the emperor. We need to knock down this wrong concept so that we can have a clear understanding of the truth. Every believer can be an apostle. For example, even though students do not teach, they can become teachers when they graduate. In the same principle, every believer in the church can become an apostle.</p>
<p>Apostles travel to different places in order to perfect the saints to do what the apostles do, just as teachers perfect students to become teachers. A math teacher should perfect his students to understand math and to be able to teach math in the future. If forty students graduate from a class, there should be forty math teachers in the future. Likewise, after an apostle works in a place for a few years, many believers should be perfected as apostles. Hence, whether a person is an apostle does not depend on a title or a position but on his being and function. A believer who is able to perfect the saints is an apostle, and a believer who is not able to perfect the saints is not an apostle.</p>
<p>Similarly, every brother can be an elder, and every brother must be an elder. If there are only three elders in a church and the rest of the brothers are considered to be &ldquo;small potatoes,&rdquo; that church is in a pitiful condition. I hope that one day there will be many brothers as elders in one church. However, not everyone needs to be an elder, because if everyone were mature and could be an elder, it would mean that there are no new believers. If a school has only teachers but no students, the school is not doing well, because it implies that the students do not want to be there. A successful school will have many teachers and many students. No matter where the co-workers go, they should expect that the brothers will become apostles. This is what it means to perfect the saints. If the apostles and the elders cannot produce &ldquo;graduates,&rdquo; the church will have no future.</p>
<p>The apostles, the elders, and the believers are the same. The apostles travel to places in order to help the believers become apostles, just as teachers help students to become teachers. The word <em>apostle</em> does not bear a lofty connotation. In Greek the word for <em>apostle</em> means a &ldquo;sent one.&rdquo; Apostles are sent by God. However, we have developed the thought of organization and hierarchy because we have been poisoned by the wrong concept in Christianity, and we consider the apostles to be high-ranking officials. The Catholic Church exalted the apostle Peter to the status of the pope. However, both the apostles and the elders should be slaves. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant&rdquo; (Matt. 20:26), and Peter says that the elders should not lord it over their allotments but should be patterns of the flock (1 Pet. 5:3).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS SHEPHERDING AND TEACHING</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that the work of the elders is to shepherd the flock of God and to teach the children of God (v. 2; 1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17; Titus 1:9). In order to shepherd and teach the children of God, the elders must be right in their person. When the New Testament speaks of the elders, its focus is on the person being right and unreprovable (1 Tim. 3:2-7; Titus 1:6-9). Being unreprovable does not mean that they do not make mistakes but that they do not need to be reproved. Paul says that the deacons must hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience (1 Tim. 3:8-9). A pure conscience is an inward matter, but being unreprovable is an outward matter. The elders should be unreprovable in the eyes of men, and the elders should have a pure conscience that is free of offense.</p>
<p>In addition, the elders must hold the mystery of the faith. Our faith has a twofold mystery: Christ is the embodiment of God, and the church is the expression of Christ. The mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4-6). This is the mystery of our faith. Every believer among us must know and hold this mystery. The elders and the deacons and deaconesses must have a thorough knowledge and understanding of the mystery of the faith. They should hold it and be able to share it with others.</p>
<p>The shepherding of the flock of God by the elders includes caring and feeding, just as a shepherd takes care of the sheep and feeds them so that they dwell securely and are satisfied. The elders also need to teach the saints. Not only should the elders give a message on a weekly basis, but they should also teach the saints on a daily basis. Do the elders in the localities shepherd and teach the saints? Or do they merely make arrangements, reach decisions, give announcements, and sign papers? If the elders are involved with the latter, they are not serving as elders but are acting as officials. The function of the elders is to perfect the saints so that the saints can eventually do what the apostles do. If the elders shepherd the saints in their locality, take care of them, feed them, and teach them, the condition of the saints will change year after year, and the church will be appreciated in that locality. Those who have a heart for the Lord will be drawn to the church and desire the church. However, the churches are nearly empty because many elders are not functioning as elders. People neither respect nor desire the church, and many promising young people leave the church for something else. The young people who are discouraged by the function of the elders have little appreciation for the church and feel that the church is not attractive and may eventually love the world.</p>
<p>If we do not have a fundamental change, our running will be in vain, our work will be to no avail, and the church will have no future. Our situation will be like a stream of water with sulfur in it. If the source of sulfur is not cut off, the water will inevitably have sulfur. We need to repent. This word is to the co-workers and the elders as well as to myself. Even though we have the right ground, the right way, and the riches of the divine life, if our person is wrong, what we do will also be wrong. As a result, the saints will have no regard for us, and we will not deserve their respect. Hence, I am entreating us to consecrate ourselves to the Lord in a fresh way and to give everything for the church of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A STRONG SPIRIT AND<br />
MUCH PRAYER IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We need to live in our spirit all the time, just as we need to breathe all the time. We do not have certain places where we breathe and certain places where we do not breathe. We come to the meetings to breathe. Therefore, instead of waiting for others, we should be strong in our spirit, actively exercising and releasing our spirit, and we must pray much. The meeting is ours; hence, everyone should open his mouth to pray. Every meeting is our assembling together; it is a time for us to pray with our spirit. Everyone should pray in the meetings. We must practice this.</p>
<p>Our meetings are open, and we have the spirit and life. Hence, we should be aggressive to pray one after another. In contrast, our meetings are abnormal, because they are full of regulations and rituals, and they lack the aggressiveness of the spirit and the spontaneity of life. In the United States when the co-workers and elders gather together, they only pray. They do not care whether there is a speaker in the meeting; they only care to pray aggressively. Everyone prays, and there are no pauses. We have gathered from various places to seek the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Hence, it is proper for us to pray instead of relying on a message. All the churches need to receive grace from the Lord in order to have a drastic change.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS PERFECTING OTHERS,<br />
NOT LORDING IT OVER THEM</h2>
<p>Concerning the service of the elders, in some places the elders have become everything in the church. They must be consulted for every matter, and everything depends upon their decision. This is too much. There should not be hierarchy among the believers. We are all brothers. There cannot be only one or two people in a local church. In a church with a few hundred or a few thousand people, there is the need for a few responsible ones to take the lead and to make arrangements concerning the church affairs. The Lord does not want a disorderly situation among His children. Therefore, the principle in the Bible shows that the elders are needed in the local churches. It is right for the brothers and sisters to obey the elders, but this does not mean that the elders are the officials in the local churches. It is wrong for the elders to be more overbearing than officials.</p>
<p>The elders are appointed by the apostles, but they should not think that they are elders only because they were appointed by the apostles. It is wrong for the elders to have such a bureaucratic and hierarchical view. The elders need to be appointed by the apostles, because those who are weighty are usually humble and do not fight to be first, whereas those who are insignificant want to be first. The apostles, who have spent much time with the Lord and are led by Him, need to appoint the elders; otherwise, the insignificant ones would rise up to be elders, and the proper persons would humbly retreat. Hence, the elders need to be appointed by the apostles. However, we should not have the concept that the apostles are popes appointing officials. There is no such practice in the church. Whether a brother should be an elder is between him and the Lord. Every saint has received a different measure of grace to fulfill his function and portion.</p>
<p>It is beautiful for the elders&rsquo; shepherding, teaching, and care to cover every detail and aspect of the church life. This is necessary. In some localities, however, every matter requires the elders&rsquo; approval. In many churches most of the affairs have been in the hands of the elders for ten or even twenty years. There is no building up in these localities. The elders should not keep anything in their hands; instead, they should commit everything to the deacons. The function of the elders is to oversee, not to handle things directly. The common problem among the elders is that they keep things in their hands and take care of things themselves; they do not allow others to be responsible. If there are a few who find favor with the elders, the elders will arrange for them to handle some matters. This, however, is not the church; this is not the building.</p>
<p>Building the church may be likened to building a house or making a piece of furniture. As long as the materials are available, they should be put to use, regardless of their size or value. Any person who is not put to use in a locality will become a problem, just like unused materials at a construction site that are heaped in a pile and become a problem. Some elders blame the saints for being material of poor quality. What kind of material is good? In order to build up the church, we need to use all kinds of materials. The larger ones are useful, and the smaller ones are useful. The ones whom we consider to be valuable are useful, and the ones whom we consider to be less valuable are also useful. However, if these materials are left on the ground, they will become a problem. When all the materials are used for the building, there will be no problem.</p><h2 class="head1">BRINGING ALL SAINTS INTO FUNCTION</h2>
<p>The elders can always come up with reasons for not putting people to use. Based on these excuses, no one can be used. Hence, the saints are set aside. The elders must bring the saints to the right track by perfecting them. A piece of wood cannot become a door by itself. It requires a carpenter to work on it before it can be installed into a building. This is the meaning of perfecting. The more the elders bring the saints into function, the fewer problems there will be in the church. The materials that are used to make furniture will not become a problem.</p>
<p>In building up the church, it is critical for the elders to use all the different kinds of materials, regardless of whether they are good. Sometimes, the well-behaved saints cannot carry out a task, but the naughty ones can carry out the task. The function of the saints depends on how the elders perfect them and build them up. The elders need to perfect, shepherd, and teach the saints and then assign responsibility for things to the saints. The elders need to identify the things that need to be done in order to assign them to the saints so that the saints can function.</p>
<p>The elders should not think that they are the only ones able to do things. Many young people are full of potential and will eventually do things better than the elders. There is a Chinese saying: &ldquo;There are only champion trainees but not champion trainers.&rdquo; A trainer may not be a champion himself, but one of his trainees may become a champion. Therefore, the elders need to let the saints develop by giving them opportunities to serve. Our problem is that many people are not built up but are &ldquo;piled up&rdquo; on the side. They have nothing to do, so they just gossip about the elders and about the church. The elders cannot blame them, because the elders do not give them anything to do. These ones have too much time, so they gossip. The elders need to build up the saints so that they function and bear responsibility. When the saints bear responsibility, they will not have time to gossip.</p>
<p>I have learned a basic secret from my many years of service in the church. If someone criticizes something, let him do it. For instance, if someone says that the glass windows were not thoroughly cleaned, he can be put in charge of cleaning and be given a chance to do it. This will help him to stop criticizing. If he does not do as good a job, his condition will be exposed. If he does a better job, his ability will be manifested. We should not prohibit those who criticize from doing things. If a person complains that the message was poor, he can be asked to give a message the next Lord&rsquo;s Day. When he gives the message, either his poverty will be exposed, or his riches will be manifested. The principle is that we should do our best to bring people into function.</p>
<p>The elders should not consider themselves to be in a higher position, nor should they consider themselves to be the authority for every decision. It is bureaucratic and authoritarian to set aside those who &ldquo;disobey.&rdquo; The Lord has commissioned me to minister life and truth to the churches and the saints. The churches have the freedom to decide what they want to do and how they will develop. There are more than three hundred churches on six continents. Not one church is in my hand. I live in Anaheim, but I do not know about many matters in the church in Anaheim. Some may even think that I am not a member of the church in Anaheim, because I am unaware of many things in the church there; these matters are in the hands of the elders. Every church should have the opportunity to develop, and the elders should allow the saints the opportunity to develop.</p>
<p>It is easy for the elders to conduct themselves as officials. In some situations it is better not to have elders, because they cause the church to suffer. In Revelation the Lord does not mention elders in the local churches. I believe that at the time of Revelation, people viewed the eldership as a system and the elders as officials. Hence, the Lord does not mention the elders or deacons in the local churches. The Lord seems to be saying, &ldquo;We do not need the elders to be officials. Instead, My people need the opportunity to develop, to live in the spirit, and to follow the spirit at all times.&rdquo; Some have a wrong concept and do not pray in a meeting when they feel that the meeting is under a certain elder brother&rsquo;s leadership. This should not be practiced. We are all brothers and sisters and should fulfill our functions in the meetings.</p>
<p>The elders in some local churches are like kings who give orders to the saints at will. This is entirely improper. As much as possible, the elders should assign the affairs of the church to the saints. The elders need to oversee instead of replacing the saints. When I hand things over to the saints, I often find that they do a better job. They can do what I could not do. Every person is limited; we have only two hands. May the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood cover me to say that although I have done many things, everything is now in others&rsquo; hands. The elders must learn how to perfect the saints. If the elders think that there is no &ldquo;good&rdquo; material, they should still use the &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; materials. A coffee table does not need to be made of valuable material; it can be made of ordinary wood.</p>
<p>If the elders cannot lead the saints to function, everyone standing idle will become a problem. Those standing idle will turn to idle words, which will turn into problems. The elders need to perfect the saints and allow them to fulfill their portion within their measure. At the same time, the elders should supply the saints with life and pray for them so that they may learn the lessons of life. If the saints are built up in this way, there will be no more problems.</p>
<p>The problem is that the elders think too highly of themselves. Every person is confident. However, I have learned to do things against my nature and not trust in myself but to commit things to others and teach them to do things. I once asked a sister to take care of a matter; she handled it in a better way, so I told her to do it her way because it was better. The elders must do this if they want to perfect the saints and build them up. If everything is held in the hands of the elders, the church will not develop.</p>
<p>We must help the saints realize that the elders do not have to approve everything that they do. The elders may not have the feeling to preach the gospel, but they should not discourage or restrict the saints who have earnestly received a burden for the gospel. Rather, the elders should encourage all the saints to preach the gospel. Not everything needs a stamp of approval from the elders. That is not the Body. The Body is of life and in the spirit.</p>
<p>There have always been those who love to be first (cf. 3 John 9), but the elders should not be such. Those who love to be first think that by exercising strict control they prevent chaos in the church. There have been some who caused problems, but most believers will not cause problems. Therefore, the saints should be free to function. Among the Lord&rsquo;s disciples, only one was Judas. The elders do not need to worry that everyone will be like Judas.</p>
<p>Let me repeat, the elders should not hold things in their hands. If a person is able to do a great thing, let him do it. If a person is able to do a small thing, let him do it. Even a person who is unable to do anything should do something, because he will learn. No one knows everything or is able to do everything from birth. Experience is acquired through learning. If a person makes a mistake, give him more chances. He will not always make mistakes; his mistakes are not on purpose. Hence, the elders need a large heart and much prayer. The elders are shepherds, so they should pray for the saints by name. In particular, they should pray for those who do not know how to do things and for those who may cause problems. The elders are busy, and they should make others busy as well. If only the elders are busy while the others stand idle, the church is not being built up.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS NEEDING<br />
TO PRAY MUCH AND TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is not easy to be an elder, because being an elder requires much prayer, learning, teaching, and fellowship. The elders need to fellowship with the saints every day and lead them one by one. The elders should fellowship with and lead one brother today and should fellowship with and lead another brother tomorrow. Then the work of the elders will be effective because brothers will learn how the elders lead the church. This is the way for the saints to be perfected.</p>
<p>Some churches might not have any offspring; in other words, they might not have a second generation. I am afraid that the elders in these localities do not care for people, nor do they pray much, and when they pray, they pray only about problems. This cannot produce offspring. We should not pray concerning the problems of the saints; rather, we should pray for them to be perfected. We should be able to bring the saints into their function, to perfect them, and to build them up. The extent of building up depends on the growth of life, and the growth of life depends on how well a person is fed. If parents do a good job of feeding their children, the children will grow up. Hence, there must be no officials, no self-assumed authority, and no rulers if a local church is to be built up. The Bible says that the elders should not lord it over the allotment entrusted to them by God but should be patterns of the flock (1 Pet. 5:3).</p>
<p>If the Lord permits, some local churches could practice having no elders for a period of time so that every brother has the opportunity to advance and develop. I am making this proposal because in some localities the eldership has become a system, and the saints have lost their inner spiritual sense. This is not right. If this situation continues, organizations and regulations will be formed among us. The responsible brothers and the elders must understand that they are not officials; they are merely brothers and slaves serving the church.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the elders should live in their spirit and pray much. Everything related to the church should pass through prayer; nothing should be done without prayer. If the restrooms need to be cleaned, the elders should pray, &ldquo;Lord, which brother should be put in charge of cleaning the restrooms?&rdquo; Arrangements can be made after prayer. The elders should bear every saint in prayer and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading on behalf of the saints. Then the elders will receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading and know how to lead the saints, including where to place them in the service. This is building. Materials cannot install themselves into a house; they must be built into the house by the builders, according to the need. This is what the elders should do.</p>
<p>The elders should not rule or lord it over people. We should not say, &ldquo;The elders are the authority in the church. Only what they say counts.&rdquo; A brother with this thought should not be an elder. The service and responsibility of the elders are to cultivate the saints, develop their spiritual life, and activate their spiritual function. The elders do not need to rule. Only the Lord Himself is the ruling One. He reigns in everyone. The elders only need to bring the saints into the spirit.</p>
<p>A good elder must be a person of prayer and a person living in the spirit. If a person does not know what it means to live in the spirit or to pray, he will not and cannot be an elder. A person who lives in the spirit and prays at all times will not contact the saints or arrange matters, things, and persons in the church until he has had thorough prayer. Such a person is able to bring others into the spirit of prayer and into fellowship and to build them up in life. The church is not a society that needs socializing. Secular interactions and socializing are the customs of the nations and are filthy leprosy. Only those who pray themselves into the spirit can build up the church and shepherd the church.</p>
<p>If the brothers are to be elders, they must learn this lesson. We must learn to live in the spirit and to pray. If we live in the spirit and pray concerning every matter, we will be different, and the church will also be different.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO ADMINISTRATE THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:15-16</h1>
<p>Ephesians 4:15-16 shows how the Body of Christ is built up and how the co-workers and the elders work and administrate the church. The way indicated in Ephesians is clear and practical.</p>
<p>In a previous chapter we saw that Psalm 133 reveals oneness as the basic condition for us to receive blessing and life. Oneness brings in the blessing of life and the supply of the eternal life. We saw that the elders, deacons, and co-workers should know and hold the mystery of the faith and be able to speak it to others. This is how they shepherd the flock of God and teach the saints. To shepherd is to take care of people, to feed and supply them with life. To teach is to cultivate people to be full-grown and useful. We also saw that the elders in the various localities must learn to build every saint into the Body. The saints should be built into the Body according to their condition, not according to the expectations of the elders. The &ldquo;good&rdquo; saints are useful for the building, and the &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; saints are also useful. Everyone should be brought into the building. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we see this light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT ADMINISTRATING THE CHURCH<br />
IN A NATURAL WAY</h2>
<p>There is a stark difference between the revelation in the Bible and our past practices. Please forgive me for saying this: The elders often use natural methods to administrate and lead the churches. We have natural methods and the natural element. Most elders are in the natural man. Whether or not we are smart is of no value. The smarter a person is, the more stubborn and self-confident he is. It is easy for a brother to bring his intelligence into the church, because he thinks that he has a superior way of handling matters. To bring one&rsquo;s natural intelligence into the administration of the church is not only useless but also exceedingly harmful to the church. Our natural intelligence is a worm that gradually erodes the building of the church. Furthermore, our natural intelligence is a stronghold that can be broken only by the Lord&rsquo;s light. Therefore, we need to be subdued by the light of God.</p>
<p>We should be cautious in the appointment of elders in a local church. Most people think that a brother who loves and seeks the Lord and who is prominent and smart can be appointed as an elder. However, the foolish ones should not be elders, nor should the smart ones be elders. Foolish ones can do many foolish things, but smart ones can do things that damage the church. The foolish things that foolish ones do in the church are obvious, but the smart ones damage the church in a hidden way, because the things that they do are cloaked by their smartness. Our intelligence is of no use in the administration of the church. The church is built up not by intelligence but by the growth of the divine life. Being smart hinders the growth of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO USE ONLY SMART ONES BEING A NATURAL WAY</h2>
<p>In the administration of the church it is not right for the elders to hold everything in their hands and do everything themselves; they must trust others. The elders are overseers; hence, they should commit everything to others and ask others to do things. It is not easy for the smart elders to commit things to others. The smarter a person is, the less he is willing to trust others or to let others do things. When a smart person does things, he is confident in himself and therefore holds things in his hands, and according to his preference, he treasures those who also are smart. If an elder is smart, he will treasure smart materials; he will hunt for the smart ones in the church and commit things to these ones. Because smart people do things quickly, smart elders look for smart people to do things in a smart way. In the eyes of a smart elder, the people who are not smart are foolish. As a result, the smart ones will consider themselves to be superior to the other saints in the church. They may think that only the smart ones can administrate the church and be in charge of the church. Even though they may not say this aloud, they bear such an air and flavor.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, smart elders are not smart, but they think that they are smart. Such elders do not possess much wisdom; rather, they have a form of cleverness. There are not that many naturally wise or smart ones in the church, because God chose the foolish things of the world (1 Cor. 1:26-27). The elders should not blame the saints, nor should they blame God, saying, &ldquo;Why did You create so many foolish people? Why do You save so many foolish ones? There are many clever people in society, but very few are in the church. Lord, why did You not add more clever ones to the church?&rdquo; First Corinthians 1:26 says clearly that among those whom God saves, &ldquo;there are not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful,&rdquo; but He has chosen the foolish ones. An elder may say, &ldquo;Lord, You saved the foolish ones; how can I administrate the church?&rdquo; The Lord would answer, &ldquo;These are the ones who will enable you to grow in life. These are the ones who will allow you to lead them to grow in life. Do not think that you are clever; rather, come down from your throne of intelligence and be foolish instead! Only foolish ones can lead other foolish ones and grow together with other foolish ones. I want some foolish ones in the church to make you foolish so that you can grow.&rdquo; This is God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>The elders need to lead the church in a way that is different from the way people do things in society. The elders need to bring everyone into serving, to put everyone to use. In society the capable ones are valued and promoted, but the incapable ones are ignored and put aside. It is pitiful that such a worldly practice has been brought into many local churches.</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING EVERYONE IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The elders should not administrate the church in the way that people do things in society. The church is not administrated in that way. In the church everyone who seems foolish in our eyes must be put to use; such a one can learn to wipe the chairs. The more foolish a person seems, the more we should welcome and treasure him. He may make a mess the first time he cleans the chairs, but we should not give up. We should teach him and ask him to clean the chairs again. If he does not succeed the first week, we can help him the next week. Although he learns things slowly, we must not put him aside, for once he knows how to do it, he will be faithful, and we can fully depend on him. Those who seem to be foolish do not play clever tricks and do not have gimmicks. We may need to spend four or five weeks to teach them, but they will save us much trouble in the future. Those who consider themselves smart like to play tricks. They may do a good job in our presence, but in our absence they will change everything we taught them. Therefore, the smart ones are not that reliable, but the foolish ones are. This is particularly true in the church. This might be the reason that the Lord does not save so many smart ones. The Lord does not have a way with those who consider themselves to be smart. Although the foolish ones learn things slowly, they are very reliable.</p>
<p>The local churches cannot be built up in a short time. If there are one hundred and twenty people in a locality, we will need at least three years to build up everyone and bring them into serving. The way to build up the church differs from the methods of society. Society depends on elections, and only talented ones can win elections. In the church everyone must be put to use. The more the elders ask the saints to bear responsibility and do things, the more involved the saints will be. When the saints do things in the church, they will be interested in the church, love the church, and care for the church, because they feel that they have a part in the church. If the elders do not let the saints do things, the saints will feel useless and indifferent and will lose their interest in the church.</p>
<p>We cannot build up the church with the methods used in society. The church and society are completely different entities. Smart ones cannot gain fame or profit in the church, and the Lord has saved many foolish ones. Therefore, the elders should not consider themselves smart. Those who are competent to be elders live in their spirit, pray at all times, and minister life. They are able to bring all the children of God, regardless of how foolish they appear to be, into serving, to teach and perfect them, and to commit things to them. By such a process both the elders and the saints will grow together in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING REALITY INSTEAD OF FALSE THINGS</h2>
<p>We also need to see that the church is built up by growing in life. Paul says, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 4:15). <em>Truth</em> here refers to the things that are true and real. We do not want false things or vanity in the church; we want only what is true and real. Caring for physical appearance, playing politics, and treating people not according to our spirit are false things. Therefore, we do not play tricks or politics. Paul also says, &ldquo;Having put off the lie, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another&rdquo; (v. 25). We do not care for false things, pretense, or methods. We should not treat others with hypocrisy; rather, we must hold to truth in love. Then we will grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWING UP INTO THE HEAD, CHRIST, IN ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>In the administration of the church the elders must always be genuine with one another and toward others; they must be without pretense. The elders must also grow up into Christ in all things, whether big or small. We were put into Christ when we were saved. However, we have not yet grown up into Christ in many aspects of our living. Hence, we need to grow up into Christ in all things. This means we should not do anything apart from Christ; we should do everything in Christ. We should not choose the color or style of our clothing apart from Christ. Before we were saved, we were outside of Christ and followed the trend and fashion of the world. Now that we are saved, we should buy our clothes in Christ, spend money in Christ, and do things in Christ. This is what it means to grow up into Christ in all things. Then we will experience verse 16: &ldquo;Out from whom [Christ] all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A crucial point in the administration of the church is that the elders must not give up on any brother or sister. Nearly every locality has neglected this point. When the elders pray and fellowship concerning the needs of the church, they discover that the church has many needs, but they cannot find the people who will serve. However, it is not that the elders cannot find people but that they cannot find the people whom they think are useful. There are many saints, but the elders feel that this brother is not qualified and that sister is not up to the standard. For example, the elders may want the saints to praise God but feel that no one is competent, because everyone seems to be either &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; or &ldquo;deaf.&rdquo; If all the saints are dumb, the elders should still pray and inquire of the Lord how to lead the saints. If the saints are incompetent, the elders should be constrained to pray. Then the elders will take the lead to grow in life. After the elders are dealt with by the Lord, they should ask for the Lord&rsquo;s leading and guidance. Although a dumb person cannot speak, he can use sign language. The brothers should then learn &ldquo;sign language&rdquo; in order to teach the saints how to praise God. In this way no one is set aside, but everyone is brought into function. This is the proper way to build up the church. In order to bring the saints into serving, the elders need to pray patiently and teach and perfect the saints. We must not give up on anyone, because the saints are children of God; they were created and redeemed by God. If God treasures them, how can we abandon them? If we as elders have the attitude of letting the saints go, after a few years there will be no one but the elders left to praise God.</p>
<p>In some local churches the elders put everything, including the keys to the meeting hall, in their pocket. As a result, no one functions except the elders. This is unacceptable. The brothers must remember that they should never put any brother or sister aside. It is a gross error to put the saints aside. To put the saints aside is to abandon God&rsquo;s creation and the Lord&rsquo;s redemption. God did not make a mistake in creating the saints, nor did the Lord make a mistake in redeeming them. Hence, we must bring all the believers into serving and perfect them to function. I can testify that if we know how to administrate the church, every saint will be precious. In the eyes of the outsiders, we are all foolish people who are cleaning the hall, and we are dumb ones who cannot sing but who use sign language to express our praise. In such a process of administrating the church, we will grow in life, and we will be able to minister life so that others may also grow in life.</p>
<p>The only way for the elders to minister life, to help others to grow in life, and to perfect others is not to consider anyone useless but to bring everyone into serving. Then the elders will have the way and will gain the experience. We will be the first to grow in life, and then we can help others to also grow in life.</p>
<p>It is our hope and prayer that some in every local church will rise up to lay a good foundation. This way may be hard initially, but eventually everyone will follow this way. In some local churches no &ldquo;graduates&rdquo; have been produced for many years, because the elders administrate the church in a natural way and have not learned this lesson. In a natural way we do not trust others, we think that we are the only capable ones, and we do everything ourselves. This way must change. We must not take the natural way. Instead, we should take the way that is based on the Word of God and bring the children of God, one by one, into serving so that they can function. If we do this for one day, we will gain one day&rsquo;s worth of learning, and if we do this for one year, we will gain one year&rsquo;s worth of learning. We will gain many experiences. If we will carry this out, those who come after us will spontaneously follow the same path. Although this is hard at the beginning, it will be easy for others to follow.</p><h2 class="head1">BEARING THE PROBLEMS OF THE SAINTS<br />
BY GROWING UP INTO CHRIST</h2>
<p>The elders must learn to bear the problems of the saints. Sometimes our shepherding of the saints causes us much trouble, and sometimes we need to help the saints who are in trouble. The only way to bear such situations is to grow up into Christ. Some saints love the church and are righteous, always doing things in a righteous way. When such a saint sees an elder doing things in an inappropriate way, he may deliberately make things difficult for the elder. The only way to handle such a situation is to pray and ask the Lord to open a way. This is what it means to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things (cf. Eph. 4:15). We should not blame the saints for being troublesome, nor should we play tricks or use politics to solve the problems. This is to use methods that are outside of Christ. We need to bring every problem before the Lord. When we go to the Lord, we will experience the growth in life.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother seeks advice because his wife is a burden to him. When the brother consults us regarding his wife, we should not set him aside by saying, &ldquo;Brother, bear the cross! Romans 8:28 says that all things work together for good to those who love God.&rdquo; Such clich&#233;s are ineffective. The elders are shepherds. When sheep are in trouble, the shepherds are like parents with children; we cannot throw Romans 8:28 at them. When a child cannot find a way out, the parents need to take responsibility. When the saints do not know how to go on, the elders need to take responsibility. Therefore, when a brother tells us his problems, we should bear the responsibility and say, &ldquo;Brother, let us pray together. I will pray for you, and you should pray too. Let us ask the Lord to lead us.&rdquo; We should bring the burden to the Lord. We may say, &ldquo;Lord, You saved this brother and his wife, but they cannot get along. Lord, how should I help him from the perspective of life?&rdquo; When we pray, we are the first person to learn the lesson. We will realize that we do not treat our spouse in a proper way. The brother&rsquo;s problem exposes our problem. Then we will learn the lesson before the Lord and be dealt with by the Lord. After this we should pray with the brother again, and we will minister to him what we have learned, and he will be supplied. As a result, the Body will grow. The elders take the lead to grow, and the saints follow the elders to grow. This principle applies to dealing with the problems of the saints. We cannot use doctrines to set people aside. We must bear the problems of the saints and regard their problems as our own problems by bringing their problems to the Lord and seeking the Lord&rsquo;s way in prayer.</p>
<p>If the elders administrate the church and lead and care for people in life, the saints will grow in life. The elders will grow in life, and the saints will receive the life supply and grow in life. The whole church will grow together under such leadership of the elders. On the one hand, the elders will bring the saints into serving, and on the other hand, the elders will bring the saints&rsquo; problems before the Lord in prayer. Through such prayer the elders will obtain the experiences of life and will be able to help the saints grow. If this is our practice, after a few years every aspect of the church will be glorious. At present every locality lacks such building. If we have such building in the local churches, we will not need any gifts or eloquent speakers, nor will we need special conferences. The divine life will grow spontaneously.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS CHANGING THEIR WAYS</h2>
<p>Regrettably, our present situation has not changed, because the elders use natural ways to administrate the church. The elders hold everything related to service in their hands and do not trust others. As a result, the saints love the church but have no part in the service. The problem lies with the elders. If the elders will change, the church will have no problem. The elders need to trust the saints. The saints may initially make a mess of things, but eventually they will learn the lessons of life. The saints who are set aside and not brought into serving will complain and murmur. Such saints do not give up on the church, but the elders have set them aside. The saints who have problems should learn the lessons of life, but they will not know how to advance if the elders do not take the lead to learn the lessons of life. As a result, the church will not advance. If a senior co-worker is invited to give a conference every six months, there will only be excitement. After the co-worker leaves, the church will return to its original state.</p>
<p>We need to change our way of doing things. If the elders do not change, we have no way out. It is not impossible for us to change our ways. We must hold on to two points. First, we must not set any saint aside; even the ones who seem useless are useful. We should gradually bring every saint into serving. If the saints are functioning, they will find their home in the church and be happy. Second, we should consider every saint&rsquo;s problem as our own problem, just as parents consider their children&rsquo;s problems to be their problems. We should relate to the saints in this way, pray and inquire of the Lord concerning their problems, fellowship with the Lord, and be willing to be dealt with and enlightened. Then we will learn the lessons, and we will see a reflection of ourselves in their problems. Through the problems of the saints, we will understand our own problems.</p>
<p>If the elders take the lead to learn the lessons and to be dealt with by the Lord, the saints will follow to be dealt with and corrected by the Lord, which will result in the growth of life and the building. This is &ldquo;all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part&rdquo; (Eph. 4:16). If each one part functions, the Body will be knit together in a strong way, which will cause the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. I believe that we are able to experience this.</p>
<p>When I say that we do not need many conferences, I do not mean that we do not need the supply from the ministry. The church needs the supply. However, the conferences are merely a supply. The building up of the church depends on the elders perfecting the saints and helping the saints grow in life. Therefore, I hope that the elders in every locality will change their ways.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br />
CONCERNING CHURCH SERVICE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE LEADING IN THE SERVICE<br />
AND SUPPLYING LIFE</h2>
<p><em>Question: I would like to bring the new believers into serving, but they often refuse or decline. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This is a problem. A person who has not arrived at the stage of supplying life to others will have difficulty bringing others into serving. The church is not an organization; it is a Body. A body depends on life and is organic. Therefore, if we have not grown to a certain measure in life, it will be difficult for us to bring others in.</p>
<p>According to my observation, some elders have not entered into the genuine experience of life, which involves knowing the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, loving Him and fellowshipping with Him, and letting Him be our life so that we live, speak, and walk according to this life in our spirit. This is what it means to enter into the experience of life. The genuine experience of life is not a matter of improving the self, restricting the self, or cultivating the self. Rather, it is the Lord Jesus as the Spirit of life being our life in our spirit, and it is also our loving Him and fellowshipping with Him so that we walk by this life. This is a basic matter.</p>
<p>Some elders have not yet touched the experience of life. The saints might consider such an elder to be a good person who loves the Lord. However, such an elder is not living in the Lord as his life but lives outside of the divine life. His knowledge of the Bible and of the truth has become a factor of his Christian living that is a substitute for Christ; that is, his knowledge is not Christ. Every elder should be cautious of this.</p>
<p>In principle, we should bring every saint, regardless of whether he seems useful, into the service. We may accept this principle; however, if we do not have the experience of life, we may be humble, patient, and diligent to contact all the saints in order to bring them into serving, but our labor will be organizational. We must couple our labor with the supply of life and our own experience of life. In bringing the saints into the service, we must not only give them outward arrangements; we must also fellowship and pray with them to show them the way of life and to bring them into life so that they too may have experiences of life. In this way their service will not be merely outward arrangements but the operation of the life within them.</p>
<p>In order for a seed to grow, it must have life, and it must be planted in the soil. Planting is an arrangement. It is not fitting for a seed to be placed on a table or kept in a box; it must be taken out of the box and given some arrangements. First, the seed needs to be planted into the soil. If the soil is too hard, it must be plowed. If the soil is too dry, it must be watered. If the soil is not fertile, it must be fertilized. If the soil has weeds, it must be weeded. All these are arrangements. A person who knows how to make such arrangements is a good farmer who can work and cultivate the land. Of course, if we are dealing with a pebble or a grain of sand, all such arrangements would be in vain, because they lack life. Without life there can be no growth.</p>
<p>We make arrangements in the service for the saints because they are saved and have the Lord&rsquo;s life. We cannot guarantee that every person in the church is saved. I have encountered such situations. I once made arrangements for a person in the service, and he was willing to serve. But eventually I discovered that he was not yet saved and did not have the Lord&rsquo;s life. We should not cast such persons out but should immediately bring them to receive life by repenting, confessing their sins, believing in the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood, and praying to receive the Lord. Then they should be baptized. As soon as an elder realizes that someone is not yet regenerated, the elder must fellowship with him in order to supply him with life.</p>
<p>There are some who have the Lord&rsquo;s life, but when we touch them, we realize that they do not have enough life. We should contact these saints one by one to fellowship with them and supply them. When a housewife feeds her family, she needs to know what to serve the adults and what to serve the children. It is not so simple to be an elder; the basic factor is to have the experience of life and to supply life to others.</p>
<p>The elders may be willing to practice this fellowship, but if they are short of the divine life or of the experiences of life, they will not be successful. Hence, we must pursue the experience of life in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The Lord is our life; He is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit to be our life. Therefore, we must love Him and fellowship with Him to let Him live in us, and for us to live by Him.</p>
<p>Some elders are well-mannered and faithful; they love the church, serve willingly, and know the truth, but they lack the experience of life in spirit. Therefore, no matter how much we emphasize the need to be strong in spirit and to exercise our spirit, they are not affected. There are several reasons why such brothers are elders. They may have become responsible ones and then elders because they initiated the meeting of the church in their locality. They are saved, but they have not been led in life, nor have they had experiences of life. Some local churches are weak, and the saints do not know the experience of life. In such situations the responsible ones may not have had the proper condition, but there was no one better. Therefore, it is difficult for them to perfect others, because they themselves have not been perfected in life, nor do they have the experiences in life. This is the source of many problems. If we have genuine experiences in life, and we live in the spirit, there will be no problems. The elders have &ldquo;worms&rdquo; within them because they do not have enough life and do not spend enough time in the spirit.</p>
<p>Some have complained that the elders in one of the churches are not middle-aged brothers. I am concerned that if the middle-aged brothers were elders, they would fight with one another. I am not condemning the middle-aged brothers, but we need to be stirred up to come out of our self into life. If we do not enter into life and do not experience life, we will have only problems. Romans 7:18 says, &ldquo;I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being an elder is a matter in life. One cannot be a successful elder without being in life and in the spirit. The church is the Body of Christ, and the elders are members in the church. Life is needed in the Body. Wisdom and cleverness are of no avail to the Body. When the elders depart from the divine life, they are of no avail, and problems will eventually arise. Even a brother who is naturally meek and able to get along with others may not be successful as an elder. Meekness and the ability to get along with people are not enough. The most important thing is for an elder to be able to supply life. An elder who does not supply the saints with life is handicapped. A stone has no temper, no character, no preferences, no feelings, and no thoughts. Ten stones that are piled together will never quarrel; they will always &ldquo;get along.&rdquo; If they are not moved, the stones will &ldquo;get along&rdquo; for many years; they do not need life. Therefore, it is not sufficient for the elders to avoid quarreling and be amiable. The church needs the supply of life.</p>
<p>It is a shame that many elders do not have rich experiences of life and have not received genuine help in life; hence, they cannot supply people with the riches of the divine life. This is our fundamental shortcoming and a fundamental problem. Some say that the elders are not in harmony, but the reason for a lack of harmony is a lack of the divine life. Others say that the elders have too many opinions, but the reason for too many opinions is also because of a lack of the divine life. Still others say that the elders are not very clever. However, cleverness can only damage the church; it cannot build up the church. The elders who rely on their natural cleverness lack the divine life and do not pray enough. They do not live in the spirit, nor do they fellowship much with the Lord. They also lack fellowship with one another in the spirit of life. As a result, they lack wisdom and may even be slightly foolish. Our natural cleverness is absolutely of no worth. The church is the only place that can exhaust a person&rsquo;s cleverness. The church is capable of exhausting our natural cleverness and wisdom. The wisdom needed in the church is the wisdom of the divine life. Such wisdom of life is the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>The elders must have a basis in life in order to resolve the difficult problems that the church encounters. Matters of life are not quick. Life does not grow to maturity immediately after a person prays. A grain of wheat that is planted today will not sprout tomorrow. We must plow the soil, sow the grain of wheat, and wait for at least a week before it will sprout. Hence, if the elders do not experience life regularly, they will have no way to deal with the spiritual needs that arise. If the elders say, &ldquo;Wait for me to fast and pray for a week,&rdquo; it will be too late. Those who have experiences of life may receive the wisdom of the Holy Spirit from God after praying and fasting for a week, but those who do not have experiences of life might not receive the wisdom of the Holy Spirit, because they do not have a basis in life.</p>
<p>The basic need of the elders is the experience of life. If the elders have a basis in life, they will not rely on their cleverness or natural wisdom when the church encounters a problem; instead, they will bring the matter to the Lord in prayer. Furthermore, they will not only pray personally but will also fellowship and pray together with their fellow elders. They will ask the Lord to anoint them with His feeling and to enlighten them to deal with the problem and to resolve it. Only the sense, understanding, and leading that come out of the divine life are genuine wisdom. This is altogether different from natural cleverness. In administrating the church, the elders must first have a basis in life. With this basis they should pray, fellowship, and wait, instead of relying on their natural cleverness and wisdom. By relying on our natural cleverness and wisdom, we nullify the experiences of life.</p>
<p>Although in our service in the church we do need to help the saints know what is proper, the main need is still the experience of life. A brother who does not have the experiences of life should not be an elder and is not capable of being an elder, because the function of an elder is to supply life. How can he be an elder if he does not have the experiences of life and is not able to supply life? If a mathematics teacher does not know mathematics, how can he teach others? The elders should be able to supply life. If an elder is short of the divine life or the experiences of the divine life, he will not know how to deal with the needs according to life when they arise. Because he is not able to supply life, he can employ only diplomacy and methods, which will give rise to more problems.</p>
<p>If an elder does not have the experiences of life, his leading the saints to function will have no outcome, because there will be no supplying of life to others. We bring people in and teach them to maintain their position and receive the supply of life. Hence, we must know not only how to make arrangements and lead the saints but also how to supply them with life. In the West when a waiter sets the dining table, he sets one glass at each place. The glass is for water. If a glass is set but no water is poured into it, the setting of the glass is meaningless. A glass set on the table cannot quench a person&rsquo;s thirst; only water can quench a person&rsquo;s thirst. But in order for water to be poured into a glass, there must first be the arrangement of setting the glass. The elders need two aspects in administrating and building up the church. On the one hand, whether or not the saints seem useful, the elders should bring them into function so that they can find their proper place. On the other hand, the elders must fellowship with the saints one by one in order to supply them with life. These two aspects require the experience of life, without which the elders cannot administrate or build the church.</p>
<p>I hope that the brothers who are elders will turn to the Lord and pursue the experiences of life. Without these experiences the service of the elders is empty, and problems will be unavoidable. However, when we have the experiences of life, life will swallow up death, and the problems will disappear.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO COORDINATE WITH THE SAINTS</h2>
<p><em>Question: I will soon be forty years old. How exactly can I have better coordination with the brothers in the church in order to be a good testimony? The brothers feel that I am disobedient. I have prayed concerning this, but this is my natural disposition. Whenever I am not in the spirit, problems arise. What should I do?<em></p>
<p>Answer: We always expect everything in the church to be ideal. We want the elders to be like Peter, the apostles to be like Paul, and the saints to be like Timothy and Mary so that we can have better coordination. We think that we will have good coordination in an ideal church with ideal saints and ideal conditions. However, where in the universe can we find such an ideal church? Instead, there are &ldquo;donkeys,&rdquo; &ldquo;monkeys,&rdquo; &ldquo;chickens,&rdquo; &ldquo;dragonflies,&rdquo; &ldquo;birds,&rdquo; and &ldquo;beasts&rdquo; in the churches, and it is not easy to coordinate. We may want to coordinate with Peter, but instead we must coordinate with monkeys. We should not expect to have better coordination. Some saints expect to find better coordination, so they go from one place to another only to find that no place is as good as the first place. There is no ideal church on the earth.</p>
<p>No one can deny that you love the Lord. But because you love the Lord, you have a strong hope to pursue the ideal. Your love for the Lord supports you to be for the Lord and to want better coordination and a better testimony; hence, you hope to find a place on earth that is better than the New Jerusalem. We must understand that there is no such place. We must simply coordinate with the saints whom the Lord has measured out to us. If they are donkeys, we should coordinate with them; if they are monkeys, we should coordinate with them; if they are chickens, we should coordinate with them; and if they are angels, we should coordinate with them. We should be able to coordinate with anyone without distinction. This is our need. Otherwise, we will not find anyone on earth to coordinate with. God will not create an ideal environment for us. Would our coordination be needed in such an ideal church where the elders are like Peter, the apostles are like Paul, the brothers are like Timothy, and the sisters are like Mary? Would we be needed there?</p>
<p>We all have such a problem. Those who are in Manila want to go to Taipei, and those who are in Taipei want to go to Anaheim. But when they arrive in Anaheim, they sigh, saying that they must wait for the New Jerusalem, because Anaheim is no better than Taipei. I am afraid that they will even be disappointed in the New Jerusalem. It is for this reason that Brother Watchman Nee once said, &ldquo;If you cannot coordinate with those in the church in your locality, you cannot coordinate with anyone. If you want to learn the lesson, stay where you are; do not go to another place.&rdquo; If we cannot learn the lesson in one place, we will not learn it anywhere else. There is no ideal church, nor are there ideal elders. If there were such a situation, we would not be needed.</p>
<p>Concerning being disobedient, we all are disobedient by nature. However, you were disobedient because the brothers did not meet your demands or your standard. They rightly said that you are disobedient, but they did not understand that you are still dreaming of an ideal church with ideal elders. Therefore, your disobedience might not have been deliberate. I hope you will soon wake up from your unfulfillable dream.</p>
<p>You say that you will soon be forty years old. You are anxious that you will run out of time, but the Lord is more anxious than you are. However, the Lord is also patient and can wait for you to wake up from your dream. You love the Lord and are willing to pay the price; however, if you do not come out of your old temperament and old views, that is, wake up from your idealistic dream, you will make the Lord wait until you are sixty years old or even eighty years old.</p>
<p>We should not be idealistic; we are not yet in the new heaven and the new earth. Many of us have this problem. We should not think too much, nor should we expect too much. We should learn to praise and thank the Lord for where He has arranged for us to be. The elders are good, the brothers are good, and the sisters are good. Whether or not they are qualified is the Lord&rsquo;s business, not ours. We should learn to praise Him more.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLYGYNY,<br />
REMARRIAGE, AND SERVICE</h2>
<p><em>Question: Indonesia is a country that practices polygyny. Can a person who practices polygyny serve after he is saved?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This question is easy to answer. A polygynist can definitely serve after he is saved. The more he serves the better. However, he cannot be given an outward position, because his status of having more than one wife violates God&rsquo;s ordination. The principle in the Bible for an elder or a deacon is for him to be the husband of only one wife (1 Tim. 3:2, 12; Titus 1:6). Although this brother&rsquo;s status may not be right, we still need to give him the opportunity to serve, but it must be without a position. We must do our best to avoid giving him a position.</p>
<p>We should not pay much attention to position in the service of the church. Suppose a small church has nine sisters and six brothers, and each of the six brothers is divorced and remarried. The church still needs some of those brothers to be responsible ones, because there is no other way. However, if more brothers are gained for the testimony of the church, we need to find brothers with a simpler status to be responsible ones. The church is high and has high principles, and we should give people a good impression. However, there is no law. If possible, the elders and deacons in the church should have a clean status lest the reputation of the church be defiled or implicated. We do not need to focus on position, because the important thing in the service of the church is reality, not position.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT EMPHASIZING ARRANGEMENTS<br />
IN THE CHURCH SERVICE</h2>
<p><em>Question: In the past a sister offended many people in the service and later quit serving. She recently had a turn, and we would like to bring her back into service, but many sisters are opposed to this. What should we do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The basic problem in some churches is that too much emphasis is put on arrangements. There cannot be services in a local church without arrangements, but we must avoid emphasizing arrangements. It is as if people cannot serve without our arrangements. If we do not reduce the amount of such arrangements, it will become a hindrance to the service. If not for the emphasis on our arrangements, this sister could have begun serving as soon as she had a turn. If she has the burden to sweep the floor and clean the hall, she can sweep the floor and clean the hall. If she has the burden to serve the children, she can serve the children. Does she need permission to share or testify in the meeting? We must not turn the service of the church into an organization. A person does not need to pass through certain procedures before he can serve.</p>
<p>Some do not approve, because of their emphasis on arrangements. Approval and disapproval have no value in the church. It is not that Brother B can serve because Brother A approves or that Brother B cannot serve because Brother A does not approve. The value of our service depends on our fellowship with the Lord, our relationship with the Lord, and our burden from the Lord. If I have a burden from the Lord, I should sweep the floor when others approve and when others do not approve. If I have a burden from the Lord, I should testify when others approve and when others do not approve. Then the approving and disapproving voices in the church will be rendered useless. The organizational arrangement has created an atmosphere in which people&rsquo;s approval or disapproval is becoming influential. Such influence must be reduced. No one should say that he does not approve of a certain brother or sister serving. We must learn the lesson that our approving and disapproving should only be toward ourselves, not toward others. We should listen to messages for ourselves, not for others. In the church we must apply everything to ourselves; we must not point at others. Instead of criticizing others for not praying, we should pray more. We should praise the Lord if others pray and praise Him if others do not pray. The saints love the Lord. Their situation is not for us to judge. We can judge only ourselves.</p>
<p>We must create a healthy and proper atmosphere in the church and have a proper heart toward the saints. A sister might have been wrong in the past, but she might turn after a period of time. When she returns to serve, everyone should rejoice and be glad. It is dangerous for a person to quit serving, because he may leave the church forever. This sister did not leave the church, and she came back to serve. We should rejoice for her and give her another chance. Everyone should learn this lesson.</p>
<p>Whether or not a person is an elder or a co-worker, he should not judge others. Whether others are right or wrong, we should point only at ourselves, not at others. Although I should not rebuke the elders in the presence of others, I have the position and ground to rebuke the elders. Others may not have such a position. Therefore, they are wrong to convict the elders using my words.</p>
<p>We must not listen to these messages for others; we must listen to them for ourselves. If we would learn to fear the Lord and receive the grace to learn the lessons, the church will have a future. The future of the church depends on the saints and the elders. The future of the church is affected by our condition. Therefore, we must humbly ask the Lord to have mercy on us so that we would be willing to accept everything that He has spoken in these messages. We should take the condition of others as a warning and ask the Lord to have mercy on us so that we would learn the lessons and not repeat their condition. This is the proper spirit. The future of the church concerns us all; hence, we all must learn the lessons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING, HAVING A STRONG SPIRIT,<br />
AND SUPPLYING LIFE</h2>
<p><em>Question: There are only two elderly couples in our district. How can they serve?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This question is related to the previous one. There is a problem with the leading of the elders if the saints need to be asked to serve and coordinate in the church. The overall leading in the church should be for every saint, whether young or old, to serve. When everyone is serving, the saints can be given specific leading according to their situation. The elders should regularly give the church extensive and thorough leading. For example, a nation that maintains proper public health will be exempt from the trouble of relying only on vaccinations. May the Lord give us wisdom concerning how to lead the saints.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should not depend on arrangements. The elders must pray much and have more experiences of life. They also need to lead in life and cultivate a spiritual atmosphere in the meetings. If we would pray more, we would be strong in spirit and rich in the divine life; we would also want to serve. Our leading is organizational if it is merely based on the messages that we have heard and the methods that we have learned but lacks our experiences of life and our living in the spirit. If our leading is organizational, the saints will not receive the supply of life, and their spirit will not be strong. Furthermore, in such a situation the saints will only go as far as we drag them.</p>
<p>If we have the experiences of life, have a strong spirit, and supply life in the meetings to enliven the saints, they will spontaneously come to serve. There will be no need for many arrangements. Certain services of the church need arrangements in order to avoid chaos. However, if we can avoid arrangements, it is best to follow the leading of the Spirit and let everyone serve livingly in spirit without arrangements. We must be rich in our experience of life, have a strong spirit, and be living so that we will spontaneously be able to help others. When the church is brought into the realm of life, it will be easy for all the saints to serve.</p>
<p>In order for our spirit to be strong, we must pray much. It is impossible to be strong in spirit or to be rich in the divine life without praying. We must learn to pray, to contact the Lord and fellowship with Him. There is no need to be anxious concerning how to do things; the more we do, the more we will know. If we have never served, we will not know how to serve. We must pray in order for our spirit to be strong, just as children must eat in order to be physically strong and healthy. The elders must learn to pray; otherwise, they cannot serve properly.</p>
<p>We should not believe in our own ability or methods. Ability and methods may be successful in a social group, but they must not be used in the church. The church is an organism, not an organization. Hence, the leading ones must be in life. Organization, ability, and methods are of no use in the church; only life, which comes from prayer, is useful. We must learn to pray. The more we pray, the better.</p>
<p>When the responsible brothers meet together, they should spend at least three-quarters of their time praying together, and the remaining time can be spent discussing matters. Most of the time prayer is merely a formality, because most of the meeting is spent discussing matters. The elders should have thorough prayer when they gather together; they do not need to spend so much time to discuss or to study. They must exercise to pray, to be strong in spirit, to be living in spirit, and to learn the lesson of not depending on themselves. The more we depend on ourselves, the less we will pray. But the more we depend on the Lord, the more we will pray, and the more we pray, the more we will depend on the Lord. After we pass through prayer, we will let the Lord do what we formerly would have done ourselves.</p>
<p>We have many lessons to learn. Instead of doing things ourselves, we should let the Lord work. If the Lord does not do something, we should pray until He does something. Even if the Lord does only a little, it is a matter of life; however, there is no life in what we do. What the Lord does has life, but what we do does not have life. What the Lord does is in the organic realm of the Body, but what we do is only a social method. Therefore, every service must pass through prayer. Prayer cultivates our spirit to be living and strong and brings the proper atmosphere into the meetings. Those who pray much are strong in spirit and rich in life. Those who do not pray have a weak spirit and lack life. Only prayer can make us strong in spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE COMPLETING WORD OF GOD&mdash;<br />
CHRIST IN US</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:25-29</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL COMPLETING THE REVELATION OF GOD</h2>
<p>In Colossians 1:25 Paul says, &ldquo;I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.&rdquo; This means that although God spoke in the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, He did not finish speaking. The Lord spoke further in the Gospels, but He did not finish speaking; He did not say everything. Therefore, Paul became a minister to complete the word of God. This can be likened to making a garment; unless the collar is attached, the garment is not yet complete. The Old Testament can be likened to the main body of the garment, and the four Gospels can be likened to the sleeves. However, the garment is still missing a collar. Paul&rsquo;s ministry added a &ldquo;collar&rdquo; to the &ldquo;garment&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s speaking. The word of God, the revelation of God, is complete with the addition of Paul&rsquo;s ministry. Paul completed the word of God by completing the revelation of God.</p>
<p>A person who reads the Old Testament, the Gospels, and Acts but not the Epistles of Paul has not read the complete word of God; he is missing the central revelation. The central revelation is not in the Old Testament, the Gospels, or Acts but in Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles. We can say that the fourteen Epistles of Paul completed the revelation of God. God spoke much in the Old Testament, in the Gospels, and in Acts, but His word was not completed. Paul became a minister of the church and was entrusted with completing and finishing the word of God.</p>
<p>Concerning completing the word of God, Colossians 1:26-27 says, &ldquo;The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; The mystery is Christ; hence, the completing word is also Christ. Some may question why we say that the word of God was not completed in the Gospels, even though the four Gospels speak of Christ. The Gospels mainly show how the Lord was incarnated, lived on the earth, went to the cross, died to accomplish redemption, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the heavens. The Gospels do not elaborate on this incarnated Christ who died, resurrected, and ascended to the heavens to become the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit. Paul became a minister of the church in order to complete the word of God. This completing word, which was a hidden mystery, is &ldquo;Christ in you.&rdquo; Christ in us is the completion of the word of God and the completion of the revelation of God.</p>
<p>The completing word is not in the Old Testament or in the Gospels or in Acts; the completing word is in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. In the Gospels this completing word is briefly mentioned in John 14 and 15. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you&rdquo; (14:16-17), and &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you&rdquo; (15:4). John did not elaborate on this word. Christ&rsquo;s abiding in us, as well as His incarnation, death, resurrection, and becoming the life-giving Spirit in order to indwell us are particular to Paul&rsquo;s ministry. Paul elaborated on these points. This is Paul&rsquo;s ministry, the &ldquo;collar of the garment,&rdquo; the center of God&rsquo;s revelation. Without Paul&rsquo;s ministry the revelation of God is not complete.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s ministry completed the word of God. Even though God spoke in forty-four books&mdash;thirty-nine books in the Old Testament, four books of the Gospels, and the Acts&mdash;He had not finished speaking. Paul received a particular commission to complete the revelation of God. Hence, Paul&rsquo;s ministry was to complete the word of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE COMPLETED REVELATION IN THE BIBLE<br />
NOT BEING EASILY SEEN</h2>
<p>In our ministry of the word in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we are also burdened for the completion of the revelation of God. It is easy for Christians to see the teachings in the Old Testament, in the Gospels, and in Acts, but few Christians see the central revelation in Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles. This central revelation is not concerning husbands loving their wives or wives being subject to their husbands. It is not concerning worshipping God, fearing God, or even loving God. Worshipping God, fearing Him, loving Him, loving one&rsquo;s wife, being subject to one&rsquo;s husband, honoring one&rsquo;s parents, being perfect, being well-pleasing to God, and being redeemed and regenerated are revelations in the Bible. However, these revelations are not the completing revelation. The completing revelation is &ldquo;the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations&rdquo; (Col. 1:26). This mystery is &ldquo;Christ in you&rdquo; (v. 27). Thousands of Christians read the Bible, and they see many things but not the central revelation in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles.</p>
<p>Those in Christianity have heard many sermons concerning how to worship God, how to fear God, how to get saved, how to do good deeds, how to please God, how to preach the gospel, how to be filled by the Holy Spirit, how to have power from on high, how to testify for the Lord, how to love one&rsquo;s own wife, and how to be subject to one&rsquo;s own husband. However, in Christianity we did not hear a message concerning &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; We heard everything but the central revelation of God. To those in Christianity the Bible seems to consist only of thirty-nine books in the Old Testament and the four Gospels and the one book of Acts in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Some in Christianity may speak concerning Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Paul&rsquo;s other Epistles. However, when they speak concerning Romans, they speak only of man being sinful, the need of redemption, being justified by faith, presenting one&rsquo;s body as a living sacrifice to prove the well-pleasing will of God, being subject to authorities, and paying taxes where taxes are due. Much has been spoken concerning Romans. However, there is one point that has not been spoken, and this point is Romans 8:10: &ldquo;If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness.&rdquo; Hence, people generally neglect the completing word, the word that completes the revelation of God.</p>
<p>The same applies to us. We receive many teachings and much light from the messages that we hear and from reading the Life-study messages and the writings of Brother Nee. However, we lack the central light. The truths concerning baptism, bread-breaking, and head covering have been proclaimed for over forty years, but we do not see God&rsquo;s completing word. We read the Gospels but do not see the central revelation. We even read Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, which are full of the central revelation, but we do not see it.</p>
<p>Although we have been in many wedding ceremonies, we probably never heard a minister say, &ldquo;So-and-so, you are in Christ, and Christ abides in you. You cannot be a good husband in yourself. Christ wants to be the good husband in you.&rdquo; At every wedding ceremony the minister reads Ephesians 5 and then exhorts the couple, saying, &ldquo;Groom So-and-so, are you willing to love your wife from this day on? Bride So-and-so, are you willing to be subject to your husband from this day on?&rdquo; In the prayer books for the ministers there is even a special section on how to conduct weddings. It is true that loving one&rsquo;s wife and being subject to one&rsquo;s husband are in the Bible, but these are not the completing word.</p>
<p>The completing word is the mystery that has been hidden from the ages and from the generations. This mystery is &ldquo;Christ in you.&rdquo; Paul in his Epistles elaborates on this mystery. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we too are elaborating on this word. Our ministry of the word is a ministry that completes the divine revelation.</p>
<p>Christians are ignorant concerning God&rsquo;s completing word, and even many elders and co-workers among us do not see the completing word. It is possible to talk about coordination, about the younger ones being subject to the older ones, and about many other things, yet we may not have a basic understanding of the completion of God&rsquo;s word. Coordination is not the completion of God&rsquo;s word nor is the breaking of bread or head covering. The completion of God&rsquo;s word is &ldquo;Christ in you.&rdquo; However, people do not see this word when they read the Bible, because it is a mystery. Even though this mystery is emphasized in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, people read it but do not see it.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS AND CO-WORKERS NEEDING TO SEE<br />
THE VISION OF CHRIST BEING IN US</h2>
<p>The elders and co-workers must have experiences of life, live in the spirit, and be able to supply life to others. Hence, the elders and the co-workers need a basic understanding of Christ being the life-giving Spirit in the believers. Second Corinthians 3:6 says, &ldquo;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life,&rdquo; and verse 17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Christians love the Gospel of John, but they neglect what the Lord Jesus said in chapter 14: &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter...even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you...In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (vv. 16-17, 20). Christ in us is the mystery that has been hidden from the ages and from the generations. The Lord Jesus briefly mentioned this mystery in John 14. When Paul came, he elaborated on this word in his fourteen Epistles and thus completed the divine revelation. Without Paul&rsquo;s Epistles the divine revelation would not be complete, nor would it have a center or a focus. The Epistles of Paul completed the divine revelation.</p>
<p>The elders and co-workers must see this vision. We often say that we have seen the vision of Christ and the church. This statement is too general. We must see that the completing word of the divine revelation is Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit to indwell us and to be our life so that we may have experiences of life. This is our vision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCING, ADMONISHING, AND TEACHING</h2>
<p>Speaking concerning Christ, Paul says, &ldquo;Whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom&rdquo; (Col. 1:28). In Greek <em>announce</em> has the meaning of &ldquo;declare.&rdquo; We first declare Christ, report Him; then we admonish and teach every man. First we declare, proclaim, and report to the whole universe, and then based on our report we admonish and teach every man. To admonish is to warn people that if their living, activity, or work is not Christ, it will be consumed by fire. In other words, it is to warn people not to walk apart from Christ. If we are not abiding in Christ, our walk will be consumed by fire (cf. 1 Cor. 3:13-15). Therefore, we must teach every man after admonishing him.</p>
<p>We should not think that Christ&rsquo;s being in us does not need to be taught. If we know this vision, we will teach the sisters according to this vision. We might say, &ldquo;Do not reason with your husband. Do you know that Christ in you is your life? When you reason with your husband, is it you reasoning, or is it Christ?&rdquo; Many sisters need such teaching. It is not sufficient to hear messages in the meetings; there must also be teaching. Only when the elders have been taught can they teach the middle-aged saints and also the teenage saints. The elders might say, &ldquo;Brothers, do not quarrel. This is not Christ. We need to live out Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The purpose of admonishing and teaching is to present every man full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28), that is, to bring every saint unto maturity in Christ and then to present the mature saints to God. For example, graduation ceremonies are held to present the students who have completed their studies to their parents. In order for their children to be educated, parents send them to school for several years. The school educates and matures the children to become useful persons. Then the principal and teachers present the educated children as gifts to their parents. Paul says that Christ is the hope of glory in the saints. We must announce Christ and then admonish every saint and teach every saint in all wisdom so that every saint may mature in Christ. Then we can present every matured saint to God the Father. This is what the elders should do.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CHRIST AND THE SELF</h2>
<p><em>Question: How do we distinguish between what is of Christ and what is of the self?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is no need to continually ask whether something is of the self or of Christ. Such questions cause more confusion. We always alternate which leg we extend when we walk. Paying attention to which leg is extended first will make it difficult for us to walk. I am over seventy years old, but I still do not know whether I first extend my right leg or my left leg when I walk. As soon as we stop when we realize that something is not Christ, it is sufficient. If we do not know whether something is Christ, we should continue. As long as we are able to stop once we realize something is not Christ, then it is very good. It is difficult to determine whether something is Christ, but it is easy to determine whether something is not Christ. For example, suppose we want to dispute with the brothers. We know that to dispute is not Christ; hence, we should stop immediately. Sometimes being polite to people is not Christ. It is easier to determine what is not Christ than it is to determine what is Christ.</p>
<p>Here is another example. We are not aware of our stomach when we are healthy, but when our stomach is upset, we are aware of it. If we are not aware of our stomach, it is not sick; hence, we should pay no attention to our stomach and eat as usual. But if our stomach is upset, we need to pay attention to our diet. Similarly, whenever we act by the self to dispute or argue with others, we will have a sense, but when we walk by Christ, we will not have much sense.</p>
<p>Our problem is that often we know we are walking by the self, but we do not stop. This offends the Lord. The unique sin of an unbeliever is not believing in Christ, but the unique sin of a believer is not living Christ. We know that not living Christ is a sin, but we do not condemn it. There are twenty-four hours in a day, and eight hours are for us to sleep. Of the remaining sixteen hours we live by the self more than ninety percent of the time. We cannot deny this. When we live by the self instead of living Christ, we stiffen our neck and continue living by the self. The Lord is merciful; hence, He draws us and we pray. When we pray, we enter the spirit and stop living by the self but instead live Christ. We need to be saved from such a miserable condition of going in and out of our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p><em>Question: Even though the Bible uses different words to describe the work of the Holy Spirit, there are different schools of thought in Christianity concerning the work of the Spirit. What should our attitude be toward this?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Christians have always disputed concerning the work of the Holy Spirit. Some Christians speak of the power of the Holy Spirit, others speak of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and still others speak of the infilling of the Holy Spirit. However, the Bible speaks only of an all-inclusive Spirit. We must be careful not to get entangled by doctrine. We have been in doctrines for many years, and I have even written books on these matters. But today I would only say that the Holy Spirit is not just power; He is the all-inclusive Spirit. He is life, He is light, and He is all in all. The question is whether we apply Him and enjoy Him.</p>
<p>Concerning the Spirit, Christians often go to either of two extremes. The so-called fundamentalists are on one extreme; they do not pay much attention to the Holy Spirit. The so-called Pentecostals are on the other extreme; they pay attention to the Holy Spirit, but they are excessive in their practice. The proper way for us to experience the all-inclusive Spirit is to fellowship with Him, to be enlightened by Him, and to live in Him. If He leads us to do something, we should do it, but if He does not lead us to do something, we should not do it. He is our everything. When we need power to preach the gospel, He is our power, and when we need faith to pray, He is our faith.</p>
<p>We must be saved from fundamentalism, Pentecostalism, and terminology. Concerning the work of the Holy Spirit, the Bible speaks of the outpouring of the Spirit, the inward filling and the outward filling of the Spirit, the Spirit as power, and the indwelling of the Spirit. However, this Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit. It is sufficient for us to pray, exercise faith, and follow Him when He leads us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT<br />
TO LIVE OUT CHRIST</h2>
<p><em>Question: Should the brothers exhort and correct one another?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is only one answer to this question. We should do what the Spirit leads us to do. If the Spirit does not lead us to correct others, we should not correct them; otherwise, we are meddling in their affairs. The young people are always interested in others&rsquo; affairs. However, those who are more experienced feel that they cannot manage even their own affairs, let alone others&rsquo; affairs. An experienced person would pray and follow the leading of the Spirit to supply others with life when he is concerned for them. Some might say that we should correct others and point out their mistakes, because the Bible tells us to exhort one another. However, before correcting others, we should first check whether we are right with God; otherwise, we are the ones who need correction.</p>
<p>The only question is whether we walk according to the spirit. As long as we walk according to the spirit, every problem will be resolved. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost is in Acts, yet Paul did not mention it when he completed the revelation of God. Even though in 1 Corinthians Paul mentions speaking in tongues, he does not encourage people to speak in tongues; instead, he exercises wisdom and love to correct those who abuse speaking in tongues. Hardly anyone in the Pentecostal movement does not abuse speaking in tongues. Therefore, Paul says, &ldquo;In the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue&rdquo; (14:19). Unless a person is biased, he probably would stop speaking in tongues after reading 1 Corinthians.</p>
<p>According to Paul, prophesying builds up the church (v. 4), but speaking in tongues does not. To prophesy is to minister the word, that is, to speak clear words with light, life, and the riches of Christ. The word <em>prophesy</em> is rendered as &ldquo;preach as a prophet&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version. However, <em>prophesy</em> does not emphasize foretelling. To prophesy is to be an oracle of God in order to speak for God. This is the ministry of the word. What helps the church is not speaking in tongues but prophesying, speaking forth God.</p>
<p>We are not saying that preaching the gospel does not need power. The power of the gospel is not the power spoken of by the Pentecostal movement. In Chefoo, Shantung, there was a Pentecostal assembly hall next to our meeting hall. Those who met in the Pentecostal assembly hall knew and spoke of nothing but Pentecostalism, which to them was speaking in tongues and healing. One of their responsible brothers came to fellowship with me one day. I did not debate with him over doctrines but spoke the fact. I said, &ldquo;Brother, for years we have not talked about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, power, or speaking in tongues, yet we baptized a hundred and twenty this month and will baptize more next month. There are no empty seats in our meetings, and our hall is not large enough for us. You always speak of power and speaking in tongues, but there are still less than a hundred meeting with you. Where is this power?&rdquo; He was speechless.</p>
<p>In 1965 I returned to Taiwan from the United States. At that time the Pentecostal movement was on the rise, and people were saying that there would be a great revival worldwide in 1966 and that this revival would begin from Taiwan. More than a decade has passed, but there has been no great revival in Taiwan, and those in the Pentecostal movement are scattered.</p>
<p>A group of people took Pentecostalism to Sitiawan, Malaysia, in 1963. They occupied the meeting hall of the church and put up their own sign outside the meeting hall. Only a few elderly brothers and sisters and some children were left in the church. Those in the Pentecostal movement thought that the church was finished, but those ones later became divided. The few elderly brothers and sisters and the children who were left in the local church built a new meeting hall, and there are now over a hundred people meeting. This is the power of God.</p>
<p>I would like to ask those in the Pentecostal movement where their power is and whether their speaking in tongues is real, because it should have been powerful and yielded results. A tree is known by its fruit. Many gospel giants did not speak in tongues, but they were full of power. Power is not a matter of terminology; power is the all-inclusive Spirit. If we draw from this Spirit and exercise faith, pray, fellowship with the Lord, and walk by the spirit, we will have power.</p>
<p>If someone asks about Pentecostalism, we can use the facts from history to prove to him that the Pentecostal movements are not long-lived and that Pentecostalism is a source of divisions among Christians. The Spirit is oneness, not division. However, those in Pentecostalism regard division as normal; they do not consider division to be a serious matter.</p>
<p>Our God is triune. He has passed through incarnation, human living, and death on the cross, and He has entered into resurrection and ascended to the heavens. He has done everything and is now ultimately manifested as the all-inclusive Spirit. He dwells in us and wants us to be clothed with Him. Paul says, &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 3:27). Those who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. Christ is power. The Spirit who descended at Pentecost was Christ; the Spirit we have received is not separate from Christ. Christ is the Spirit; He is life, power, light, authority, and exaltation; He is everything. We must be joined to the Spirit as one spirit in order to fellowship with Him and walk in Him. Whenever we have a need, we must apply Him by faith.</p>
<p>We cannot use only one book in the Bible to determine any truth; we must use the whole Bible. In Acts there is the record of speaking in tongues at Pentecost (2:4, 6, 8, 11), but not much is said concerning speaking in tongues in the Epistles. Paul mentions speaking in tongues in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, but he does so to restrict and correct, not to encourage. Afterward, in Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians, in the heart of the Epistles, Paul does not mention speaking in tongues. At the end of the Bible, in Revelation, only the seven Spirits are mentioned; nothing is said concerning speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>In summary, the light that we have received reveals the Triune God becoming the life-giving Spirit in order to be one spirit with us. Everything depends on our fellowshipping with Him and applying Him. The Bible says many things, but it can all be summarized in one sentence: &ldquo;Walk...according to the spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 8:4). Honoring one&rsquo;s parents, obeying one&rsquo;s husband, loving one&rsquo;s wife, and being humble should be according to the spirit. If we are not according to the spirit, our pride should be condemned, and our humility should be condemned; our hatred should be condemned, and our love should be condemned. Our love must be according to the spirit; it should come from the spirit. This is what God wants. The Spirit is Christ; hence, to be according to the spirit is to live out Christ. Only Christ is acceptable to God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">SETTING ASIDE RITUALS TO SERVE IN SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THEOLOGICAL DISPUTES<br />
CONCERNING THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>There are two extreme and erroneous schools of teaching concerning the truth that God is triune, that is, three yet one. Tritheism stresses the matter of three, teaching that there are three separate Gods: the Father is one God, the Son is one God, and the Spirit is another God. Modalism stresses the matter of one, teaching that God ceased to be the Father when the Son was manifested and that God ceased to be the Son when the Son ascended and became the Spirit. Since the second century there have been many disputes concerning the Triune God. All the truths in the Bible have two aspects. The truth concerning God has the aspect of God being three and of His being one. The word <em>triune</em> comes from Latin and is composed of the words <em>three</em> and <em>one.</em></p>
<p>The Bible reveals that there is only one God. In the Old Testament the book of Isaiah says, &ldquo;I am Jehovah and there is no one else; / Besides Me there is no God&rdquo; (45:5). Psalm 86:10 says, &ldquo;You alone are God.&rdquo; The New Testament also says that God is one&mdash;there is one God (Mark 12:32; 1 Cor. 8:4, 6; 1 Tim. 2:5; James 2:19). However, the Bible also says that this God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Hence, in Christianity there is the term <em>Trinity,</em> which is used to express the truth that God is one in three persons. But this term can easily be understood as being tritheistic.</p>
<p>A co-worker, who was influenced by this term, came to Los Angeles in 1965 to argue with me. I asked, &ldquo;Brother, how many Gods would you say there are?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Three Gods.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Brother, never say such a thing; this is a great heresy.&rdquo; But he argued, &ldquo;Psalm 82 mentions <em>gods,</em>&rdquo; and I explained, &ldquo;The word <em>gods</em> in verse 1 refers to angels. There are many angels, but both the Old Testament and the New Testament say clearly that we have only one God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because Brother Nee realized that the term <em>Trinity</em> could be easily misunderstood, he preferred the term <em>triune.</em> The church fathers created the term <em>Trinity</em> because they did not understand the truth concerning the Triune God. In Chinese <em>Trinity</em> is rendered &ldquo;three persons in one entity.&rdquo; Our God is one, but He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The error of modalism is that it does not confess the eternal coexistence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Modalists accept the truth in the Bible concerning there being only one God, but they take this truth to the extreme and say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit exist in three consecutive modes and do not coexist eternally. Because of this great error, modalists are heretical.</p>
<p>Some in the United States oppose us and say that we are modalistic. We told them that although we say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one, we also confess the eternal coexistence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; The phrase <em>the Word was God</em> indicates that the Word and God are one, and the phrase <em>the Word was with God</em> indicates that the Word and God are distinct. The word <em>with</em> proves that the Son did not come into existence after the Father. If the Son had come into existence after the Father, They could not have been with each other. In order for one to be with the other, They must exist at the same time. In John 17:5 the Lord Jesus prayed, &ldquo;Glorify Me along with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.&rdquo; This proves that the Father did not exist first and then become the Son, who then later became the Spirit.</p>
<p>Tritheists teach that the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit. They do not confess that the Lord is the Spirit. Therefore, they interpret <em>the Lord</em> in 2 Corinthians 3:17 as &ldquo;God.&rdquo; They say that <em>the Lord is the Spirit</em> means the same as <em>God is Spirit</em> in John 4:24. This is their interpretation. However, if we read the context of 2 Corinthians 3:17, we will understand that they have misinterpreted this verse. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Their thoughts were hardened; for until the present day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant, it not being unveiled to them that the veil is being done away with in Christ.&rdquo; This verse says that the veil is being done away with in Christ. Verses 15 and 16 say, &ldquo;A veil lies on their heart; but whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&rdquo; Verse 16 says that whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. This is strong proof that these verses are speaking of the same thing. Christ in verse 14 is the Lord in verse 16. The Lord is Christ. In verse 14 the Bible says, &ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; and in verse 16 the Bible says, &ldquo;The Lord.&rdquo; Then verse 17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Therefore, according to the context, the Lord refers to Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; According to the context, this portion of the Scriptures is concerning our being transformed into the image of God&rsquo;s Son. Romans 8:29 also speaks of our being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son. What 2 Corinthians calls the Lord&rsquo;s image is called the image of God&rsquo;s Son in Romans. This proves that the Lord in 2 Corinthians 3 is the Lord Jesus. Moreover, in 2 Corinthians 4:5 Paul says, &ldquo;We do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence, according to the context of 2 Corinthians 3 and 4, the Lord is Christ. In order to conform to their theory, tritheists misinterpret <em>the Lord</em> in 2 Corinthians 3 as &ldquo;God.&rdquo; However, if we agree that <em>the Lord</em> here refers to <em>God,</em> we must say that since the Lord Jesus is God, and God is the Spirit, then the Lord Jesus must be the Spirit.</p>
<p>We have inherited the orthodox truth that has been passed down through the generations. This light is becoming brighter and clearer to us. Therefore, we can boldly declare, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Spirit is the Triune God having passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension to the heavens, and descension to the earth; hence, the Spirit possesses both divinity and humanity. On this point we were greatly helped by Brother Andrew Murray&rsquo;s book <em>The Spirit of Christ.</em> Andrew Murray was probably the first to see that humanity is in the Spirit. We were also blessed by the Lord to see the type of the holy anointing oil in the Old Testament. The holy anointing oil in Exodus 30 is composed of pure olive oil compounded with four spices (vv. 23-25). The Brethren taught that the holy anointing oil typifies the Holy Spirit. We acknowledge that this is correct. However, the Brethren did not see that the holy anointing oil contains the elements of divinity and humanity as well as the elements of Christ&rsquo;s death and His resurrection.</p>
<p>The Spirit is the compound Spirit. He is typified not only by olive oil but by olive oil compounded, mingled, with four elements. Today the Spirit is not just oil; He is an ointment, possessing the elements of divinity, humanity, crucifixion, and resurrection. This is the Spirit. Our life is in this Spirit, and our living should also be in this Spirit. Furthermore, our service and work should be in this Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">DROPPING RITUALS AND<br />
LEARNING TO USE OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Regrettably, the work, service, and worship in Christianity are ritualistic, of the letter, and not in the Spirit, and sometimes our service and meetings have departed from the Spirit to become rituals. Romans 7:6 says, &ldquo;We serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.&rdquo; However, in some places the service has become an ordinance with rigid rituals of the letter.</p>
<p>Please allow me to ask, &ldquo;In elders&rsquo; meetings do the elders fellowship and pray in spirit, or are the meetings according to customs?&rdquo; When the elders come together, do they always begin the meeting with prayer? Is this prayer a routine for beginning the meeting, or are the elders truly burdened in spirit to pray with one another? If the elders are not burdened, the prayers are rituals. In some churches the elders pray for ten or more minutes when they gather together, but the content of their fellowship is unrelated to their prayers. This indicates that the prayers are ritualistic. The elders should come together with one heart, in one spirit, and with one burden. They should also have thorough prayer together for a matter or several matters before fellowshipping in spirit. If they are still not clear concerning a matter, they should have further prayer and fellowship. Such prayers are spiritual, not ritualistic. If the prayers in the elders&rsquo; meetings are ritualistic opening prayers, praying has become an ordinance.</p>
<p>We have given many messages on the spirit and on life, but in our living, meetings, and service we lack the spirit. As a result, for more than a decade we have wanted to tear down the rituals in our meetings. Ten years ago if a meeting began at 7:30 in the evening, the saints who arrived at 7:25 would sit down and wait for the elders to arrive in order for the meeting to begin. After four minutes the elders would arrive and also sit down. The elders would look to one another to know who would begin the meeting. Eventually, one elder would call a hymn, and the meeting would begin. Such a meeting lacked the spirit. This was our pitiful condition.</p>
<p>In 1961 we wanted to get through in the matter of being in spirit, but we could not get through. At the end of that year the Lord took me to the United States. In 1962 I began working in the United States, and I emphasized the spirit from the beginning of my ministry. Therefore, the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States began in the spirit. Our meetings had no procedures. Whoever was the first to arrive for a meeting would sing or pray. This is how the Lord&rsquo;s recovery began in the United States. In many places in the United States there is no singing or speaking in the prayer meeting, nor do the brothers announce the prayer items. Suppose the prayer meeting begins at seven thirty. Those who arrive early begin praying. As other saints arrive, they join in and pray. The saints pray until nine thirty. There is no singing, nor is there the ministry of the word; there is only prayer. This is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to deliver the churches in the United States from the deadness of rituals.</p>
<p>It is easy for us to fall into the rituals of Christianity. In some local churches the service is organizational. How to be an elder, how to listen to the elders, who is a co-worker, and how the co-workers and elders handle affairs have all become rituals. No one knows how to meet or serve without the rituals, and no one knows how to function without the rules. The only ones who speak are those assigned to speak. This is a ritual. May the Lord have mercy on us and deliver us from rituals so that we would learn to live in our spirit. We must exercise our spirit in the meetings and in our daily living. We must also follow the spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord is my witness that while speaking with my wife, I must sometimes swallow a word that is on the tip of my tongue, because the Spirit forbids me from saying the word. There is a voice within me that says, &ldquo;Do not say it!&rdquo; This is a negative experience of following the Spirit. Sometimes the Spirit wants to move, and I move according to the Spirit, or the Spirit wants me to speak, and I speak according to the Spirit. This is a positive experience of following the Spirit. If we exercise our spirit regularly, it will be easy for us to be in spirit and to walk by the Spirit in the meetings. The genuine exercise of setting our mind on the spirit is in our daily living. In our daily living we should let the Spirit control our mind, emotion, and will and also let our whole being be controlled, restricted, and led by our spirit. Then we will be according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>When we are thus subdued by the Spirit and led by the Spirit, the Spirit will do a killing work in us. He will kill our flesh, our self, our temper, and our lusts, and the power of resurrection will also operate in us. Then our spirit will be released with authority and light when we speak, and our spirit will be released with the supply of life and the anointing when we pray. Because our spirit is released when we speak and pray, people will receive the supply of life and be watered. This should be our condition. Everyone who comes to our home and fellowships with us should touch the release of our spirit. If we would exercise our spirit in our daily living, our spirit will be released in our singing and our speaking whenever we gather together. Then our meetings will be filled with praise and thanksgiving, and they will not be disorderly.</p>
<p>It is easy to accept methods, but it is not easy to know or exercise our spirit. We must learn to exercise our spirit and not focus on methods. Although methods are helpful, it is more important for us to learn to use our spirit. For example, in the prayer meeting there is no need to ask who should pray or what to pray about; instead, we should endeavor to use our spirit to pray. Likewise, what we should say in a meeting is secondary; the primary matter is to exercise our spirit and speak according to our spirit.</p>
<p>Some people are naturally well behaved, but they cannot be moved by the Spirit; they are like walls of bronze and iron. Such persons need to be broken in order for their spirit to be released. Some have been practicing being broken, but their spirit is not released. These saints do not practice the release of the spirit; they practice the breaking of the outer man. As a result, their spirit is not released even though they may be broken. The messages that Brother Nee gave in <em>The Breaking of the Outer Man and the Release of the Spirit</em> are focused on the release of the spirit, not on the breaking of the outer man.</p>
<p>I hope that the focus of the elders&rsquo; meetings in the different localities would not be fellowshipping about different things but that the elders would learn to be open to one another in their meetings. We should not fear being open; we should only care for the release of our spirit through prayer. This is how everyone should pray. Do not ask how long we should pray. We should pray as the Spirit leads, even if we have to pray until the end of the world. When something is brought up, there is no need to ask how it would be done, when it would be done, or who would do it. Nor should we take any word of guidance as an ordinance. &ldquo;The letter kills&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:6). We must learn not to care for ordinances but rather to care only for our spirit. The co-workers who serve in a locality should not ask people to do things; instead, they should fellowship with the saints and supply them with life.</p>
<p>Our spirit is living, and our Lord is the Spirit. Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom&rdquo; (v. 17). If we are not free, it is because we do not have the Spirit. The condition of the churches does not depend on whether our methods change but on whether we are in spirit. We need to have thorough fellowship and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading in spirit rather than conform to old ordinances. This is how the apostles worked for the Lord. The Lord had a different leading for Peter, Paul, and John; they did not conform to old ordinances. Even though they were different, they were the testimony of Jesus Christ because they lived in their spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING POOR IN SPIRIT AND PURE IN HEART</h2>
<p><em>Question: Many saints were in a good condition when they served, but their condition deteriorated when they went astray. Since there is no guarantee that I will not go astray in the future, is it not dangerous to serve?</em></p>
<p>Answer: None of us is free from making mistakes. The only person in the Bible who never erred was the Lord Jesus. Even the apostle Paul made mistakes. Every human being makes mistakes. Some, however, make mistakes but do not depart from the right way, yet others depart from the right way as soon as they make a mistake. When the Lord Jesus spoke concerning the constitution of the kingdom in Matthew 5, He gave two basic conditions: one is to be poor in spirit, and the other is to be pure in heart (vv. 3, 8). If, instead of being poor in spirit or pure in heart, we have pursuits other than God, it will be easy for us to depart from the right way when we make a mistake. However, if we are poor in spirit and pure in heart, we will not depart from the right way, even though we may make many mistakes.</p>
<p>If we examine those who have gone astray, we will see that the problem was not a matter of right or wrong but of whether one was poor in spirit and pure in heart. A person who is not poor in spirit is self-satisfied and unable to receive help from others. A person who is not pure in heart has something other than God as his goal. The Lord said, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God&rdquo; (v. 8). God should be our unique goal. As soon as our goal deviates from God, our heart is no longer pure. It is easy for those who are not pure in heart and have pursuits other than God to stray from the right way when they make a mistake. Several churches in the Far East have passed through turmoils. Before going astray and leaving, some were quite vocal in their support of the church, but after they left, they stopped speaking concerning the church. This proves that something other than God was their goal and that they were not pure in heart. Therefore, being kept on the right way in spite of our mistakes depends on whether we are poor in spirit and pure in heart.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS&rsquo; TERM OF OFFICE</h2>
<p><em>Question: In the Bible the elders&rsquo; term of office seems to be for life. But in practice should the elders follow the practice of the Old Testament priests and retire at the age of fifty?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The term of the Old Testament priests ended when they reached the age of fifty (Num. 4:3; 8:24-25) because one&rsquo;s physical strength begins to decline at the age of fifty. According to this principle, if the elders are declining spiritually or physically, they should withdraw and let others serve as elders. At the age of fifty Old Testament priests withdrew from the service because their strength began to decline. The New Testament does not give an age limit for the service of the elders, but we should withdraw and let others serve as elders if our physical strength begins to decline. If we begin to decline and cannot keep up, we should let others serve.</p>
<p>If our condition is proper, every elder should be clear whether his being an elder benefits the church. He should know whether it would benefit the church for him to stay or for him to withdraw. He should make such a decision in the best interest of the church. The principle of withdrawal from the eldership should be fresh and a matter of life. Every elder should consider the current condition of his local church to know whether it would be beneficial to the church for him to remain or to withdraw. We should not consider matters for ourselves but should consider the gain and loss to the church. If the church gains from our staying, we should stay, but if the church suffers loss from our staying, we should not stay. This is a healthy condition.</p>
<p>There is no rule concerning whether we should withdraw from the eldership. Our withdrawal depends on the Spirit and on the gain or loss that the church would incur. If we are poor in spirit, pure in heart, and do not covet anything, we will accept how the Lord leads when He leads. However, if we covet something, are self-satisfied, and are not poor in spirit or pure in heart, we will make things difficult.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">COORDINATING IN LOVE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:31; 13:1-8, 13; 14:1; 8:1</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider love. Love is an important item that we are familiar with but neglect.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWLEDGE AND GIFTS NOT BEING LIFE</h2>
<p>First Corinthians deals with the problems of speaking in tongues, knowledge, and gifts. In chapter 1 Paul told the believers in Corinth, &ldquo;In everything you were enriched in Him, in all utterance and all knowledge...so that you do not lack in any gift&rdquo; (vv. 5, 7). The Corinthian believers had problems because they were rich in knowledge and gifts and lacked nothing. They were rich in knowledge and were well-gifted, but they were disorderly. The New Testament reveals that the church in Corinth was a very disorderly church; no local church was as disorderly as the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>The church in Corinth was not only disorderly; it was also sinful and was not even clear concerning idols. It is remarkable that they were rich in knowledge and had many gifts and yet were disorderly, sinful, and involved with idols. This shows that knowledge is not life, and gifts are not life. At the end of chapter 1 the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption&rdquo; (v. 30). God made Christ wisdom to us as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. God did not make Christ our knowledge, eloquence, or gift.</p>
<p>Some may not appreciate this word, because spiritual knowledge, eloquence, and gifts are highly regarded among Christians. A person who can speak clearly, logically, and engagingly with clever words, quoting verses and telling stories with parables, is considered to be a first-rate preacher. Famous preachers do not stammer, are eloquent, and have a resounding voice. As long as a person can stand up in a crowd and give a flowing and articulate speech with a voice that is resounding and melodious, he will be popular. He does not need to know how to give many messages, for if he can give thirty to fifty messages, he will be able to conduct revival meetings and will be welcomed everywhere.</p>
<p>Famous preachers, however, damage the church because they form their own sects. When a preacher becomes famous and popular, he will form a sect. This happens in the West and also in the East. The older saints who became Christians at a young age have watched Christianity for over half a century. During this time there was not one famous Chinese preacher who did not form his own sect, and no two famous preachers have been able to cooperate with each other. Even though such preachers made lofty statements, claiming to be one in Christ, to believe in the same Lord, to have the same faith, and to be the Lord&rsquo;s servants, they could not work together but rather were jealous of one another.</p>
<p>We must see that eloquence, knowledge, and gifts are damaging. Paul did not use words such as <em>vipers</em> or <em>fierce beasts</em> to describe the believers in Corinth; rather, he was cautious in his words to them. He told the Corinthians that although they had all eloquence and all knowledge and did not lack in any gift, he would show them a most excellent way. No way is more excellent than love (12:31&mdash;13:3).</p>
<p>The Corinthians wanted eloquence, knowledge, and gifts, but they were not spiritual. Paul called them fleshy (3:1). Likewise, many people today care about the outward manifestation of gifts but not the indwelling Spirit. Furthermore, some of the so-called tongues spoken by the Pentecostal Christians are not genuine tongues. What came out of the mouth of Balaam&rsquo;s donkey was an authentic and genuine tongue (Num. 22:28-30). But even if people speak in genuine tongues, Paul considered such ones as sounding brass and clanging cymbals, being without life (1 Cor. 13:1).</p>
<p>Some are eloquent but are sounding brass and clanging cymbals; others stammer but are outlets of life. Which kind of believer do we prefer? Many would prefer sounding brass and clanging cymbals instead of stammerers, but Paul said that the lifeless gifts, the sounding brass and clanging cymbals, caused problems in the church. The Corinthians treasured the gifts; they felt that Paul was good, that Apollos was good, and that Cephas was good. Paul, Apollos, and Cephas suited three kinds of human taste. Hence, some in Corinth said that they were of Paul, others said that they were of Apollos, and still others said that they were of Cephas (1:12). Thus, the church in Corinth had strife, factions, and sects.</p>
<p>The believers in Corinth did not lack in any gift (v. 7), but instead of being spiritual, they had strong natural tastes. Factions arise when there is a preference for and an appreciation of different tastes. For example, spicier foods match the Szechuan taste, and blander foods match the Beijing taste. In serving the church, our spiritual taste should be as indistinct as possible. We should not have a sense of &ldquo;spice&rdquo; or &ldquo;blandness,&rdquo; nor should we be attracted by an &ldquo;aroma&rdquo;; we should have regard only for eating until we are satisfied. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace we should not be picky about the &ldquo;taste&rdquo; of the meetings; we should simply eat. When the saints rise up to testify or release the word, we should not have any preferences. We simply receive Christ and the supply of life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE REALITY OF CHRIST,<br />
AND LOVE BEING THE EXPRESSION OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;Love never falls away. But whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless&rdquo; (13:8). Only love is eternal, lasts forever, because love is out of life. Hence, Paul says, &ldquo;If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. And if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I dole out all my possessions to feed others, and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love, I profit nothing&rdquo; (vv. 1-3). In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we must love one another. The love in 1 Corinthians 13 is life; the expression of life is love.</p>
<p>In Ephesians there are two phrases that are two sides of one thing. These two phrases are <em>in love</em> (1:4; 3:17; 4:2, 15, 16; 5:2) and <em>in spirit</em> (2:22; 3:5; 5:18; 6:18). What is within is the spirit, and what is expressed is love. There is also another phrase&mdash;<em>in Christ</em> (1:3, 10, 12; 4:32). If we are not in spirit, we cannot be in Christ or in love. The Spirit is the reality of Christ, and love is the expression of the Spirit. These are our touchstones. Our being in the Spirit depends on our being in love. If we are in love, we are of the Lord and in the Spirit, and our love will be pure. Such love is the expression of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. If we are in love, we are in the Spirit, not in knowledge or gifts. In the sphere of love, life is rich and flourishing.</p>
<p>Paul says, &ldquo;Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up&rdquo; (1 Cor. 8:1). Much knowledge puffs people up. Only love can build people up and edify people. Love can build up the church and build us into the church. Without love, we are sounding brass and clanging cymbals; that is, we are lifeless, and we are useless to the church. The less love we have, the more we damage the church. It is not the card players or the moviegoers who damage the building but those who are without love, even though they can preach according to knowledge and gifts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACCEPTING GOD&rsquo;S ARRANGEMENT AND<br />
LEARNING TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER</h2>
<p>Several co-workers and I have been seeking the Lord and fellowshipping concerning the responsible brothers in a certain locality. We feel that five middle-aged brothers and two elderly brothers should be &ldquo;bound&rdquo; together so that they bear responsibility together. These seven brothers have not coordinated together in the past, but now that they are bearing responsibility together, they must be &ldquo;bound&rdquo; together to the extent that they love one another. These brothers should say, &ldquo;Lord, give us love. We need to love one another. We may be wrong, but You are never wrong. You have placed us here and bound us together. We thank and praise You that we were born into Your family and have seen the vision. We will never escape.&rdquo; These brothers should be &ldquo;disarmed&rdquo; and love one another. Whether or not they are willing, as soon as they are bound together, love will abound.</p>
<p>I appreciate the traditional Chinese marriages. After living in America for many years, I feel that modern marriages have many problems. There is too much choice and freedom in modern marriages. The young men and women do not listen to their parents. Hence, two people can take an interest in each other if they have the same taste or temperament. According to statistics, the percentage of divorces and separations in such free, modern marriages is quite high. The reason such marriages fail is that there is too much freedom and self-choice. The old-fashioned Chinese marriages bound two people together whether they loved each other or not. This might seem harsh, but the percentage of couples who remained together is high.</p>
<p>When I was young, the phrase <em>a match made in heaven</em> was posted in my hometown every time someone got married. Such marriages were arranged by the parents but were called a match made in heaven. Because the young man and the young woman recognized that their marriage was the will of heaven, they accepted the marriage. They did not need other people or pastors to ask whether they loved each other; both parties believed that since the marriage was the will of heaven, it would be blessed by heaven. There was no choice in such old-fashioned Chinese marriages; there was only complete resignation to the will of heaven. As a result, the matches were free of problems. If left to choice, a young man or woman might choose a good counterpart but see a better one after several months or an even better one several years later. How can a person decide? Who has the assurance that his insight will give him the best choice? A young woman might choose someone with a dignified appearance, only to suffer later because he has a crooked heart. If the door of choice is closed at the beginning, everything will be the &ldquo;will of heaven,&rdquo; and the result will be heaven-made matches that are happy and free of problems. Brother Nee once said that the young people should open their eyes wide and make thorough observations before getting engaged, but they should close their eyes and be blind as well as deaf after they are engaged and married. I would further say that it is better for the young people to be blind and deaf even while they are looking for a spouse.</p>
<p>The young people are in the age of science and may not believe my word. They may think that I am too old-fashioned and completely out of touch with the current of the age. However, I have fifty years of experience and have observed much in northern China, southern China, Taiwan, and the United States. Those with strong opinions in choosing a spouse do not necessarily have a good outcome. During the last twenty years in the United States I have seen at least five hundred couples get married. Those who were choosy usually had a bad outcome, but for those who were simple, things usually turned out well. By simple I mean that these ones did not choose on their own but gave the matter to God. They often said, &ldquo;Lord, I was made by You. My future is in Your hands. You know who would be a good and suitable spouse for me. I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have likened the change of responsible brothers in a locality to marriage. These seven brothers need to be firmly bound together and love one another. My desire, however, is not an order; if these brothers have the same desire, they will begin to love one another. If they accept this change and are bound together in the service, love will follow. They should love one another and not choose. Choosing will open a back door for the enemy to come in and work. I hope that these seven brothers will commit themselves into the Lord&rsquo;s hand, forget the past, coordinate together, and love one another. If they are willing to do this, they will be blessed.</p>
<p>Forgetting is a principle in the Bible. In forgiving us of our sins, God forgets our sins (Heb. 8:12). Therefore, we also should forgive one another (Eph. 4:32; Col. 3:13). In the Bible to forgive is to forget. Only when something is forgotten is it truly forgiven.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Paul says, &ldquo;One thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before&rdquo; (Phil. 3:13). In the future when we are in the new heaven and the new earth, we will only remember how we repented, got saved, enjoyed the Lord, and fellowshipped with the saints. We will not remember any hate, jealousy, or strife. We will remember the good things but have no memory of the bad things. Therefore, we should live in the new heaven and the new earth today. Second Corinthians 5:17 says, &ldquo;If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.&rdquo; When we forget the things that are behind, the things of yesterday, we will love one another.</p>
<p>If we do not have love but claim to be in spirit, we are performing. We must have love in order to be in spirit. To be in spirit is to be in Christ. I hope that the brothers who are coordinating and serving together would love one another. Love does not take account of evil and does not take account of people&rsquo;s shortcomings; love forgets the bad and forgets the past. If we would be in love, the local churches would be blessed, full of life, and enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence. We would benefit, and others would benefit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p><em>Question: Should the local churches have a children&rsquo;s work? We lack suitable children&rsquo;s materials.</em></p>
<p>Answer: The children&rsquo;s meeting is a very important service, but we must admit that we have not done enough in our localities. The responsible brothers in the various localities should pay attention to the children&rsquo;s work and endeavor to bring younger brothers and sisters into the children&rsquo;s service. It is not easy to prepare materials. Some of what we have written is not fitting. Other things that were written are good, but not enough copies were printed. The ones teaching the children in the various localities need to pray much. They must not use Sunday-school material from Christianity and must not give the children premature knowledge. Premature knowledge is damaging, not beneficial.</p>
<p>I hope that the churches in the various localities will pay attention to the children&rsquo;s work. This work is worthwhile and necessary. If we can work with the children and those in elementary school, junior high, and high school, we will have a good foundation in the young people&rsquo;s work. Time flies; a decade goes by fast. The children who are seven years old this year will be seventeen years old in a decade, and the children who are ten years old now will be twenty years old in a decade. The young people who are seventeen to twenty years old are very useful in the church. The children&rsquo;s work is more effective than bringing people in from the streets to hear the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THINGS TO AVOID IN COORDINATION</h2>
<p>Although there are troubles and sufferings in coordination, genuine coordination is very sweet. The key is with how we coordinate. The work of the ministry officially began in Taipei on August 1, 1949. On the one hand, we endeavored to help the church in Taipei; on the other hand, we helped build all the churches in Taiwan. From the beginning of the work we have avoided four things in our coordination. First, we avoided opinions. When the work began, I told the brothers who attended the service meetings and the elders&rsquo; meetings that in the administration of the church and the coordination in the work we must avoid opinions. We should not have opinions.</p>
<p>Second, we avoided the flesh. The flesh must never be involved in our coordination. As elders and co-workers, we must avoid and reject the flesh in any situation. Third, we avoided arguments. We should never argue. Fourth, we avoided strife. At that time I was taking the lead in the work, and by the Lord&rsquo;s grace we endeavored not to involve the flesh, not to argue, and not to be in strife. As a result, the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in Taiwan, including the administration of the church and the coordination in the work, began with a good foundation.</p>
<p>The first step in whatever we do is crucial. If the first step is right, the next steps will be easy. If the first step is wrong, it will be difficult to correct it afterward. If the abovementioned seven brothers understand their responsibility and are willing to be bound together, they must guard against the involvement of the flesh. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace they must by all means avoid ever involving the flesh. They must lay a good foundation. While ministering in the different localities, I have discovered that many elders do not have a good foundation in their bearing of responsibility and coordinating together, because the foundation that they laid involved arguments, contentions, and the flesh. Hence, it is difficult for their local church to go on.</p>
<p>After much prayer, I sense that the Lord wants us to give up our former ways and lay a new foundation. The change of responsible brothers in that locality is a special case. If all the localities imitate that locality, their imitation will be a dead ordinance. I hope that the brothers in the various localities will have a new beginning in bearing responsibility and coordinating.</p>
<p>In our coordination we should deal sincerely with one another, not with mere civility, and we should not involve opinions, the flesh, and contentions. The most beautiful thing in coordination is to love one another. We should have genuine love for one another, not an emotional, excited, superficial, fleshly, or factious love but love that is in Christ and in the Spirit.</p>
<p>I hope that every locality will have a basic, clear, clean, and pure foundation. Laying a good foundation is more valuable than anything else. Even going out to gain thousands of people is not as precious as a good foundation. The younger generation must remember this word and not lay a mixed foundation in their coordination. They must lay a pure and solid foundation without opinions, diplomacy, civility, the flesh, and strife. When a solid foundation is laid, proper persons will come to meet with us. If the foundation is improper, only improper persons will come. Birds of a feather flock together. A person will find and meet in a place that matches him. Therefore, we must lay a simple, pure, upright, and noble foundation in order to gain weighty and upright persons.</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that He has brought in some upright persons on this proper foundation. Those who are not upright cannot stay on this foundation, for they will be exposed if they stay. On a proper foundation without mixture, the flesh cannot rise up, no one can respond to the flesh, and gimmicks do not earn profit. Hence, the ones who come this way want life and the truth. If we have more life and truth and a firm foundation, the ones who come will be weighty.</p></body></html>
