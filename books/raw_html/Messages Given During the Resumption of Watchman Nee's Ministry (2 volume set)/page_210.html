<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY<br>IN THE BODY<br>AND THE BODY CONSCIOUSNESS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (22)</H1><P>Date:April 28, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY IN THE BODY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Restricted in Our Speaking</H2><P>A man learns restriction first through his speaking. It is most difficult for a man to control his tongue. A tongue that is under control only dares to speak words of the learned (Isa. 50:4). The first thing we have to see is that a person who is rebellious in his speaking is one who has given himself away.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not Speaking Reviling Words</H2><P>When I was in London, I met a couple who would not submit to the responsible brothers. The husband was a good man, and the wife was also a good sister. The only trouble was that they were too talkative. They testified that whenever they spoke contradicting words, their spirit became a contradicting spirit. We have to see today that, as soon as our words come out, our spirit comes out. Both 2 Peter and Jude as well talk about the matter of reviling. Reviling is done through our speaking. If we are not careful, and we revile the brothers ahead of us, the oneness of the church will be damaged.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Withstanding Reviling Words</H2><P>Those who take in reviling words bear the same responsibility as those who speak reviling words. It is one thing for a person to dump trash on others. It is another thing for a person to receive trash from others. One of the reasons the church is divided and damaged is that there are reviling words. In order for the church to maintain the oneness, the brothers and sisters have to withstand reviling words.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Example of Michael</H2><P>Michael was an archangel. In the beginning, he was under Satan. Although Satan fell, Michael did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him. Moses' body was probably left on the Mount of Transfiguration. Michael could not revile Satan. He could only say, "The Lord rebuke you" (Jude 9). He had to invoke a higher authority to rebuke Satan. From this we see the importance of our words.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Reviling Words Damaging the Body</H2><P>Some people's tongues are "waxed"; they are very cunning. This kind of people never know or understand the Body. They unconsciously damage the Body with their words. It is bad enough for a man to have a wound. But if one rubs sand on the wound, the hurt will be greater. The same is true when one speaks reviling words. If a man's tongue is not under control, all other kinds of controls are useless (James 3:2). Man's tongue is the most cunning of all things. A double-tongued person will soon find that he has no one he can perfect; he will have turned away every possible person he could have perfected. If you are an inquisitive person and one with an itching ear, you would want others to talk to you and to entertain you. But those who have learned the lessons should rebuke you to your face. One needs not go on speaking when he is in front of an inquisitive person; his words can stop right there.</P>
