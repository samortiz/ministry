   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRIDE INVITING DESTRUCTION,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HUMILITY BRINGING IN BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is also much pride in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is painful to hear the questions: Why is he an elder, and I am not?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why is he leading the whole church, and I am leading only a group meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Pride is a source of suspicion, and it causes a person to think that the elders highly regard others but not him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If this is our condition, we may be able to give wonderful messages, but our work will have no result.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The primary matter is our person, not the way we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The ability to preach better than Paul will not make our work more effective.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everything depends on our person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A proud person will bring forth others who are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We bear fruit according to our kind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We reap what we sow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One who ministers the word with pride should not expect to reap the fruit of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One who administrates the church with pride should not expect to reap a church of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we administrate the church with pride, it may rise up to condemn and even reject us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The presence of such conditions among us gives us a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must see what God is doing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Someone might proudly say, Behold!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of these have been saved through me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may have led many to salvation, but they may all be sick, because we are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this way we damage the church and have no way to prevent the spread of our sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who love the Lord will not praise us for our work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we hope to be equally loved and praised by those who love and praise the Lord, we will reap the fruit of our labor one day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Matthew 7 the Lord said, Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And then I will declare to them: I never knew you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In these verses never knew means never approved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord did not approve what these ones did.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we should always ask ourselves whether our preaching the gospel is for the building and whether our administration of the church is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may think that we are competent in administrating the church, but after three years the church will be in rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May the Lord have mercy on us to see that the spirit of Babel is rebellion, which is intolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we can humbly receive mercy, we will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May the Lord have mercy on us to deliver us from the spirit of Babel that we may be humble and submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The seed of pride within all of us is the greatest problem to the Lord in His building work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the source of our lack of building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we want to be built, we must submit to others and accommodate them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Submission requires humility; accommodation requires meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A person who is neither submissive nor accommodating is proud, feeling that he can do everything by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>LEARNING IN SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>BEING HUMBLE IN RELATION TO OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>AND PURE TOWARD OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no position in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not expect others to exalt us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A brother once said that if those who serve the Lord were respected, many would rise up to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the contrary, when the Lord s servants are despised, a multitude rises up to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In our service there is no such thing as position, and we should not covet position.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not expect to be highly regarded or appreciated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should be prepared to be ill-treated without any appreciation for our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our reward is not from men.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This, however, is not our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Formerly we were clear that our pathway was contrary to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We were clear that this was not the pathway for those who desire glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not say that those who serve the Lord should be respected in order to attract others to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Such an atmosphere proves that we are in degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even if we are not respected, others will continually rise up to serve the Lord; they cannot be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must realize that everything is of God and that He bears full responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God has led us to walk this way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is His doing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot stir others up or control them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is shameful for someone to use financial means to control others or even to control the Lord s servants.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord wants us to see that all the work depends on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The way we are treated by others is secondary and should not bother us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Those who serve the Lord need to be prepared to place everything in His hands and live only to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God bears full responsibility for our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We live by faith even if we must make tents like Paul Acts 18:3; 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need to be humble and pure as we serve.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To be humble is to put ourselves aside and submit to God s arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To be pure is to acknowledge that everything comes from God; we have no motives or expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We take this way whether people praise or oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we are appreciated, we take this path; when we are not appreciated, we still take this path.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We take this way whether others agree or disagree.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Walking on this pathway is altogether a matter between God and us; it has nothing to do with anyone or anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those who serve the Lord should be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Toward the end of Paul s ministry, he said, All who are in Asia turned away from me, and at my first defense no one was with me to support me, but all abandoned me 2 Tim 1:15; 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It seems that Paul was saying that many received his ministry, but no one stood with him at his first defense.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Nevertheless, the Lord stood with him and empowered him so that through him the proclamation of the gospel might be fully accomplished v. 17 . In our service we should not desire to win the sympathy of others.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Our way is in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All those who serve the Lord need to be humble in relation to themselves and pure toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They should not long for sympathy from the brothers and sisters, and they should not expect a high position, nice treatment, compliments, or positive responses.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must be pure in our goal of seeking only God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must also be humble and submit to others and to our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We serve the Lord and those who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If the Lord could wash the disciples feet, who can we not serve?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If the Lord could go to Hades, where can we not serve?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Whether we serve in a large or small locality and whether we serve as elders to administrate the church or only clean the restrooms, we need to endeavor in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Only in this way can we do the work of building.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This kind of service will produce an organic result of building.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Otherwise, our service may only produce giants.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Please remember that we reap what we sow.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Satan is doing a subtle work to cause us to be individualistic and in discord even though we do not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hence, we work with one hand and tear down with the other.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In such a situation it is difficult for us to have the blessing; it is difficult for our work to produce an organic result.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God s blessing is on the one accord and the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Genuine oneness comes with the building.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we are built, we can be with the brothers in any locality, under any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Whether we are an elder or sweep the floor, we will serve with thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We will be flexible in our coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we learn this lesson before God, our serving as elders will result in the building up of the church, and our cleaning the meeting hall will also result in the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Then no matter which book the elders want us to pursue, whether it is the Gospel of John or the Epistles to the Thessalonians, we will have no preference.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>As long as we are those who are being built, no matter where we are placed or what we are asked to do, we are in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Everything depends on whether we are being built by the Lord, not on whether we are asked to minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The full-time serving brothers do not earn their livelihood by preaching; rather, they are those who have sacrificed their future to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>May we be those who are in the Lord s heart and learn to receive His breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>May we say as Sister M. E. Barber said, Lord, I have no other desire than You.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>THE GENUINE BROTHERLY LOVE BEING THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Another reason for the lack of building among the serving ones is that we are short of love for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This shortage of mutual love causes my heart to ache.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>There is no genuine love among us, and we do not care much for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It seems as though we are satisfied with merely getting along with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>It is as if we are merely colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Without brotherly love, however, we will lose the testimony and the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>There should be an extraordinary love among the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This is a crucial point in John 13 through 17.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The Lord s word to us and His prayer for us was to love one another 13:34; 15:12, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Such a love for one another comes from our oneness with the Lord, and it is not something ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This is to love one another in the Lord s divine life and in the Lord s love 17:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Only this kind of love can build us up.</S>
