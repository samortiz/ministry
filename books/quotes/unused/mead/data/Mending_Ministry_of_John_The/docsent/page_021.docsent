   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MANY ABODES IN THE FATHER'S HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"In My Father's house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be" John 14:2, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Father's house, we know from 2:16, was the temple, which today is the church, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In God's house there are many abodes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word translated abodes is the noun form of the verb abide.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every member of the church is an abode, or a room, in God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord was intimating to His disciples that by His death and resurrection He would prepare rooms for them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is clear from verse 23, where the word abode again is used.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By comparing this verse with verse 2 we can clearly see that the abodes in God's house are those who love the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must interpret the Bible by the Bible, not according to our natural, religious, or traditional concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who love the Lord will be an abode for the Father and for the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That the church today is the Father's house we know from 1 Timothy 3:15: "But if I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All we who are members are abodes in this house, which was prepared by Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord passed through death and entered into resurrection in order to prepare the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He thus cleared away every obstacle and released the riches of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without His death and resurrection there would have been no way for us to be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were hindered by sins, the flesh, the old creation, worldliness, and the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But by His death and resurrection He took away sins, destroyed the Devil, and released the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus He prepared the church, making us all abodes in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not consider the Father's house in John 14 as a place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yes, the Lord did say that He was going to prepare a place for us, but this place is not a lifeless space.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This place is actually a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is apparent from verses 5 and 6, where the Lord told Thomas that He Himself was the way to this place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the way to the place is a Person, the place also must be a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The way is a living Person, and this way leads us to a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This living Person is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you know that the church is the enlargement of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ Himself is the living way, leading us to the church, which is His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The personal Christ is the way leading us to the enlarged Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No doubt what I have said conflicts with how these verses have been traditionally interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was taught that the Father's house is in heaven, where there is a golden street.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus went there to prepare us a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Over nineteen hundred years have gone by, and still that mansion is not completed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Think what a splendid mansion that will be, that after so many years it is still not finished!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what the Brethren taught.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believed it and thanked the Lord for the wonderful mansion He was still working on.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It must not yet be finished because He had promised He would come back and receive me there; since He still had not returned, He must still be laboring on it!</S>
