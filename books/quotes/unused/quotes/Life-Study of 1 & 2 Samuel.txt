To understand the Bible as the divine revelation, we need a spirit of wisdom to know and a spirit of revelation to see
Today we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know and to see the things which are covered, hidden, concealed
These three books are not merely books of history; they are a part of the divine revelation concerning God's economy
In these books are a number of types, which are pictures, portraits, showing us how we can participate in God's economy
These books are part of the revelation concerning God's economy and contain pictures related to our participation in God's economy
For this life-study of 1 and 2 Samuel, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see what is revealed in these two books
David's godly life secured the kingship in God's economy, and his indulgence contaminated the kingship of God's holiness
Because the priesthood at the time of Eli was stale and was waning, Samuel was raised up to replace the stale and waning priesthood
Saul's fleshly life caused him to lose the kingship, but David's godly life secured the kingship in the divine economy
He initiated the prophethood to replace the waning priesthood in the speaking for God, terminated the judgeship, and brought in the kingship
His heart is not that we always please Him and make Him happy, nor that we should be good, spiritual, holy, or victorious
When some hear this, they may argue, pointing out that different portions of the Bible exhort us to be patient, humble, and perfect
Such a cooperation is related to the personal enjoyment of the good land, which typifies the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ
1 and 2 Samuel are a continuation of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, giving us the details concerning the enjoyment of the God-given good land
The runners in such a race must run in pairs, with each partner having one leg bound to one of his partner's legs
The books of 1 and 2 Samuel have three sections the history concerning Samuel the history concerning Saul and the history concerning David
We need to enjoy Christ to such an extent that our enjoyment of Christ becomes the kingdom of God in which we reign in life with Christ
In this message we will begin to consider the history concerning Samuel, beginning with his origin, birth, and youth
In the midst of the chaos of the degraded Israel, Elkanah and Hannah remained in the line of life ordained by God for His eternal purpose
Elkanah and Hannah remained in this line of life not merely for God's eternal salvation but for His eternal purpose
Under God's sovereign dealing, Hannah was suppressed in her soul with a burden in her spirit to pour out before Jehovah
In a very particular way, the origin of Samuel was the moving God with His answer to the prayer of Samuel's mother
After such a prayer as Hannah prayed it was easy for God to do something because mans cooperation had become a base on which He could move
The moving God answered the prayer of Samuel's mother according to His desire and intention for His move among His elect
God's move in response to Hannah's prayer was in keeping with the principle that God needs man's cooperation with His move in His economy
God's move with His answer to Hannah's prayer was to produce a Nazarite who was absolute for the fulfilling of His desire
A Nazarite not only submits to God as the authority but also has no interest in the enjoyment of worldly pleasures
If we would be today's Nazarites, we must take God as our Head and Husband, submitting to Him, and have no interest in worldly pleasures
In his youth, perhaps at the age of two or three, Samuel was offered to Jehovah by his mother to fulfill her vow to God
Her prayer was related to God's move in His economy and indicated that she realized something concerning God's economy
In the Lord's recovery today, we also need support, and we thank the Lord for the many mothers in the church life
In the New Testament we cannot find such fine, detailed lessons concerning the enjoyment of Christ for the fulfilling of God's economy
The two sons of Eli despised the offerings of Jehovah and took the best flesh of the people's offerings by force
We should never stay in a private room with a member of the other sex with the windows covered and the doors closed
We should not think that God is merely sitting in the heavens and is not doing anything about the situation of His people on earth
At the time of Hezekiah Judah looked to the Lord for protection and one night He sent an angel to strike 185000 in the camp of the Assyrians
In their situation they should have repented, made a thorough confession, and returned to God from their idols
The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, who had gone out with the ark, were killed because they had altogether disregarded God
When the news came to him that the ark had been captured, he fell off his seat backward, broke his neck, and died
Samuel observed all these tragedies, and they became lessons to him, warning him and reminding him throughout his service to God
When he was about to die, he could remind the people of Israel that he had never defrauded them, oppressed them, or taken anything from them
While Samuel was under Eli's custody, God taught him in a very fine way, built him up, and established him as His proper priest
As such a priest, Samuel became a judge to judge Israel, a prophet to prophesy for God, and the one to bring forth the kingship
In reading the Bible we need to have a clear view of God's economy and understand everything in the Bible in relation to God's economy
Samuel observed the misfortune of the ark of God under the superstition of the degraded and rotten Aaronic priesthood
As Samuel observed all these things, he must have received a deep impression, and these things became an education to him
The ark of God was usurped by the elders of the people of Israel, who were degraded from the line of God's economy
Before bringing the ark of God out of the tabernacle, they should have checked with God as Joshua did at Jericho
Today many Christians usurp God by praying for their prosperity, health, or family without any consideration of God's economy
If God intends that you continue living on earth for His economy, you will be healed, either through a physician or through some other way
The point here is that, instead of usurping God, we must pray, live, and be persons according to God's heart and for His economy
A short time after the children of Israel brought out the ark of God, they were defeated, and the ark was captured
Also, at that time Eli's daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, delivered her child and called him Ichabod, which means 'No glory'
After the Philistines brought the ark to Ashdod, they brought it into the house of Dagon and set it next to Dagon
Dagon's head and the palms of his hands were cut off, lying on the threshold; only Dagon's trunk was left to him'
When the ark of God came there, the Ekronites cried out that the ark of the God of Israel had been brought to them in order to kill them
In chapter six we see that the ark suffered another removal, from the Philistines back to Israel, arriving at Beth-shemesh
The bringing out of the ark by the elders of Israel and the returning of the ark by the Philistines both were superstitious
They told them to send the ark away that it might go and to watch to see if it went toward its own border at Beth-shemesh
God protected His holiness, not allowing the Philistines or the people of Beth-shemesh to do whatever they liked with the ark
Eventually the people of Bethshemesh asked the people of Kiriathjearim to come and take the ark and the ark remained there for twenty years
At least we may say that Samuel was the representative of the very God in heaven to rule over His people on earth
Samuel, who was by nature a Levite born of one of the descendants of the great rebel Korah , ministered in five statuses
Samuel had a clear view of God's economy and also of what the enemy had been doing to devastate God's economy on earth
Samuel could be qualified to such an extent because for many years God had been perfecting him for His economy, not for anything else
Rather, as saints in the Lord's recovery, we should expect that through us the Lord will do as much as possible to accomplish His economy
Samuel was established by God to speak the word of God to replace the teaching of the word of God by the old priesthood
The breastplate and the Urim and the Thummim worn by the high priest were the means used by God to speak to His people
Of course, Abraham was a prophet speaking for God, but in God's ordained way Samuel was the first prophet to set up a prophethood
According to verse 2, Samuel's first prophesying was also at a time when the waning Eli's eyesight was so dim that he could not see
Applying this to today's situation, we may say that in degraded Catholicism and Protestantism there is still a little enlightening
At the time of chapter three, Samuel 'did not yet know Jehovah, and the word of Jehovah had not yet been revealed to him'
As described in verses 4 through 9, Samuel had a new experience: Jehovah called to him, and he began to hear Jehovah's speaking
Samuel stood on the earth to be the acting God the one representing God and acting for Him in his priesthood, prophethood, and judgeship
The judgeship actually belonged to the priesthood for the priesthood included the two matters of speaking for God and administrating for God
Because the old Aaronic priesthood was waning, God raised up Samuel to be a new priest, a new prophet, and a new judge
Christ's coming to earth was the greatest event in the universe, and credit for this should be given to Samuel
Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen; and he called its name Eben-ezer and said, Thus far Jehovah has helped us'
We need to realize that God's helping us is for His fulfillment of His economy and that we are enjoying the blessing in this fulfillment
In the Old Testament, only Moses and Samuel were qualified to participate fully in the priesthood, the prophethood, and the judgeship
The sons of Samuel should not be considered judges among the people of Israel, and their father Samuel should be considered the last judge
The unjust ways of Samuel's sons gave the people of Israel cause to ask him to appoint a king to judge them like all the nations
By asking Samuel to appoint a king to judge them, the people of Israel displeased him and caused him to pray for them
From the first generation of the human race, man has been rejecting God as the King, the Head, and the Husband
The people of Israel not only displeased Samuel but also offended God by rejecting Him as their King for a replacement
In 12:12 Samuel said, 'You said to me, No; but a king will reign over us, though Jehovah your God was your King'
Samuel did what God charged him, speaking 'all the words of Jehovah to the people, who had asked him for a king'
Samuel heard all the words of the people and then consulted Jehovah, speaking their words in the hearing of Jehovah
We may do good things, but those good things are evil in the sight of God as long as we reject Him as our Head, our Husband, and our King
It is not a matter of good or bad, right or wrong; it is a matter of whether we take God as our King or reject Him
When we argue with our spouse, the only way to settle the disagreement is to stop arguing and come to our King, our Head
Concerning any problem related to God's economy, we should stop any quarreling, struggling, debating, and reasoning and go to our Head
Samuel was a man who turned the age in God's administration from the age of the priesthood to the age of the prophethood with the kingship
If you are not one of the elders and you see something in the church that is not so right, you should never criticize, oppose, or gossip
If, in His mercy to His church, the Lord gives you a word, a prophecy, then you should go to the elders and prophesy to them
The elders, realizing that they hold the kingship, should learn that they are not all-capable, that they may be deficient
The priesthood was to minister the word of God to His people and to exercise the authority of God over His people
Today, this is the proper way to take care of the church teaching to speak for God and taking the lead to exercise God's authority
God replaced it with the uplifted prophethood to speak God's word to His people and the kingship to rule over God's people
At the end of his ministry, by the time that Saul was raised up to be the king in Israel , Samuel had reached the highest position
Rather, according to the Bible, God determined to raise up a man named David, through whom He intended to build up a kingdom
When God chose Abraham, it was not His intention to gain a single person or even a group of people who would seek after Him
As a man who was according to God's heart, Samuel knew that within God's heart there was a desire for a kingdom
Because he had no intention to build up a kingdom for his descendants, Samuel's concern was not for his children but for God's people
As we will see in the next message, the day before Saul came to Samuel, God revealed to Samuel what He wanted him to do
As a Nazarite, who allowed no razor to come upon his head and who did not drink any wine, he was absolutely for God
Although it was not easy for Samuel to stand for God in his particular environment, he cared for God's interest and he turned the age
God did not go directly to David because David was still young and because Israel, whom God loved to the uttermost, needed some training
In order for God to reach the time of incarnation, there had to be some preparation, and Samuel was a part of that preparation
When Kish, Saul's father, learned that his donkeys were lost, he asked his son to take one of the servants and go to search for the donkeys
It was a difficult task to find the donkeys, for no one knew where they went, and it is likely that there was no way to trace them
The servant said to him, 'There is a man of God here in this city, and he is a man held in honor; all that he says happens without fail
God's anointing of Saul happened by Saul's meeting Samuel under God's arrangement and God's call through Samuel
Jehovah had foretold to Samuel that He would send Saul to him, whom Samuel was to anoint as the leader over His people Israel
Samuel told Saul that he would encounter a group of prophets who would be prophesying and that the Spirit of Jehovah would rush upon him
Saul told him the part about the donkeys, but 'he did not tell him about the matter of the kingdom that Samuel had spoken of'
Whereas the others brought presents to celebrate Saul's kingship, these worthless men refused to participate in the celebration
Saul, the son of Kish, had gone to search for the lost donkeys and he returned to his father with the kingship
Saul, who was very tall and handsome, matched Israel's human concept of a king, and they immediately recognized him as the king
Nahash the Ammonite encamped against Jabesh-gilead, and the men of Jabesh told him that if he made a treaty with them, they would serve him
The elders of Jabesh asked for seven days' respite to see if there was one who could save them, and they sent messengers to Gibeah of Saul
Saul forgave his despisers, saying, 'No man shall be put to death on this day, for today Jehovah has accomplished deliverance in Israel'
Saul behaved in an attractive way and gained the heart of the people, but Samuel was clear concerning Saul's real situation
All the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before Jehovah and sacrificed peace offerings before Jehovah
He reminded them that he had not taken anything from them, defrauded them, oppressed them, or taken any bribe from them
He said, 'Jehovah is Witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand'
Samuel reminded the people of his integrity and then went on to speak to them of Jehovah's righteous acts for Israel
He reminded them that it was Jehovah who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought their fathers up out of the land of Egypt
Finally, Samuel reminded Israel of their wickedness in asking for a king, though Jehovah their God was their King
Because they wanted a king as a replacement for God, they would not have the proper enjoyment of the good land
After Sauls conquest of the Ammonites the people were happy but they had been deceived by Saul and Samuel was not happy about this situation
Samuel seemed to be saying to Israel, 'You should have remained under the kingship of God, taking Him as your Husband and your Head
Verses 19 through 25 record the people's confession of their sin and Samuel's charge to them and his praying for them
The people confessed their sin, saying that they had added to all their sins the evil of asking for a king for themselves
Samuel charged the people of Israel not to turn away from following Jehovah but to serve Him with all their heart
Samuel said, 'Only, fear Jehovah and serve Him in truth with all your heart, for consider what great things He has done for you
Caring for God's elect was a crucial aspect of the history concerning Samuel, which was in sharp contrast to the history concerning Saul
In the first conquest he behaved in a kind humble manner but in the second conquest he behaved in a way that caused him to lose his kingship
As we will see, Samuel's intention, which was according to God's heart, was to build the kingdom of God on earth
Saul disobeyed, offering up a sinful offering, yet he complained against Samuel that Samuel had not come at the appointed time
Saul's excuse for his disobedience was that the people were scattered from him and that the Philistines assembled themselves for fighting
Moses gave the law to the children of Israel, but before Samuel came they did not have a set of by-laws, a constitution
Recently, a monarchy was built up in a certain area of this country, but the saints there refused to go along with such a monarchy
Through the past several decades, some brothers have worked and labored very well, and we appreciate what they have done
There are signs that the work in these places is not a pure work a work purely for the building up of the Body of Christ, the kingdom of God
Every local church has its own freedom and jurisdiction to make decisions concerning, for example, the times of the meetings
At that time, Israel was under the strict control of the Philistines, who did not allow them to make swords or spears
Jonathan trusted in Jehovah for his victory , believing that there was no constraint on Jehovah to save by many or by few
According to verse 16 the multitude of the Philistine army was melting away, and they were going here and there
Even all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country followed Saul and Jonathan closely in the battle
In the oath he laid on the people, Saul cursed any man who ate food before the evening, when Saul would be avenged of his enemies
Saul corrected the people in that sin and asked them to slay their oxen and sheep and eat before him that night
Saul sought God's leading for him and the people of Israel to pursue after the Philistines, and God did not answer him that day
Saul took the kingdom over Israel and fought against all his enemies all around Moab, Ammon, Edom, Zobah, and the Philistines
When we are in the flesh we may be critical of certain elders or our flesh may be so bothered that we may even consider leaving the recovery
Eventually, the Amalekites rose up to frustrate the establishing of God's kingdom, and Saul was charged to destroy them
Jehovah sent you on a journey and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed
Why then did you not obey the voice of Jehovah, but flew upon the spoil and did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah'?
Samuel seemed to be saying, 'Saul, you say that you spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to Jehovah, my God
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed, to take care of, God's speaking is better than the fat of rams
What you did was just as evil as contacting an evil spirit for the purpose of carrying out the intention of that spirit, not God's intention
You did not subordinate yourself to God as your Head but acted presumptuously, according to your ways and by your will
Samuel went on to say, 'Moreover the Eminence of Israel does not lie nor repent, for He is not a man that He should repent'
We should be warned by this account of Saul's disobedience not to do anything in the kingdom of God by our flesh
We thank the Lord that, under His mercy, He has opened up the intrinsic secrets in the Word to show us the real lessons
In the first verse of chapter sixteen, God sent Samuel to contact a young boy, who was perhaps only about fifteen years old
He usurped and even abused the gifts given to him by God the kingdom, the people, and the kingship in order to build up his own monarchy
Verse 14 says that the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul and that an evil spirit from Jehovah terrorized him
The more he saw the good points of David, the more he realized that the kingdom would not go to his son Jonathan but to David
Saul was exposed as a person who was opposite to God's will, and David was manifested to be a man according to God's heart
The armies of the Philistines and the men of Israel were assembled in array and were ready to engage in a war against one another
David was sent by his father to strengthen his brothers with food and to greet them and to get some news about them
Goliath scorned him for being but a youth and considered that his coming to him was as one with staves coming to chase away a dog
Goliath then cursed David by his gods and said that he would give David's flesh to the birds of heaven and to the beasts of the field
David's victory over Goliath and the Philistines was a strong confirmation to God's choosing and anointing of him
We all need to realize that because we are pursuing Christ today, every aspect of our environment is absolutely under God's sovereign hand
If God had not provided Jonathan in such a way, it is doubtful that David could have endured the trials under Saul
On the one hand, we have the trials; on the other hand, we have God's provision to support us and sustain us in the trials
Suppose that in a particular church five brothers are taking the lead, but thus far no one has been officially appointed to be an elder
These two brothers might say, 'The five of us have been laboring together to take care of the church, but we two have been set aside
Otherwise, they may become cold to the church and withdraw, no longer continuing faithfully in the church life
Galatians 5 not only speaks of this war but also says They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts
When Saul learned that another daughter, Michal, loved David, Saul plotted to give her to David as wife that she might be a snare to him
When the princes of the Philistines went forth against Israel, David succeeded more than all the servants of Saul
Also, Jonathan promised David that he would speak about him to Saul and then tell David anything that he might learn
Jonathan appeased Saul concerning David by relating all the marvelous deeds David had done for Saul and for all Israel
Saul tried to strike David to the wall while David was playing the lyre to Saul when Saul was troubled by an evil spirit from God
Saul sent messengers three times to seize David, and each time the Spirit of God came upon the messengers to cause them to prophesy
It would be a shame for us to say that we are in the Lord's recovery, yet we do not know that there is a God-ordained order
We should just live Christ in the spirit that we may live a church life according to the divine, ordained order
Let us now see what is recorded in 1 Samuel 21 through 24 concerning David's being persecuted and tried by Saul
The Lord Jesus referred to this when the Pharisees came to Him, saying, 'Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath'
He answered them by reminding them that David and his companions had eaten of the holy bread of God's presence
Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?
Is this not him of whom they sang to one another in dances, saying, Saul has stricken down his thousands;/But David, his ten thousands'?
There was no place for this God-fearing and God-loving man to remain in the land of Immanuel, the land of Christ
When Gad the prophet told him to depart and go into the land of Judah, David went into the forest of Hereth of Judah
David hurried to get away from Saul, while Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men in order to capture them
When Saul returned from following the Philistines he was told where David was and Saul took three thousand choice men and went to seek David
If he had rebelled against Saul, then he would have been to the people an example of rebellion against the God-ordained, appointed king
What David did here was exactly what the New Testament teaches concerning not repaying evil for evil but overcoming evil with good
Finally, David's God-fearing and God-honoring life subdued the reckless Saul and stopped Saul from pursuing him
Apart from the help rendered by Jonathan and Michal, David could not have endured being persecuted and tried by Saul
The New Testament revelation emphasizes the fact that, on the one hand, Christ is in us and that, on the other hand, we are in Christ
The entering of Noah and his family into the ark, a type of Christ, illustrates that our Christ today is enterable
We have seen that when David was persecuted by Saul he did not react in a negative way and he did not complain condemn criticize or oppose
We need to learn two vital lessons the lesson of God's sovereignty and the lesson of taking the cross with the power of resurrection
The more we learn the lessons of God's sovereignty and of taking the cross, the more we will be the gainers and the enjoyers
Samuel died a peaceful death after the proper and full enjoyment of his portion in the good land promised by God
From his youth in the tabernacle until the time of his death, Samuel enjoyed the good land in every way and in every sense
Samuel became a priest, a prophet, and a judge to usher in the Davidic kingdom for the accomplishment of God's economy on the earth
Although Samuel was disappointed with Saul's kingship, he died with the encouraging expectation of David's kingship
If David had taken the cross in this situation, he might have praised the Lord for Nabal's refusal to provide food
It may be easy for us to prevail in bearing the bigger crosses, but we may be careless in bearing the smaller crosses
In verses 5 through 16 we see that whereas Jehovah delivered Saul into the hand of David, David would not kill him
Although David was weak in losing his temper with Nabal and in taking Abigail his wife in dealing with Saul David was an outstanding success
David begged Saul not to drive him out so that he could not share in Jehovah's inheritance, the good land, but go to serve other gods
Saul did not say anything about the kingship or kingdom, because he still wanted his son Jonathan to succeed him as king
God wanted to build up His kingdom among His chosen people, but Saul usurped God's kingdom to build up his own monarchy
After Saul was appointed to be the king, he was immediately filled with thoughts of the kingship, including how his son would succeed him
Because Saul was given up by God, he was left alone, like an orphan, having no provision of help when trouble came
Even though David was the most skillful and experienced fighter, he was of no use to Saul because of Saul's selfishness and envy
Samuel 28:3a tells us that Samuel was dead and that all Israel had mourned for him and had buried him in his own city, Ramah
Since mediums and soothsayers contact evil spirits, Saul did a good thing in having them removed from the country of Israel
Here in chapter twenty-eight Saul practiced divination, which involves contact with evil spirits and is even worse than idol worship
Samuel told Saul that Jehovah had torn the kingdom out from his hand and had given it to David, an associate of his
In chapter twenty-nine David was sovereignly kept away by God from joining the Philistines' camp to fight against Israel
The lords of the Philistines refused to have David go with them into battle against Israel, and Achish therefore sent him away
Under God's sovereignty, David saved himself from the turmoil of his men in losing their families to the Amalekites
The Amalekites had conquered Ziklag and burned it and captured all the women, including the families of David's men and his two wives
The soul of all the people was bitter, and they spoke of stoning David, but he 'strengthened himself in Jehovah his God'
David and four hundred of his men pursued the Amalekites, with the assistance of a young man of Egypt who was a servant of an Amalekite
The provision of the help from this Egyptian indicates that the details of David's environment were under God's sovereignty
Eventually, David conquered the Amalekites and captured their captives, delivering all that the Amalekites had taken
David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before the other cattle and of which they said, This is David's spoil'
David shared the spoil with the two hundred men who had not been able to follow him in pursuing the Amalekites
Concerning this David said As his share is who goes down to the battle so shall his share be who stays by the baggage they shall share alike
Finally, according to verses 26 through 31, David sent presents from his spoil to his friends and the friends of his men in many cities
Without David there would not have been the genealogy through which Christ as God became a man to be one with mankind
If David had been destroyed, the genealogy of Christ would have been terminated, and God would not have had a way to carry out His economy
Under God's sovereignty this persecuted one became flourishing and was established in the good land to enjoy God's portion
Davids situation became brighter and brighter whereas Sauls situation became darker and darker until with his sons he died a tragic death
We should not be today's Saul, considering only the work in our region and trying to build up a monarchy for ourselves
According to His desire God made an economy, and according to His economy He created the heavens and the earth with man as the center
Through the process of incarnation He entered into humanity, making Himself, the divine One, one with humanity
In ascension as the consummated Triune God He remains the complete God mingled with the perfect man the God-man
Today as the consummated God He is the Spirit, our life, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Master, our Lord, our Father, and our God
The next day the Philistines came to strip the slain and they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa
In order to please David he told him that he saw Saul leaning on his spear and that Saul had asked him to kill him and that he had done so
David sang a dirge over Saul and over Jonathan his son, and he commanded that The Song of the Bow be taught to the children of Judah
In the Lord's recovery we must be in fear and trembling, always working for God's kingdom and not for our own work
These books reveal the right, the particular, and even the full way for us to enjoy Christ that we may be a part of God's economy
Concerning this we need to realize that God desires people who are according to Him, people who are His duplication
In the long period of history covered in 1 Samuel 1 to 2 Samuel 1, there are five major figures: Eli, Samuel, Jonathan, Saul, and David
A descendant of Aaron, who was chosen to be God's priest, Eli was a priest by birth according to God's ordination
As a priest Eli had the right to enjoy the top portion of all the good land allotted to the twelve tribes of Israel
As a priest-prophet, he spoke for God honestly and initiated the prophethood to replace the fading priesthood in the divine revelation
Jonathan loved David, covenanted with him, and predicted that he would be the second in David's kingdom when David would be the king
In typology, for Jonathan to follow David would have signified our following Christ today and our giving Him the preeminence
Saul might have been helped by Jonathan not to build up a monarchy for himself but to build up the kingdom of God
Because Jonathan would not leave his father, he suffered the same fate as his father and died with him in the battle
To practice divination is to have contact with evil spirits, something that is utterly contrary to God's principle
While he was under the trial, he was approved to be the right one to carry out God's economy by establishing the kingdom of God on the earth
The fact that David would not do anything to damage God's anointed indicates that David maintained a good order in God's kingdom
When David inquired of Jehovah whether he should go up into one of the cities of Judah, Jehovah told him to go up to Hebron
They dwelt in the cities of Hebron, and there in Hebron the men of Judah anointed David king over the house of Judah
In verses 8 through 10a we see that Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, at the age of forty rivaled David in the kingship
Verse 17 says, 'The battle was very severe that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were routed before the servants of David'
In this battle nineteen of David's servants plus Asahel were missing, and the servants of David killed 360 men of Ish-bosheth
While there was war between the house of David and the house of Saul, Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul
David said that he would make a covenant with him, and then he requested Abner to bring Saul's daughter Michal his wife to him
While all the events recorded in these chapters were taking place, God was present in His sovereignty behind the scene
When the boy's nurse received the news that Saul and Jonathan had died in the battle against the Philistines, she took up the child and fled
The two sons of Rimmon the Beerithite murdered Ish-bosheth and brought his head to David in Hebron to please him
He told them about what he had done to the one who thought that he was bringing good news by telling him that Saul had died
In Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah for thirty-three years
The history concerning David, particularly the record in 1 Samuel 18:1 through 2 Samuel 5:25, reveals that our God is sovereign
Without anyone seeing or knowing, God takes care of everything according to His will to accomplish His economy
A number of matters in 2 Samuel 5:6-25 are evidence that God had established David and had exalted his kingdom
The first of these is recorded in verses 6 through 8, where we see that David was established by God in his victory over the Jebusites
If in any matter we do not have the inner sense that the Lord is with us, we must be careful and consider our way
We all need to learn the lesson of caring for these two things: the inward presence of God and the outward confirmation in our environment
In Exodus 17 the children of Israel fought a war against the Amalekites in a particular way under two leaders Moses and Joshua
Eventually, David, the one who killed Goliath and defeated the Philistines, became friends with Achish, a king of the Philistines
The Philistines were very close to God's people, yet they were worldly and handled the things of God in a worldly way
Today, we are troubled mainly by these two things: the flesh within and the worldly Christianity in our environment
As we will see, in chapter six David took care of the habitation of the ark of God, and in chapter seven he wanted to build a house for God
As a man according to God's heart, David desired to prepare a place where God could settle Himself down on this earth
In order to understand adequately David's taking care of the habitation of the ark of God, we need to review the history of the ark of God
The ark, which was made of acacia wood covered with gold, was a type of Christ as the embodiment of the moving and working God
The ark was placed in the inner chamber of the tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, and thus became the center of the tabernacle
The ark was respected to the uttermost by the Jewish people because they considered that the ark was God's presence
The ark was made by Moses according to God's design in order to contain the law on the two tables as the testimony of God
The ark was removed from Beth-shemesh to Kiriath-jearim and was put into the house of Abinadab and stayed there for twenty years
The ark of God was removed from the house of Abinadab, and David and all the house of Israel played on musical instruments before Jehovah
God did not condemn the worldly Philistines for using a cart to move the ark, but He would not tolerate the same action by His people
The anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him there for his error; and he died there by the ark of God'
The death of Uzzah frightened David very much, and he did not want to remove the ark of God to himself in the city of David
In verses 11 through 23 we see that David removed the ark from the house of Obed-edom and brought it to his city, Zion
Verse 15 tells us that David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet
David offered sacrifices before Jehovah, blessing the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts and apportioning to all the people some cakes
God charged Nathan to tell David that He took him from the pasture, from following the sheep, that he might be ruler over His people Israel
God promised David that He would make a great name for him, 'like the name of the great ones who are on the earth'
David's heart was to get a place for God to dwell in, but God's heart is to get a place for His people to be settled and even planted
When we resolve to do something for the Lord, we may have the sense deep within us that we need the Lord to do more for us
In 2 Samuel 7:12 God was actually telling David that instead of building something for God, he needed God to build His Son into him
We will tell them that they are short of something and that what they need is Christ, the very God Himself, to be wrought into their being
As such a One, He is now being built, constituted, into us, making us a part of Him, even as He has made Himself a part of us
Samuel 7:13 reveals that it is Christ who will build a house for God's name, and God will establish the throne of Christ's kingdom forever
Samuel 714b15 says that if Davids seed committed iniquity God would strike him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men
Solomon did commit serious sin, and God chastised him because of it, but God's lovingkindness nevertheless remained with the house of David
In verse 16 God said to David, 'Your house and your kingdom will be made sure forever before you; your throne will be established forever'
In verses 18 through 21 David thanked God for all the great things He had done to him for His word's sake and according to His own heart
In verse 24 David said, 'You have established Your people Israel to be a people to You forever, and You, O Jehovah, became their God'
Samuel 7 is a very difficult portion of the Word to understand, and not many Christians have the proper view concerning it
Those who study the Bible realize that two matters in the Bible are not easy to understand typology and prophecy
The book of Revelation, for example, is mainly a book of prophecy, but this book also contains quite an amount of typology
When some hear this they may wonder how this concept can be wrong since we today are endeavoring to build up the church
When we are about to do some building work by speaking for God, He may check with us, saying, 'Do you intend to build My house?
We need Christ not merely in name and in knowledge; we need the real Christ, Christ as the Spirit in resurrection
We may have much knowledge of the Bible and be able to teach the Bible to others, but this is not the way to build up the church
2 Samuel 7 is the unveiling of a prophecy through typology showing us there is no need for us to build something for God
We need God to build up Christ into our intrinsic constitution so that our entire being will be reconstituted with Christ
Our spirit, the central part of our being, is surrounded by our heart, which is composed mainly of our mind, emotion, and will
We should build the church with gold, silver, and precious stones, signifying respectively God, Christ, and the Spirit
When we build the church with the processed and consummated Triune God, it is not actually we who are building
The church is built with the Triune God: with the Father as the source, with the Son as the element, and with the Spirit as the essence
On the one hand, the gifted persons perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry so that the Body may build up itself in love
It is not adequate simply to present to others some knowledge concerning God's economy and other divine, spiritual, and heavenly things
If we are filled with the Triune God, when we speak He will flow out and be ministered to others for their nourishment
Samuel 7 is a prophecy predicting that the church will be built up by God Himself among His people in the New Testament
God intervened and did not permit David to do this, because David did not have an adequate and thorough view of God's economy
After stopping David from building Him a house, God went on to reveal something further concerning His economy
On the one hand, the New Testament reveals that the Godhead is unique and that only God, who alone has the Godhead, should be worshipped
David had the heart to build a house for God, but God indicated to David that this was neither what he needed nor what God needed
Even though he was a man whose heart was according to God, he did not have anything related to God organically
As a result, we are not simply a man according to God's heart we are God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead
We today are not outwardly as high as David was, but we can declare that we have God's life, nature, and constitution
In order to accomplish this, God in Christ became a man and went through some processes that this man could be designated something divine
On the one hand, the New Jerusalem is the dwelling place of God; on the other hand, it is also our eternal dwelling place
Ephesians 3:17 tells us that Christ is now within us doing the work of building Himself into us to produce this mutual abode
That will be the seed of David and the Son of God something divine and human satisfying God's need and our need for a mutual abode
As such a Minister, He is not in the flesh, for in resurrection He as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
We should look to Him, behold Him, and reflect Him, opening to Him the three layers of our being our spirit, our heart, and our mouth
We will spontaneously reflect Him as a mirror and gradually be transformed into His glorious image from glory to glory
Transformation is a metabolic process that changes us by adding some new element into our being and discharging the old element
A Christ who is only an objective, historical Savior, the One whose story is recorded in the Bible, would not be related to us organically
He passed through death and entered into resurrection, and through this process He became the life-giving Spirit
The issue of such a building is that we become a very particular class of people the members of the Body of Christ
In different kinds of meetings, we endeavor to minister Christ into the saints as their spiritual food and drink
Today there are many who do not believe that Christ in His resurrection and ascension still has a physical body
They believe that when Christ died He died in the body, but when He resurrected He put off the body and resurrected only as a divine person
Isaiah 11:1 says, 'There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots'
At Solomon's time the house of David was a flourishing tree, but a short time later that tree began to be cut down
In answering Jesus said, 'You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven'
Today Christ as the Son of Man is sitting on the throne in heaven, and He will come again also as the Son of Man
In heaven Jesus sitting, Christ the Lord is there enthroned; As the man by God exalted, With God's glory He is crowned
God in Him on earth was humbled, God with man was domiciled; Man in Him in heav'n exalted, Man with God is reconciled
He as God with man is mingled, God in man is testified; He as man with God is blended, Man in God is glorified
From the Glorified in heaven The inclusive Spirit came; All of Jesus' work and Person Doth this Spirit here proclaim
A man is now in heaven As the Lord of all enthroned; This is Jesus Christ our Savior, With God's glory ever crowned!
Christ is human and divine; He is the Creator and He is also a creature; He still has a physical body, yet He dwells in our spirit
We can experience Christ as the Spirit because He is within us and with us all the time, even until the consummation of the age
God's intention from eternity to eternity is to make Himself us, that we might become Him in life, in nature, and in constitution
God commanded Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, telling him that in the day that he ate thereof he would die
The conscience was activated, and fallen man thus feared God and worshipped Him, realizing that he should do good and abandon evil
What had been revealed was mainly that man needed God that man had been created by God and for God and that he needed to receive God as life
We see that God builds Himself into man to produce a house, and the issue of this building is a seed, which is Christ
We today may say that Christ is everything to us: our life, our breath, our food and drink, our clothing, and our abode
We need the Christ who is dwelling in our spirit to build Himself into our heart, making our heart, with our humanity, His home
The Bible begins with the tree of life, the flowing river, the precious materials of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone, and a builded wife
Although there is no time element with God nevertheless He has in the course of time gradually bit by bit released His revelation to man
God revealed to Job that what He wants is a man who has God, not a man of uprightness, integrity, and perfection
God revealed to Job that his unique need was God Himself, but He did not reveal to him anything concerning building
Isaac is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the One who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham
The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ
According to the common understanding and view among Christians, God gave Christ to be our Redeemer and our Savior
Christ's incarnation, Christ's human living, Christ's death and resurrection they all are for God's desire to work Himself in Christ into us
All the steps, big and small, that God takes in our daily life are to fulfill His intention of building Himself in Christ into our being
God reacted by saying to David through Nathan the prophet, 'Will it be you who builds Me a house to dwell in'?
God revealed to David something concerning building, a matter that had not been revealed to either Job or Abraham
The house of David, which was a flourishing tree at Solomon's time, eventually was reduced to a stump consisting mainly of Joseph and Mary
Christ in resurrection, Christ as the life-giving Spirit, has sown Himself into us not simply to stay in us but to grow in us
The Christ who has sown Himself into us is now doing a particular work in us the work of making His home in our inner being, in our hearts
Revelation 3:12 tells us that Christ will make the overcomer a pillar in the temple of God, which is the New Jerusalem
He builds the church not merely by saving sinners and making them believers and members of Himself but by building Himself into them
If we see this, we will realize that all our problems today are due to one thing our shortage of having God in Christ built into our being
We thank the Lord that, throughout the years, He has opened His Word to us and has been speaking to us in His recovery
In the recovery we must see the universal Body and do everything in the limitation, the regulation, of the one Body
He passed through death and entered into resurrection and ascension, becoming the consummated, life-giving Spirit ready to come into us
On the one hand this material is Christ Himself as the element on the other hand this material includes something from us with our humanity
The Triune God has come into us to do a building work with Himself as the element and also with something from us as the material
The word concerning building in these verses implies that God's building Himself in Christ into us has very much to do with what we are
If the seed were sown into sand or among stones, it would not grow, because neither sand nor stone can supply the necessary nutrients
If we remain in our soul, in our natural man, there will not be any nutrients for the growth of the divine seed
If we are strengthened into our inner man and if we pay attention to our spirit and exercise our spirit, the nutrients will be supplied
If Christ's making His home in our hearts did not need something from us, Paul would not have prayed for us as he did in Ephesians 3
On the one hand, God strengthens us with Himself as the element and, on the other hand, we afford the nutrients
Through these two God in Christ carries out His intrinsic building the building of His home in our entire being
The New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in and God and the Lamb as the temple are for the redeemed saints to dwell in
In 2 Samuel 7 God seemed to be saying, 'David, you are a man according to My heart, but you need Me to be wrought into your heart
We need to practice one thing to minister the processed Triune God into others so that He may build Himself into their inner man
In verse 12 God speaks of David's seed, and in verse 14a He says, 'I will be his Father, and he will be My son'
If we read the Bible without paying attention to this crucial point, then, in a very real sense, the Bible is to us an empty book
On one occasion when the Pharisees were gathered together, the Lord Jesus questioned them, saying, 'What do you think concerning the Christ?
The Lord Jesus was indicating that He, the son of David, was the Son of God the very matter revealed in 2 Samuel 7:12-14a
As the divine element is constituted into our humanity, we become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead
If our work is not related to this mutual constitution, then in the eyes of God our work is like wood, grass, and stubble
Chapters eight through ten are concerned with David's conquest over his enemies for the strengthening of his kingdom
David struck the Philistines and subdued them, taking control of the chief city out of the hand of the Philistines
Verse 15 says, 'So David reigned over all Israel, and David executed justice and righteousness for all his people'
At that time Joab was over the army; Jehoshaphat was recorder; Zadok and Ahimelech were priests; and Seraiah was scribe
David felt obliged to show kindness, for the sake of Jonathan, to any remaining descendant of the house of Saul
When Mephibosheth came to David David told him not to be afraid for he would surely show kindness to him for the sake of Jonathan his father
David went on to tell him that he would restore to him all the land of his father Saul and that he would eat food at his table continually
Mephibosheth paid homage to David and said, 'What is your servant that you should look upon a dead dog like me'?
David gave all that belonged to Saul and to all his house to Mephibosheth, making Ziba and his household servants to Mephibosheth
Hanun insulted the servants of David by shaving off half their beards and cutting away half their garments at the buttocks
Seeing that they had become odious to David, the children of Ammon hired soldiers of the Syrians and men of Maacah and Tob
David defeated all the Syrians, and all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer king of Syria made peace with Israel and served them
Verse 2a tells us that late one afternoon David rose from his bed and went for a walk on the roof of the king's house
Joab surely realized that he was involved in a conspiracy to carry out a great sin, and his conscience must have condemned him
Uriah was not merely devoured by the sword he was actually murdered by David so that he could take Uriah's wife
Even though he was a person of high attainment in his spiritual pursuit, he was still able to commit such a great sin
Even in the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1 there is a word regarding this: 'David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah'
When David heard about the rich man who took the poor man's ewe lamb, David's 'anger was greatly kindled against the man
Under God's punishment, there was fornication and killing in David's family, and David's son, Absalom, even rebelled against him
David confessed his sin against Jehovah, and Nathan said to him, 'Jehovah has also put away your sin; you will not die'
As we have pointed out in his record of Christs genealogy Matthew purposely wrote David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah
He has the full capacity to carry out what He wants according to the desire of His heart and according to His eternal economy
Boaz, an important ancestor in the genealogy of Christ, was a good pattern because he controlled the lust of his flesh
David, on the contrary, even though he was a man according to God's heart, had a great failure in the matter of the lust of the flesh
Solomon's kingship had a wonderful beginning, but the same thing happened with him as with his father, and his end was pitiful
Today, although they have a narrow strip of land near the Mediterranean Sea, they have no peace with their neighbors
As we consider this matter of God's judgment, we need to be very conscious of what God is and of what our response should be
With Christ as the life-giving Spirit, everything is real, but apart from Him everything is vanity of vanities
Eventually, the spirit of David the king longed to go out to Absalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead
Absalom asked David the king to let him go to Hebron to pay a vow which he had vowed to Jehovah, and the king told him to go in peace
Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel saying When you hear the sound of the trumpet you shall say Absalom is king in Hebron
David asked them to bring the ark back into the city of Jerusalem and to stay there to collect intelligence for him
David asked his friend Hushai to stay in the palace and to work together with the priests to defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for him
David answered Abishai, saying, 'If Jehovah has told him to curse David, who then can say, Why have you done so?
Ahithophel gave an evil counsel for Absalom to go in unto his father's concubines for the strengthening of all those who followed him
Hushai defeated the counsel of Ahithophel with the help of the priests and their sons, who told David how to escape from his son Absalom
That man said that he would not put his hand against the son of the king, for the king had commanded that they take care of Absalom
They took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest and cast up over him a very great mound of stones
Ahimaaz the son of Zadok the high priest wanted to announce the news to David, but Joab prohibited him and asked the Cushite to do it
When the Cushite came to David, he told the king that Jehovah had avenged him of all who had risen up against him
The people debated throughout all the tribes, and this debate resulted in the request for David to return to his kingship
David asked the high priests and the captain of the army to persuade the people of Judah to bring King David back to his place
Barzillai, a very great man, had provided food to David and escorted him in crossing over the Jordan on the way back to his palace
The claims of Israel and Judah show that the whole people warmly welcomed David in his returning to his kingship
Sheba a man of Belial a Benjaminite blew the trumpet and said We have no portion in DavidNor do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse
All the men of Israel left David and followed Sheba, but the men of Judah clung to their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem
The men of Joab went out after Abishai, along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men, to pursue after Sheba
Amasa came to meet Joab and his followers, and Joab struck Amasa in his stomach with a sword and poured out his bowels onto the ground
David found out that the reason for the famine was Saul's breaking of the oath made by Israel with the Gibeonites
For the settlement of the breaking of the oath, the Gibeonites required seven descendants of Saul to be executed
David commanded the people to fulfill the requirement of the Gibeonites, and God responded to the people's entreaty for the land
In fighting against the Philistines, David became faint, and was in danger of being killed by a giant of the Philistines
David praised God as his crag, fortress, Deliverer, rock, shield, horn of his salvation, high tower, refuge, and Savior
David concluded by saying that the wicked will be like thorns to be thrust away and will be burned with fire in their place
Abishai, the chief of the three and the most honored among the thirty, became their leader, but he did not attain to the first three
The altar was built on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite , and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
And 2 Samuel unveil to us, from the beginning, that God's accomplishment of His economy needs man's coordination and cooperation
