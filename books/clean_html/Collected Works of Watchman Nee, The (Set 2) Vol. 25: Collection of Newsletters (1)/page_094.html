<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Answering Letter</H2><P>Greetings to Brother Ta Ching:</P><P>I met with Brother Wang Yu T'ing for several days. We spoke about the importance of having a meeting for all the co-workers from various places. There should be one at least once a year. We are already praying. If the Lord is willing, we hope to meet in the fall when it is cool. (We plan to hold it in Ting Pu T'ou.) Therefore, Brother Wang cannot give you an answer concerning the conference in Feng Ch'uan at this time. May the Lord's will be done. Please pray much. Thank you for your greetings to us.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Wu Sheng</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM TAISHAN,<br>KWANGTUNG PROVINCE</H2><P>To the sisters in the Lord in Shanghai:</P><P>We wrote a letter to you when we left Swatow and told you something of the condition in Swatow. Now we will tell you something of the condition of Kung Ho City in Taishan.</P><P>We arrived in Kung Ho City on July 12. Kung Ho City is a country town in Tai Cheng County. Although it is only fifteen or sixteen miles from the city, everything is very rustic with the exception of a few new buildings in town.</P><P>We began the work on July 16. (We worked for five days every week.) The first half of the first week we only preached the gospel. The second half of the week, half of the work we did was for sinners and half for new believers. Some were clearly saved, but the number was not large. There were four or five who said they believed, but I dared not say with assurance that they were saved. The second week was entirely for believers. Thank God, most of the sisters received a little help.</P><P>Although it was very hot the first week, there were usually about one hundred people in the meetings. During the second week, there were two meetings a day, and it rained every day. The weather was cool, like the beginning of fall. There were between forty to fifty people in the meetings every day. God really graced us. If the weather had been too hot and the attendance too mixed, it would not have been so easy to get through.</P><P>These last two days I have been doing a little individual work with the sinners who are on the borderline. After meeting and talking with them one by one, I know their situation, and it is easier to pray for them. There are seven or eight like this. Please pray for them also that they may be saved soon.</P><P>The Lord really used Sisters Lei and Lin. Over the past few years they have already gained more than forty sisters. These two sisters were originally going to give us hospitality, but then all the sisters wanted to have a part. They also manifested their diligence in other matters besides hospitality. Their offerings in love covered all our lack. Although they live in the country, they are the same as the sisters in Swatow in this matter.</P><P>Even the few sisters in the Presbyterian Church who come every day to hear the message have manifested their love in the Lord in their treatment of me.</P><P>I say this, not in the way of praising them for being good to me. I have really seen the Lord's work in them. Sometimes I am afraid it is difficult for them, but the responsible sisters said that they are usually like this in their treatment of others because the love of the Lord constrains them. I also hope that the sisters in Shanghai will treat all the sisters from other localities who pass through Shanghai and all the working sisters in the same way. I always thank my God. The love of all the sisters always causes me to weep. I can only ask the Lord to reward you and them richly!</P><P>There are quite a few sisters here with a good ability to understand. However, the gifts of Sister Lei and Sister Lin are in the preaching of the gospel. They teach during the week, and this presents some difficulties in the matter of edification. This matter requires your prayer. I told the two sisters that children are born, but there is no one to take care of them. They hope a sister who is a little deeper in spiritual life can come for a longer time to cultivate the sisters for a while.</P><P>Every day I have a time with the two sisters to pray together and to talk about the matters of the work. I confess that the only thing that can be of any help to others is for us to first learn the lesson before God and pass through the experience. Otherwise, it is hard to escape being idealistic, and there will not be any assurance in the work.</P><P>Tomorrow (August 1), I will leave Kung Ho City for Kung Yi Pu (more than ten miles from here). I will stay there for four or five days and work with a small number of the sisters. On August 8, I will go to Kwangchow. On August 11, I will go to Hong Kong. I will hold meetings in Hong Kong for five or six days beginning on August 13. Then perhaps I will go to Amoy for five or six days. I do not know yet if I will go to Hsing Hua. I still must receive a letter from the co-working sisters and see what the feeling in the Body is before deciding.</P><P>I have slept pretty well this trip. Every time I leave a place, God always has His special arrangement with regard to time. Please give thanks with me to God for all these matters.</P><P>I pray for you often. If there is a special need, I pray for it almost every day. You have already prayed for me, please continue to pray to God so that He will bless all the seeds that have been sown and that they will grow. May God bless you in all things!</P><P>Your sister,<br>Ruth Lee</P><P>P.S. There is a sister here who is a young widow. She sells soybean sprouts for a living. She has to support her mother-in-law and a young daughter. Her father-in-law is abroad and does not remember her financially. God has blessed her. When others cannot sell their bean sprouts, she is always able to finish selling hers. When she sells them, she testifies for the Lord. She can read. However, she must get up in the middle of the night and is very exhausted. When the country people see that her business is good, they often try to cheat her. She is very kind and has considerable compassion for others, so she often lends and gives money to people. However, because the people think that she is gullible, they try to cheat her even more. Her face shows the suffering of her labor. She wants to change jobs to be a temporary laborer (either in a hospital or a school). Please ask God to open a way for her. One day she gave me twenty cents. I consider that her money is as the water of Bethlehem (2 Sam. 23:16-17). I could not bear to drink it; I could only offer it for the printing costs of The Glad Tidings. I explained this to her, and she had peace.</P><P>Sister Lei Mei Hsiung is too tired; she must rest for at least a few months. Please pray for her also.</P><P>Ruth Lee</P>
