This throne is for the kingdom. Out of the throne proceeds the water of life, and in the water of life grows the tree of life with fruit to feed and leaves to heal. This is a matter of the kingdom. The kingdom is altogether a matter of life. In Genesis 1 and 2, the image of God and the dominion of God required the life of God. In Revelation 22, life proceeds out of the throne of God to produce the kingdom, which expresses God and represents Him. Look at the New Jerusalem. God's image and dominion can be seen there. Revelation 21 and 22 are the fulfillment of God's intention shown in Genesis 1 and 2. The kingdom is a totality of life, and life comes out of the throne to produce the kingdom. The essential matter is this&#151;the kingdom is altogether a matter of life. Without life there is no kingdom. If there is life, there will surely be the kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHILDREN, LIGHT, AND SALT</H2><P>We are the children of God because we have the life of God. To God we are children. To the earth we are the salt (Matt. 5:13). To the world, we are the light (Matt. 5:14). Salt kills germs and removes all the corruption. Light swallows up darkness. As God's kingdom and God's children, we are the salt which kills the corruption of the earth and we are the light which swallows up the darkness of the world. This is the function of the kingdom of God. As salt, we will eventually heal the earth. The tree of life produces leaves and these leaves heal the nations (Rev. 22:2). This is salting. We are the salt to the earth, and we are the light which swallows up all the darkness. Wherever the kingdom of God goes today, corruption will be killed and darkness will be swallowed up. However, this is a corporate, not an individual matter. Together, we are salt, and we are light.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Kingdom &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
