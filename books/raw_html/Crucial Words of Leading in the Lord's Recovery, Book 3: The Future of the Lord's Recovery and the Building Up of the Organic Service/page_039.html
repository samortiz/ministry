	 <h2 class="head1">NOT GIVING OURSELVES TO THE LORD<br />
BUT DENYING OURSELVES</h2>
<p>The chorus of <em>Hymns,</em> #456 says, &ldquo;O Jesus, Lord and Savior, / I give myself to Thee, / For Thou, in Thy atonement, / Didst give Thyself for me.&rdquo; There is also a problem with the chorus. It is difficult to find a verse in the Bible that says the Lord wants us to give ourselves to Him. On the contrary, the Lord wants us to deny ourselves. Not only does the Lord not want our self; He even tells us that we should not want our self. Why would we give the Lord something that He does not want? Why would we give the Lord something He wants us to give up? Even though this hymn is very poetic, the truth contained in the poetry is not very high.</p>
<p>We should never think that discerning the truth is an easy matter. In Matthew 16:21 the Lord Jesus said that He must go to Jerusalem to be killed and on the third day be raised. When Peter heard this, he took the Lord aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, &ldquo;God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; (v. 22). If we had been there, we would have shouted Amen and thought that Peter was right. But the Lord answered, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan!&rdquo; (v. 23). Then He continued, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself&rdquo; (v. 24). Hence, the Bible clearly tells us to deny ourselves; it does not want us to give ourselves to the Lord.</p>
<p>Perhaps some would say that Romans 6:13 says, &ldquo;Neither present your members as weapons of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your members as weapons of righteousness to God.&rdquo; They think that this verse speaks of presenting ourselves to God, but if we consider the context of this verse, we will see that <em>yourselves</em> does not refer merely to us as those who have been raised from the dead; it refers also to our members. Our members are part of our body. Romans 6 deals with the problem of sins. Sinning is mainly a matter of the body. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves.&rdquo; This chapter refers to our bodies being put to death by the cross. Hence, <em>yourselves</em> in Romans 6 refers to our bodies. The Scripture is clear about this to the extent that it mentions not only &ldquo;body&rdquo; but also &ldquo;members.&rdquo; This means that <em>yourselves</em> in this chapter does not refer to the soul, the self.</p>
<p><em>Myself</em> in the chorus of <em>Hymns,</em> #456 refers mainly to the person in our soul, not to our body. Strictly speaking, we cannot give ourselves to the Lord; we must instead put ourselves aside. This is what Paul says in Galatians 2:20: &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; The I, the self, in this hymn does not refer to the body but to the person, which is our natural I, the soul-life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LETTING CHRIST LIVE IN US</h2>
<p>If we do not have a basic knowledge of the truth when we read this hymn, we will gain a wrong understanding. The hymn says that we must give ourselves to live for Christ. To live for Christ is an erroneous concept. It is not that we live for Christ; it is that we let Christ live in us. Then, in our bodies we need to cooperate with the Lord and allow Him to direct us. According to what is written in Romans 6, when we present our bodies to be under His direction, we are offering our members to God (v. 13).</p>
<p>If we do not have the light of the truth when we sing this hymn, we will offer ourselves to God and think that we can do something great for Him. One of the problems in Christianity is that before believers give themselves to God, they do not have many difficulties. But as soon as they consecrate themselves to God, they have problems that result in divisions and produce many sects. Therefore, we must remember that we must not bring our &ldquo;self&rdquo; with us when we love the Lord. We should never think that after we have consecrated ourselves, we must live for Jesus from then on, nor should we want to accomplish something for Him. If we do this, we will fall into trouble, and after ten years the full-time serving ones would be divided into five or six different groups.</p>
<p>We should not consider living for Christ; instead, we must realize that we have already been crucified with Christ, that we have died, and that it is Christ who lives in us. We should not be persons who live for Christ; rather, we should be persons to whom to live is Christ. &ldquo;Because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:14). If we have died, how can we still live? We must remember that we have all died. However, every way that we take in resurrection is a living way with a tremendous future because Christ is living in us. In ourselves, we are at a dead end. However, because Christ is living in us, we are full of hope and have a bright future.</p>
<p>If the young people have the slightest misconception concerning <em>Hymns,</em> #456, they will get into trouble. Anyone who is sixty-five years and over, however, will have a heart filled with so much gratitude that they will think it is sufficient just to have the opportunity to love the Lord, and they will be satisfied simply to serve Him in the church. The older ones do not really want to go out and do something great. Those who have been called by the Lord to serve Him full time for their entire lives have a wonderful testimony. Just as Judges 5:15 and 16 say, they have great resolutions in heart and great searchings of heart. But when we see some with such a lofty desire, there is also some concern because we fear that as &ldquo;wild oxen&rdquo; and &ldquo;wild asses&rdquo; they will desire to live for Jesus and want to accomplish something great. We fear that they will destroy the church. I say this because of lessons we have learned in the past.</p>
