   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A DOUBLE PERSONALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A double personality means that there are two personalities or two masters within a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is different from the new man and the old man that we usually speak of.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a person who is seriously possessed by demons, we can clearly see the characteristic of a "double personality."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a person is possessed to the uttermost, others will sense that another brain is controlling him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He will do things that are contrary to his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His body will seem to be taken over by an external force.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His nerves and muscles will stress, contract, and tremble involuntarily.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His mouth will speak words that he does not know or scarcely knows, and his voice will seem to belong to another person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can observe that the manifestation of demons comes and goes in many heathens who are demon-possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before the demons "come," the person is quiet and normal, but when the demons "come," he immediately changes from his normal posture and acts like a madman.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From this we can see one thing: when a man is possessed by demons, he has a double personality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In addition to his own person, there is another person within him who employs the various faculties of his soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When demons are manifested, they nearly take over everything; all the activities belong to them, and man's own personality is not active.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consequently, after the demons depart, many do not know what they did, spoke, or expressed when the demons were there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason for this is that the demons' personality was acting; man's own personality was not functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a result, man's personality does not know or is completely ignorant of what previously transpired.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the "manifestation" of demons is sometimes very refined.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Quite often, demons make a man speak and behave like a normal human being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, the demons' personality is operating; man's personality is left dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this kind of manifestation, we are often misled to think that this is man's work; we have difficulty realizing that it is the activity of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only when demons behave abnormally can we discover a double personality in a person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When believers are possessed by demons, there is also a double personality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since the degrees to which they are possessed differ, the manifestations of a double personality also differ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Evil spirits surprisingly control every part of the being of those who are seriously deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They make believers tremble and burn, and they give them all kinds of strange feelings, casting them down to the floor, causing them to speak in unknown tongues, and putting voices in their ears that others have never heard and visions in their eyes that others have never seen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time, these believers still can be very peaceful in their spirit and have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are not discerning and assume that since they can contact God these manifestations must be from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Little do they know that: 1 the Holy Spirit never takes over any part of man's body and uses it on His behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Paul saw the vision, he could still control himself and still speak on his own Acts 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Peter saw the vision, his mind was also clear, and he was able to control himself 10:9-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even when John saw the vision, he was able to control himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why he could write the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At first he fell on the ground because he could not withstand the Lord's light of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the Lord strengthened him, however, he rose up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He could remember what he had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is unlike many today who claim that they have been knocked down to the ground by the Holy Spirit without knowing what they were doing and what they experienced while they were down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>2 The believer has the Holy Spirit dwelling in his spirit, yet at the same time his body is possessed by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, he has the experience of a double personality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In his spirit he has fellowship with God, but evil spirits manifest their works in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The believer must not think that whatever he does in his outward body must be something from God just because he has fellowship with God in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He should realize that because he is regenerated, his new life will always have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One thing is certain: a life that is truly filled with the Holy Spirit will never have an experience of a double personality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A double personality indicates that a person is possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With those who are less deceived, a double personality is not as obvious as it is in the ones mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sometimes a believer may find that someone besides himself and outside of him is laying hold of his faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many thoughts that are not from him may come rolling in. His will may seem to be paralyzed, numb, and unable to decide, choose, or determine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His imagination and memory may seem to be locked up by someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He cannot remember or think about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His reasoning may seem to be somewhat cold and hard, and he may not know how to think logically.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many unexpected words, behaviors, and attitudes may proceed out of him without the consent of his will, which he finds unable to control.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a more hidden manifestation of a double personality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The meaning of a double personality is the existence of two independent, human, and personified entities.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It means that there is no need for the person to exercise his own will to decide anything, that his soul and body, in part or in whole, can move surprisingly on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It means that outside of man's will, there is still another will, which directly rules man's soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A demon-possessed believer is one who has the will of evil spirits in him in addition to his own.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A demon-possessed believer is one whose own will is suppressed and over whom the will of the evil spirits reign.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a double personality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When a believer has a double personality, there are two kinds of power in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes the Holy Spirit sends out His power from the believer's inner man, and sometimes evil spirits direct their power from the believer's outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sometimes the Holy Spirit expresses His grace, blessing, and light, and sometimes evil spirits also display their works from the believer, which are counterfeits of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They will cause him to see visions, laugh wildly, sing loudly, cry sorrowfully, or feel a kind of numb happiness surging through his body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today there are numerous workers who have this double personality!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But there are few who can discern the spirits!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Satan will use this kind of people to accomplish his work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because many of the things they do are spiritual and of God, believers are afraid to reject what Satan puts behind them later.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The believers will talk about what is of God among these things and say, "Are not these things very good?"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The believers forget that this is the mixed work of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Satan always does a work of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The principle of all his works is to sow tares among the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He does not preach lies only; he preaches truths also.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He uses the truths to trumpet his lies.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Furthermore, he is willing to preach truths more than lies so that his plots will not be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After he gains his ground, he will reverse the original proportion!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can see this mixture in many meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The believers must learn how to discern and prove all things; otherwise, they will be infected by workers with double personalities.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They will also fall into passivity and be possessed by demons.</S>
