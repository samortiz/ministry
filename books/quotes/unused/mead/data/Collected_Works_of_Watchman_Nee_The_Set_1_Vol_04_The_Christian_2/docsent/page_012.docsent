   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Why does the Lord allow them to go through the great tribulation and to suffer?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He wants to use the suffering to discipline them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord rebukes and chastens them because He wants them to "partake of His holiness" Heb 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If God does not receive His children's response when He calls them with love in grace, He will have no other course but to refine them with rebukes in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Unripe wheat cannot be gathered into the barn.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Likewise, immature saints cannot be raptured!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the love of the Lord cannot draw their spirits to the heavens, He will, for their benefit, use suffering to turn their spirits to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why so many saints will have to enter the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When they are ready, the Lord Himself will come to the air to receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time, 1 Thessalonians 4 and 1 Corinthians 15 will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, may the Lord grant us grace and make us willing now to allow His Holy Spirit to work the cross deeply into us through the constraint of Christ's love, so that we will have the genuine experience of being crucified, resurrected, and ascended with the Lord, and that we will gain His pleasure and be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After all the saints are raptured and right before the beginning of the millennial kingdom, the Lord will come with the clouds from the air to appear together with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here, we see the complete union of Christ and the Christians: having died together, resurrected together, ascended together, and appearing together.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory" Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This appearing is the coming to earth for the judgment of the Gentile nations that are still alive on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our study of prophecy we should carefully differentiate these three points: the special rapture of the overcoming saints, the coming of the Lord to the air to receive all of the saints, and the coming of the Lord with the saints to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The verse presented here is not a confession by the church of her expectation, but an announcement by the saints of the judgment on all men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is their testimony to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, this verse speaks about the Lord Jesus coming to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is in complete agreement with the scenes that follow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus will come "with the clouds."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This agrees with the words of the prophet Daniel, when he said he "watched in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven, One like a Son of Man was coming" 7:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is also the same as the testimony in Acts: the Lord Jesus "was lifted up, and a cloud took Him away from their sight...Behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them, who also said,...This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven" 1:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The same way He went up with the clouds, He shall come with the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This also agrees with what Jesus said to Caiaphas, "I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven" Matt 26:64 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Every eye will see Him."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How different this is compared with His ascension!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This will be the time for Him to receive authority and power.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether dead or alive, Gentiles or Jews, one day all shall see His face!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not the Lord's coming to receive His saints!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time no one can see Him except the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The coming again at this time is with form and body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, "every eye will see Him."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only so, "even those who pierced Him" will also see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The one who pierced the Lord Jesus was a Roman soldier John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In reality, however, it was the Jews who pierced Him John 19:37; Zech 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, "even those who pierced Him," although referring to the Jews, includes not only the Jews but also the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word "every" in "every eye" denotes both the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"And all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the original text "the land" can refer to Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who shall wail are the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Zechariah records that the Israelites shall mourn after looking upon the pierced Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please read chapter twelve, verses 12-14.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There, only the tribe of Judah the houses of David and Nathan and the tribe of Levi Shimei, Num 3:18 are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Perhaps there will only be those two tribes in Jerusalem at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps they were singled out because those two tribes are the tribes of kings and priests.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, "the land" can also mean the whole earth and "all the tribes" can denote all races.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, here it not only speaks of the wailing of the Israelites, but of the wailing of all men.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The wailing in Zechariah denotes only the repentance of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The wailing here, in the case of the remnant of the Israelites, is for repentance, and in the case of all others, for disappointment and fear.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"And at that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the land will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory" Matt 24:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that time, the age of grace having completely passed away, God shall favor the Israelites according to His righteousness, and He shall also judge the nations according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather than wailing at that day, why not wail today!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sinners of the world, why not come to the cross of the Lord today to mourn for your sins?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Accept the Lord Jesus as your Savior, and ask God to forgive your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not wait for that day.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On that day, you, a Gentile, shall wail, but it will be too late!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Come now quickly!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now let me say some more concerning the Lord's coming again and the order of events here.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should read Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the end of the seven years all the nations shall gather together to fight against Jerusalem Zech 14:2 , at which time the Jews shall flee to the Mount of Olives v. 5 . The Lord Jesus shall come with His saints in the clouds and in the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord's feet shall stand upon the Mount of Olives v. 4 , fulfilling the prophecy spoken by the two men in white clothing Acts 1:11 . The mount will be split at its middle, and there shall be a very great valley.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Israelites shall flee to the valley of the mountains Zech 14:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Afterward, they shall look upon the Lord Jesus whom they pierced 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Someone will ask the Lord what these wounds in His hands are, and the Lord will answer, "Those with which I was wounded in the house of those who love me" 13:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then the Israelites shall know that Jesus whom they despised is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then they shall mourn and repent 12:10 and shall accept the salvation accomplished for them on the cross by the Lord Jesus 13:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the other hand, the Lord Jesus shall judge all the Gentile nations on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At that time, those who treated the Jews kindly in the tribulation will be sheep and shall become the citizens in the millennial kingdom and shall enter into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Those who ill-treated the Jews will be the goats and shall enter into eternal fire.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After these things, the millennial kingdom will begin.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Let us come back to the text.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"Yes, amen."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>According to the Greek text, the expression "yes" is only one word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The meaning of this one word is exactly the same as "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The only difference is that this one word is Greek, whereas "Amen" is Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Here the apostle had only one meaning in mind but used two different languages to repeat it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What is the reason?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What is recorded in this verse was the testimony of the saints to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The apostle ends the verse with these two words, indicating: 1 the church is looking forward to the coming of the Lord "wholeheartedly"; 2 the church testifies to the Gentiles Greeks; and 3 to the Jews Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>These two words are the response concerning the Lord's coming again by the saints who love the Lord's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the Epistles the apostles of the Lord expressed the coming again of the Lord Jesus as the blessed hope of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All those who truly love the Lord long for the appearing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Therefore, after testifying to the world that the Lord will come, the apostle spoke these two wholehearted expectations in order to express his earnest desire for the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Although the Lord's coming is to judge all men, to cause all men to wail and to suffer, the apostle said, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He would not delay the Lord's coming by his compassion toward all men.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There is nothing wrong with that because this is allowed by the Holy Spirit and is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, it is recorded here so that when we read it, we will also say, "Amen" once and twice.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We love all men because the Lord loves them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We should not love our work more than the appearing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Our hearts have to be attracted by the Lord to the extent that nothing stands between us and our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Indeed, we should love the souls of men and be faithful to our work.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should, however, rest in God because He also loves sinners much more than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He treasures His own work much more than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Since He considers that His Christ should come again, we should not question His wisdom, grace, and mercy one bit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>His thoughts are the best.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>At any rate, what we love should not just be men but should be God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>What we long for is not our work but rather the Lord who grants us work.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Are our hearts not joyful?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>May there be a deeper love and longing between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Here, two Amens were used in verses 6 and 7.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Just as a saint desires to see the Lord Jesus glorified and rejoices because He Himself shall have a beautiful future, in the same way he should love the Lord's second coming for the judgment of all those who do not obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The church has already testified to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Christ is coming soon.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The age of grace is drawing closer to an end day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>God's judgment in wrath is coming nearer day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Are there those who listen to this testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>No. On the contrary, many who love to mock begin to say according to their lusts: "Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue in this way from the beginning of creation!" 2 Pet 3:4 . Therefore, God shall come and testify.</S>
