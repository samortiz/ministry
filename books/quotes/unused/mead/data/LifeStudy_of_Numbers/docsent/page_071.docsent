   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>More Than All Men Who Were on the Face</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>of the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all men who were on the face of the earth" Num 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In God's lexicon, in the spiritual dictionary, to be meek is not to strive, not to fight back, when others are against you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, one of the nine blessings is given to the meek: "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth" Matt 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not those who fight or strive who will possess the earth; the meek will inherit the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second Timothy 2:24 says, "A slave of the Lord must not contend, but be gentle toward all."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moses was such a person; he did not fight or strive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Numbers 12:3 was written by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was not easy for Moses to write such a word about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows Moses' faithfulness v. 7; Heb 3:2, 5 . Whatever God told him to write, he wrote, even if it was something good about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If he had refused, he would have been unfaithful, and he would have been political.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He would have been playing politics.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In every area of human society, we can see the playing of politics.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is difficult to find the frank faithfulness of one who serves God according to what God says.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God Intervening</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Numbers 12:5-9 God intervened.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>of the Tent, Speaking to Aaron and Miriam</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Jehovah came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the entrance of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward" v. 5 . God took the slander of Miriam and Aaron seriously because this matter touched God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To touch, defy, or challenge God's authority is to shake God's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is very serious, much more serious than murmuring evil and lusting for meat.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Vindicating Moses</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God vindicated Moses as His servant, one who was faithful in all His house v. 7 . God also vindicated Moses as one with whom He spoke mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in obscure words, and as one who beheld the form of Jehovah v. 8a .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rebuking Aaron and Miriam</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God rebuked Aaron and Miriam.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He asked them, "Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?" v. 8b . The anger of Jehovah burned against them, and He departed from them v. 9 .</S>
