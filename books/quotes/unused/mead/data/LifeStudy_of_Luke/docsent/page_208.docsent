   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE SEVENTY THE MAN-SAVIOR S RESURRECTION 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 2:24; 3:15; Rom 4:25; Acts 10:41; John 10:15, 17-18; Heb 2:14; 1 Cor 15:52-54; John 13:31-32; 17:1; Luke 24:26; John 12:24</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing messages we have considered in detail two very important matters: the incarnation of the Man-Savior and the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now in this Life-study we want to cover two more vital matters the Man-Savior s resurrection and His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the Bible, three matters related to the Man-Savior are of particular importance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These matters are His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Along with the Lord s Person, these are clearly revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, they have not been covered adequately by most Christian teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Person of Christ is, of course, a great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This mystery is related to and involves the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that when we consider the Person of Christ, we cannot avoid the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ s all-inclusive redemptive work includes His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His redemptive work began with His incarnation and was completed in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All that Christ did during His thirty-three and a half years on the earth was part of His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I believe that in this Life-study we have covered Christ s incarnation rather thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Life-study messages on both Mark and Luke we have spoken much regarding Christ s human living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, we were brought to the end of Christ s redemptive work with the three vital and crucial matters of His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE MAN-SAVIOR S SEVENFOLD STATUS IN HIS DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have seen that when the Man-Savior died on the cross, He had a sevenfold status.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that He died as the Lamb of God John 1:29 , a man in the flesh, a man in the old creation, the serpent John 3:14 , the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 , the Peacemaker Eph 2:15 , and a grain of wheat John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A simple way to remember the aspects of the Man-Savior s sevenfold status in His death is to recall the three aspects mentioned in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First we are told that Christ was the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world; second, that He was typified by the brass serpent; and third, that He was the grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lamb of God took away our sin, the One typified by the brass serpent destroyed the old serpent, Satan, and the grain of wheat released the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hallelujah, sin has been taken away, Satan has been destroyed, and the divine life has been released!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Having seen these aspects from the Gospel of John, we may go on to consider the remaining four aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ died on the cross as the Firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this aspect of His status, He brought the entire old creation with Him to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ also died as a man, the last Adam, bringing the old man to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, He was crucified as a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second Corinthians 5:21 says that He was made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin is related to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, Romans 8:3 says that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the cross He condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Finally, Christ died as the Peacemaker, the One who abolished the ordinances of human culture and living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, on the cross Christ was the Lamb, the serpent, the grain of wheat, a man in the flesh made sin for us, the last Adam, that is, a man in the old creation, the Firstborn of creation, and the Peacemaker.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this sevenfold status He died as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as we have considered the Man-Savior s sevenfold status in His death, we also need to see a number of points concerning His resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is difficult to find a book that speaks of the Lord s sevenfold status in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, it is also difficult to find a writing that covers all the various matters we shall see regarding the Lord s resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many of these matters are neglected in today s teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, in the Lord s recovery we have the burden to cover them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nothing that we share in these messages is the product of our imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the contrary, every point comes from the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All that we have seen concerning Christ s death, resurrection, and ascension comes from diligent study of the Word under the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we consider the Man-Savior s resurrection, we need to humble ourselves and empty ourselves of preoccupying thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, we need to realize that Christ s resurrection has nothing to do with the things of Easter, such as colored eggs.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Regarding the Lord s resurrection, there are two main aspects: the objective aspect and the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With both the objective and subjective aspects there are a number of points.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this message and the message following we shall cover the objective aspect of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we shall go on to consider the subjective aspect, the aspect of the Lord s resurrection that involves something that needs to be wrought into our being.</S>
