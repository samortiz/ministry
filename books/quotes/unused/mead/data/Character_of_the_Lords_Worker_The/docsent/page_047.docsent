   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us give an example to show the meaning of being accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to Matthew 22, the Sadducees did not believe in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One day they came to the Lord and posed a question, saying, "Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies and does not have children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now there were seven brothers with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And the first married and died, and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother; likewise also the second and the third until the seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And last of all the woman died.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For they all had her" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>24-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Resurrection was unthinkable to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They thought that it would be better if there was no such thing as resurrection, because it would complicate things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They preferred to believe that there was no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They came and reasoned with the Lord, coming up with a seemingly unsolvable problem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus answered, "You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>29-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Sadducees certainly read the Scriptures, but the Lord said they did not know the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They spoke so carelessly that it was impossible for them to appreciate the absolute accuracy of God's utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our Lord only quoted a short passage from Exodus 3 to prove resurrection God calls Himself the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How does this short word prove resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord went on to explain, "He is not the God of the dead, but of the living."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To the Sadducees Abraham was dead, Isaac was dead, and Jacob was dead; all three were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Would this not make the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob the God of the dead?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet God is not the God of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since God is not the God of the dead, Abraham must not remain dead forever.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The same must be true of Isaac and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But how can dead men no longer be dead?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They must be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will all be resurrected because God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus answered the Sadducees this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our Lord was very accurate in the things He said.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It exposed the inaccuracies of the Sadducees and their ignorance of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are careless in our speaking, we will not appreciate how accurate God's word is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A sloppy character does not care for accuracy and is incapable of accuracy; it is not capable of holding and containing God's accurate word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible is the most accurate book; it is accurate to the last iota and serif.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord said, "One iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law" Matt 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is purposeful in every iota and serif; He is never loose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since God is so accurate in His words, His servants should also be accurate in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, God is never ambiguous in His speaking; He is never careless.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His words are always firmly established; every one of them is sure and unshakable.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we read His Word, the more we will realize that not a single word can be added or deleted.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must pay attention to this point: no one who is loose in his speaking can be a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A loose talker will have no impact among the brothers and will not even be able to handle God's word himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some brothers are a suffering to others when they speak from the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One only has to listen to a message from such ones and he will realize how sloppy these ones are.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A sloppy person can only speak sloppy words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even when God's word is before him, he will speak in a sloppy way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If he is sloppy when he walks off the platform, how can he be anything but sloppy when he stands on the platform?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No sloppy person can read the Bible, and no sloppy speakers can speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May God be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>May we receive mercy to have an accurate mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should offer up a prayer to the Lord: "Give me the tongue of a learner so that I will not be loose, careless, or flawed in words.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not want to lose many things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I do not want to lose my testimony."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are careless in speaking, we cannot read and understand God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In studying the Bible, we have to dig out the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But a sloppy person cannot find any facts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to learn to speak carefully and cautiously before we can appreciate the accuracy of God's every word.</S>
