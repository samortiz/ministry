   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN SECOND CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 2:13; 4:13, 16; 6:6; 7:1, 13; 12:18</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we want to see the revelation concerning the human spirit in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second Corinthians covers not only the Holy Spirit of God but also the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul covers the human spirit not in the way of doctrinal teaching but in the way of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He did not teach doctrinally about the human spirit, but from his writing we can see that he was a person always living, acting, and walking in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second Corinthians may be considered as an autobiography of the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this autobiography we see that he always acted in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Corinthians speaks about the human spirit, but the second Epistle speaks about the human spirit in a deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE REST IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2 Corinthians 2:12-13 Paul said, "Furthermore, when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was open to me in the Lord, I had no rest in my spirit, for I did not find Titus my brother; but taking leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we were composing this portion, we might say, "When I came to Los Angeles to visit some of my worldly friends, and the door of the gospel was shut to me by the Lord, I had no rest in my spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But Paul did not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said that he came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and that the door was opened to him by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But he did not have the rest in his spirit, so he went away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since the Lord opened the door, why did Paul leave?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Are we going to follow what the Lord has done, or are we going to follow what we feel in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seems that since a door was open to Paul in the Lord, this must have been the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some were taught that although the door was opened to Paul of the Lord, he gave in to his own personal weakness, because his brother Titus was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may think that Paul was too selfish and that he just cared for his feeling and not for the Lord's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now let us consider whether Paul's leaving was right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to realize that the apostle Paul was absolutely right because he was very subjective, not objective.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not care for the outward situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What he cared for was the inward feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now I would like to ask, "Was the Lord more intimate with Paul in the open door or in Paul's spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The door was opened by the Lord, but the Lord was more intimate to Paul in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we all have to learn a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This lesson is that we should not care too much about the outward circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even if there is a door opened by the Lord to us, if we just care for this and not for the Lord Himself in our spirit, we are not very intimate with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can illustrate this by a parent's relationship with his or her child.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes the parent would tell the child that it is all right for him to do something, but the child may sense that he will lose the intimacy of his parent if he does that certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In our service to the Lord, He may open a door for us to go on, yet we may feel deep within that we have no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do we want the open door or the rest in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I can testify that a number of times the Lord opened the door widely to me, but I did not have the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I could not go through the door; I had to go along with the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The inner rest is the green light, not the open door.</S>
