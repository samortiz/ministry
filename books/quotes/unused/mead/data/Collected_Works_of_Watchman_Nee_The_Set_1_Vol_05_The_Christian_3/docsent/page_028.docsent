   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"For I have found none of your works completed before My God."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is one pair of eyes constantly searching His churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What the Lord is rebuking here is not what they have done but what they have not done.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not what the Lord has seen but what the Lord has not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord told them to establish that which is about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This proves that they were saved already because no dead person can strengthen one who is about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the church in Sardis were dead, how could God accept their work, the work of a dead person?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the Lord is only rebuking the believers in Sardis for what they have not done, it proves that their works were not dead works Heb 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From man's point of view, their works were living and were outstanding, but in God's view, they were not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the standard of the believers' work is based on man's praise, approval, or disapproval, how low is this standard?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to man's view, the standard of the believers' work is diligence, zeal, labor, and advancement, but God's view is completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the One who judges us is God rather than the world, what does it matter if the world loves or hates us!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If our work is like that of Sardis, being incomplete in motive, power, self-denial, diligence, and purity, what use is it even if the world considers us living?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, even if the whole world considers our work dead, useless, and worthless, as long as we are complete before God, His smile will be a sun that dispels all dark clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All those who are satisfied with the world's praise are performing dead works before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our hearts should stay far away from the world's approval or disapproval.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They should be concerned with God's valuation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The good pleasure of the Father is our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What does it matter what the world says?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the eyes of the world, Protestantism succeeded in the work of the Reformation and is great and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even Protestantism itself considers its achievements great beyond comparison!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, what God cares for is not how it has rejected Jezebel and her teaching, but how it treats the authority and power of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is right to leave Rome, but why does one not fully listen to Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a joke and not a moral achievement to boast that one is not like Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If Jezebel is the yardstick of the believers' work, and if one thinks that as long as he is different from Jezebel he can boast of himself, then the children of Jezebel can also justify themselves Rev 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although today the denominations have not overstepped as much as the Roman Catholic Church has, God's question now is, "Is My Son the Head of the church?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"I have found none of your works completed before My God."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the excuse of Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By this one word, we see the Protestant denominations tolerating sin on the one hand and not fully following the Bible on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They think that it is impossible to be "complete."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, they give up seeking to be "complete."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To them, a church or an individual can never be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why then should one bother to be free from all sins and to follow all the Scriptures?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because of this excuse, many sins that God condemns are settling in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is actually the life of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is a lowering of the standard of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, God never says that a church does not need to be complete just because He has not found its works completed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He cares for completion, and He judges His children according to this completion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is willing to grant grace to the defeated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, He hates those who lower His standard and sit in contentment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We would rather lift God's standard high and find ourselves unable to match it, than to lower His standard and presume that we have succeeded in it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Reformation was a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sardis is the condition after a great revival.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If there is a revival, yet no willingness to submit to God's will and to yield to Him the proper place, the revival will not continue.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No matter how much grace we have received at one time, if we are not careful, what we have will become the letter and will gradually be weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Self-contentment is the cause of lack.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Unwatchfulness is the reason for weakening.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nothing will satisfy the Lord except completion, and nothing will satisfy the lovers of the Lord except completion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many times we have a good beginning, but we do not have a continuation in bearing spiritual responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a result we fall short of completion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the danger of the church and of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All those who do not advance to completion will regress to weakness.</S>
