   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 7 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rom 1:14-15 I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish; so, for my part, I am ready to announce the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The God-ordained Way Carried Out by Vital Groups</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We saw that the God-ordained way revealed in the Scriptures is of four steps: begetting, nourishing, perfecting, and prophesying .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To take the God-ordained way is by these four steps, but how do we carry them out?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The way to carry out these four steps is by the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>205 The vital groups should be composed of people who are overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>206 This is the reason that the groups are called the "vital groups."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>207 With all the four steps of the God-ordained way mentioned above, we need to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we need to consider how we can be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, we must have a time to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we will be enlightened by Him to see all our defects, mistakes, wrongdoings, shortcomings, trespasses, and transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should make a thorough confession to the Lord to have a thorough forgiveness and a thorough clearance of all these negative things before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we should ask the Lord to give us a companion with whom we can labor in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not say that we do not have the time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everybody is busy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to redeem and budget our time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should reserve two hours every week for contacting sinners by many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>208 We may contact people by personal visiting, by telephone, and by written correspondence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are many ways to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>209 Then we can get some saved and baptized to be our spiritual babes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to feed them, perfect them, and build them up to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must pay the price to take the biblical way, the God-ordained way in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>210</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paying Off Our Debt of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the members of the vital groups, we need to pay off our debt of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul said in Romans 1 that he was a debtor to those who had not heard the gospel from him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>211</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thousands of people in our localities were chosen and predestinated by our Father God, but without any prayer, without any concern by God's children for His chosen ones, He will not save anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He cannot save anyone until we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In principle, all of us have been saved through someone's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I was saved through my sister's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not need to pray long prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord desires to hear our genuine prayer, without our explanations and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should cry to the Lord in a simple and direct way for the salvation of all our relatives, one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the way to clear up our debt of the gospel with our relatives, our first circle of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our neighbors should be considered as our second circle, and our classmates and colleagues as our third circle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord told His disciples that they would be His witnesses in Jerusalem the inner circle , in Judea the second circle , in Samaria the third circle , and to the uttermost parts of the earth Acts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>212</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Preparing a Record Book</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to pray for people in a proper way, you should keep a record book.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You have to ask God specifically for a few names.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A few names will spontaneously come to your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You will have a feeling for them, and you will want them to be saved first.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A record book should have the following columns: The first column should be a number; the second column, the date; and the third column, the name.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will remind us of the number we have assigned to a person and the date we began to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fourth column should also be a date the date when the person is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One should persist and not give up once a name is in the book.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not certain when a person will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some are saved in a year, and some in two to three months.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Perhaps one or two of them may prove to be very difficult, but in the end they will still be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>213</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
