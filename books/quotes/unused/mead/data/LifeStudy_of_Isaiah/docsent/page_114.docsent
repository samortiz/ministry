   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH 3 AS TYPIFIED BY CYRUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO RELEASE JEHOVAH'S CAPTIVES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE BELOVED ISRAEL FROM BABYLON Scripture Reading: Isa 46 48; John 6:38; Matt 3:17; Isa 45:3-4</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will consider chapters forty-six through forty-eight.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In these chapters Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is typified by Cyrus to release Jehovah's captives of the beloved Israel from Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. THE IDOLS OF BABYLON</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>BEING POWERLESS AND USELESS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to 46:1-2 and 5-7, the idols of Babylon are powerless and useless and cannot be compared to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, the idols are a burden for Israel to carry in their coming captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning this, 46:1 and 2 say, "Bel has bowed down; Nebo stoops;/Their idols are on beasts and cattle;/The things which you carry are a burden,/A load for a weary beast./They stoop and have bowed down together; / They are not able to escape the burden; / But they themselves have gone into captivity."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Bel was one of the gods of the Babylonians, supposed by some to be the Babylonian name of Baal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead of helping the people of Israel, the idols were a burden to them, for the people had to carry them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Israel was captured by the Babylonians, God's people still would not give up their idols and had to carry them from the good land to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In these verses, Isaiah, speaking somewhat in a mocking way, seemed to be saying, "You people of Israel have made idols for yourselves, but they will not do anything for you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day you will be captured, and you will have to carry your idols with you as a burden into captivity."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anything that replaces God or occupies the position of God is an idol as a burden to the worshipper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today's human society encourages people to make idols.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A person, education, or a high position with a company can all become idols to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, every idol will not help us but instead will become a burden that we must carry.</S>
