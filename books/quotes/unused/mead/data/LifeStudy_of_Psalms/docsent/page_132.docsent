   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Urging God to Deliver Him</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by Instructing God according to</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His Natural Knowledge of Good and Evil</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verses 17-28 David urged God to deliver him by instructing God according to his natural knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>IN ASKING GOD TO DEAL WITH THE WICKED</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Psalm 35 David asked God to deal with his enemies, and in Psalm 36 he asked God to deal with the wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. His Accusation of the Wicked</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verses 1-4 are his accusation of the wicked: "Transgression speaks to the wicked/Within his heart;/There is no dread of God/Before his eyes./For he flatters himself in his own eyes,/Until his iniquity is found out and hated./The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit;/He has ceased being wise and doing good./He plans iniquity on his bed;/He sets himself on a path that is not good;/He does not reject evil."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here David did not have the heart or the intention to ask God to be merciful to the wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, he accused them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. His Praising of God's Lovingkindness, Faithfulness, and Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mixed with the Enjoyment of God in His House</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verses 5-10 are his praising of God's lovingkindness, faithfulness, and righteousness mixed with the enjoyment of God in His house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verses 7-9 are a top portion of the Psalms concerning the enjoyment of God in His house, but such a portion is in a psalm in which David asked God to deal with the wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This again shows us the mixed expressions of David's sentiment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>C. Entreating God to Deal with the Wicked according to His Way</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verses 11-12 say, "Do not let the foot of the arrogant come upon me,/Nor let the hand of the wicked drive me away./There those who do iniquity are fallen;/They are cast down and unable to rise."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In these verses David entreated God to deal with the wicked not according to God's way but according to his way.</S>
