   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>READING THE BIBLE Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:15-17; Psa 119:9-11, 15, 105, 140, 148 I. THE IMPORTANCE OF READING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every Christian should read the Bible because it is "God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It shows us many things that God has done for us and the way He has led men in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we want to know the riches and vastness of God's provision for us, we must read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we want to see God's step-by-step guidance for men, we must read the Bible as well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's speaking to man today is based upon what He has already spoken in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God rarely speaks things which He has not already spoken in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though a person may be quite advanced in his spiritual walk, God's revelation to him will still be confined to the words that He has spoken in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, God's speaking today is merely a repetition of His own word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a person does not know what God has spoken in the past, it is difficult for him to receive His revelation in the present because he lacks the basis for God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, if God wants to speak something to others through us, He will also do it on the basis of what He has spoken in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not know what God has said in the past, He cannot speak through us to others, and we are useless in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why we need to let the word of God dwell in us richly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By letting His word dwell in us richly, we know His past ways and hear His present speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only then can God use us to speak to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible is a great book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a monumental work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even if we spent our whole life on the Bible, we could only touch a part of its riches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is impossible for a person to understand the Bible without spending time to study it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every young Christian should do his best to labor on God's Word so that when he grows old, he can nourish himself and supply others with the riches of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everyone who wants to know God must study His Word in a serious way, and every believer should realize the importance of reading God's Word from the very beginning of his Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BASIC PRINCIPLES IN READING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are four basic principles in reading the Bible: 1 Discover the facts, 2 memorize and recite the words, 3 analyze, categorize, and make comparisons, and 4 receive God's enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must follow the sequence of these four steps when we read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot jump from the third to the first step or from the first to the third step.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, discover the facts in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, memorize these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must know and memorize God's Word accurately and exactly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot afford to leave out or ignore any portion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do, our reading will profit little.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Third, analyze, categorize, and make comparisons with the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After we have analyzed the facts accurately, categorized them properly, and compared them clearly before God, we will have the ground to take on the fourth point God's enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible contains many facts that are spiritual in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a man's inner eyes are blind, he cannot see these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But once he discovers these biblical facts, half of the light contained in the Word will be his.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's enlightening is just His shining upon the facts that are recorded in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Discovering the facts is half of our job in reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we read the Bible, the first thing we have to do is discover these facts.</S>
