<h2 class="head1">OUR NEEDS ENABLING US<br />
TO EXPERIENCE THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is rich, His riches are unsearchable, and He is everything to us. If we need Him, we will draw out His riches. A person who does not realize his need for Christ will not be able to enjoy the riches of Christ. When there is a sense of need, the riches of Christ will be drawn out. Careless, lazy, and indifferent Christians are not able to enjoy the riches of Christ. Christians who are serious with the Lord and who desire to overcome, to be holy, and to be acceptable to God are not loose. Such Christians know that they have no way and no power and, hence, develop a sense of their need for Christ. It is difficult for Christians to experience Christ as their victory, holiness, and way if they do not pursue victory or holiness and do not serve. Some Christians regard the meeting hall as a place for them to be entertained. They want others to sing to them, to preach to them, and to serve them. Such Christians want only to watch and listen. They do not sense their need for Christ; hence, they do not experience the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>A Christian who receives burdens realizes how much he needs Christ. If none of the believers in a local church rise up to minister or to lead, some should be concerned about this situation and receive a burden from God. These ones are not proud, nor do they want to be leaders. Rather, they know that the church cannot go on without the grace of the Lord. A brother who receives such a burden might initially feel that he does not know how to speak or what to say. However, the burden within him will force him to go before the Lord to experience and enjoy the riches of Christ. If he continues in this way, he will not merely give messages, but he will minister the Christ whom he has experienced. His experiences will enable him to speak, because his words are Christ.</p>
<p>In the same principle, a brother may see that the church needs some to rise up to bear the responsibility and pay the price to administrate matters related to the children of God. This brother might not know how to serve, but the burden within forces him to experience and enjoy Christ until Christ becomes his administration and service. We must remember that the church is not a society that needs natural capabilities and talents. The church needs only Christ. The messages that the church needs are Christ, the administration that the church needs is Christ, and the service that the church needs is also Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR SERVICE NEEDING TO MINISTER<br />
THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of service that have two different results. One kind of service is natural, and the other kind of service is of life. A capable person tends to do things by his natural ability. Such a person usually does things well, but it is easy for him to be proud. Because he serves by his natural ability, he cannot tolerate criticism; he reacts when others touch a lack in his service. This kind of service does not lead others to touch life.</p>
<p>The second kind of service is of life. A brother may not have a natural talent, but he loves the Lord. When this brother sees that no one in the church is serving, he prays and is willing to receive the burden to serve. This can be compared to the case in Matthew 14 of the Lord feeding the five thousand with five loaves and two fish. The disciples told the Lord to send the crowds away into the villages to buy food for themselves, but the Lord told the disciples to give the crowds something to eat (vv. 15-16). A brother who does not have natural eloquence or ability may receive the burden to pray, &ldquo;Lord, the church needs people to serve. Raise up such ones.&rdquo; Then the Lord might tell him to rise up and receive the burden to serve. The brother might say, &ldquo;I do not know how to serve,&rdquo; and the Lord might answer, &ldquo;I am your way.&rdquo; This need of the church forces the brother to go before the Lord, to enjoy His riches, and to serve by the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Initially, this brother may be confused in his service, but he should humble himself before the Lord and continue enjoying the riches of Christ. As a result, when his service is criticized, he will ask the Lord and the saints for forgiveness and will continue endeavoring to minister life. Eventually, even if his messages seem awkward and he is inexperienced in managing matters, his service will always lead others to touch the Lord&rsquo;s life. This is the way that the church should take today.</p>
<p>The church needs people who can minister life more than just manage things. Human society looks for people to manage things in a clever and effective way, as if they were running a business. But this is not the need in the church. The church should minister the riches of Christ. We need to see that there is only Christ in the church. The service needed in the church is to enjoy and minister the riches of Christ. Then the church can become the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>A brother and I have been together for nearly twenty years. When he was appointed as an elder, he was not good at giving messages or administrating, but he could minister Christ to people. Because he enjoyed and experienced the riches of Christ, the saints always sensed that the presence of Christ was with him. Furthermore, because he loved the Lord and the church and was willing to receive the burden of administrating, he prayed for many matters in the church and often fellowshipped with the Lord. As a result, he experienced the Lord in administrating the church. His messages were not impressive or powerful, but they were filled with Christ, and those who listened to him were supplied. Hence, our needs compel us to experience and enjoy the riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR ENVIRONMENT AND SUFFERINGS<br />
ENABLING US TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST</h2>
<p>The environment that God arranges for us and the sufferings that He measures out to us also enable us to experience and enjoy the riches of Christ. Our environment and sufferings help us to experience more of Christ. It is not easy for a person who is always prosperous to experience Christ. There is a difference between the riches of Christ that we experience in sickness and the riches that we experience in health. There is a difference between the riches of Christ that we experience in poverty and the riches that we experience in wealth. There is a difference between the riches of Christ that we experience in failures, oppositions, and attacks and the riches that we experience with success and popularity. God often raises up different environments and allows us to experience suffering so that we would experience Christ. Therefore, it is unlikely for a genuine seeker of the Lord to always live a life of ease. However, we should not fear the circumstances that the Lord arranges, because He will also look after us and guide us. He arranges our environment to meet our specific need so that we would experience Christ.</p>
<p>We must learn to worship the Lord, for His deeds are wonderful and perfect. The Lord arranges a precious wife for a brother and a precious husband for a sister, and His arrangement is never wrong. A brother needs the dealings that come from his wife, and a sister needs the dealings that come from her husband. A good brother may love the Lord but have a strong natural disposition that cannot be touched or changed by anyone. Therefore, the Lord arranges for his wife to deal with him. After a few years of married life this brother becomes pliable, open to suggestions, and no longer insists on his own opinions, because the Lord measured to him a precious wife. The Lord also arranges the children for parents and parents for the children, and His arrangement is never wrong. All parents experience both sweetness and bitterness in raising their children. Parents always feel helpless with regard to their children and feel that others&rsquo; children are better behaved and more obedient than their own. The same applies to children. Children always feel that other parents are more loving than their own parents. We need to believe that what the Lord measures to us is never wrong. Our spouse was chosen by God before the foundation of the world. Our parents and children were also prepared by God. Even the brothers and sisters who coordinate and serve with us in the church were arranged by the Lord before the foundation of the world. There are often conflicts among the brothers and sisters who are placed together to serve and coordinate. Such conflicts force them to experience and enjoy the riches of Christ. Our environment and sufferings are arranged by the Lord for us to experience Christ so that we may minister life to people.</p>
<p>Ephesians shows that the riches of Christ are unsearchable. We need the entire Bible to explain these riches, and we need our whole life to experience them. May the Lord burden us and may He enable us to sense our need so that we may experience His riches in our environment and sufferings. Only by enjoying the riches of Christ can we become the fullness of Christ, which is the Body of Christ. This is the church that He is after.</p>
