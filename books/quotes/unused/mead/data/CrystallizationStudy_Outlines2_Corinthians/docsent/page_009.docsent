   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul was jealous over the saints with the jealousy of God 11:2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As ambassadors of Christ, the new covenant ministers carry out the ministry of reconciliation 2 Cor 5:18-20; 6:1: The apostles were authorized by Christ to represent Him to do the work of reconciliation 5:18, 20.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The ministry of reconciliation is not only to bring sinners back to God but also to bring believers absolutely into God and to make them absolutely one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Two steps are required for men to be fully reconciled to God: The first step is to reconcile sinners to God from sin v. 19: For this purpose Christ died for our sins that we might be forgiven 1 Cor 15:3.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ bore our sins on the cross that they might be judged by God 1 Pet 2:24.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>14-15.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The two steps of reconciliation are portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle Exo 26:37, 31-35; Heb 9:3; Matt 27:51; Heb 10:19.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are to carry out the ministry of reconciliation, we need to be identified with the crucified Christ 2 Cor 5:14; Gal 2:20a; 5:24; 2 Cor 4:10-12.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Corinthians still lived in the flesh, that is, in the soul, the outer man, the natural being 1 Cor 3:1; 2:14: The veil of the flesh, the natural man, separated them from God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul was working to cut asunder the separating veil of the flesh so that the believers at Corinth could enter into the Holy of Holies Heb 10:19-20.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only when we have been fully reconciled to God are we fully saved 2 Cor 6:1-2; Rom 5:10; Heb 7:25.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The extent to which we can bring others to God and into God is always measured by where we are with respect to God; the more we are in Him, the more we can reconcile others into Him 2 Cor 12:12a; 5:20.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The ministry of reconciliation brings us back to God to such an extent that we become the righteousness of God in Christ v. 21: Not only are we justified by God Gal 2:16 we actually become the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Christ died on the cross as our Substitute, God considered Him not only the sin bearer but sin itself; now in resurrection Christ comes into us as life, and this life lives within us to constitute us into the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In substitution Christ was made sin for us; now in His constitution we become the righteousness of God in Him 2 Cor 5:21: The phrase in Him means in union with Christ, not only positionally but also organically in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Christ died on the cross, God condemned Him in the flesh as sin for us Rom 8:3; John 3:14 so that we might be one with Him in His resurrection to be God s righteousness; therefore, in the organic union with Christ we are made the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To become the righteousness of God in Christ is a matter of being right with God in our being; this is to have an inner being that is transparent and crystal clear an inner being in the mind and will of God 2 Cor 5:21.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be fully reconciled to God will cause us to be enlarged in our hearts; how large our heart is depends on the degree of our reconciliation to God v. 20; 6:11-13.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through the ministry of reconciliation, we are incorporated into the processed and consummated Triune God to become, in Christ, an enlarged, universal, divine-human incorporation; as a result, we become God s sanctuary, His dwelling place, His Holy of Holies the New Jerusalem John 14:20, 23; Rev 21:2, 10, 16.</S>
