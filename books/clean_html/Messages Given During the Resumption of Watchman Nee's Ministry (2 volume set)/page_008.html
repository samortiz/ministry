He is created for a specific use. A light bulb can only shine when it is placed in the proper place. If it is not placed in the proper place, it will not shine; if the bulb could speak, it would tell you that it was senseless that it should be there. In the same way, unless a man exists for a specific purpose, that man is empty. Man's specific use is to be filled with God, in the same way that the light bulb is used to shine forth light. In this universe, man should be filled with God and should shine for God. Some people are filled with money, education, family, and position. But after they are filled with these things, they are still empty. Lands and houses are but turmoils and headaches. Man does not live for these things. The specific purpose of man's living is God. Whether a person is young or old, rich or poor, male or female, as soon as a person touches God, he is satisfied.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S PURPOSE IN MAN&#151;<br>FOR MAN TO CONTAIN HIM AND TO EXPRESS HIM</H2><P>Within every one of us, we need God. Without God, we feel empty, unsatisfied, and sad. God needs us also. He needs us more than we need Him. God not only created man; He also sought man out. After Adam fell, God asked him, "Where are you?" When the Lord came, He came to seek and to save the lost sinners. In the story of the prodigal son, we see God's need for man. The father needed the son. Parents need their children more than the children need their parents. Why did God create man, love him, and save him? Some say that God is love, and that He has prepared many places in heaven. They say that if we do not go to heaven, heaven will be empty: "All things are ready; come to the feast"&#151;this is the calling of God's love. But what is the purpose of God's loving us and saving us? God's purpose is to receive glory through man. His purpose is to express His life through us. When a light bulb is connected to the electric current, it shines forth light. This is the meaning of glory. When God enters you and is expressed through you, it is glory. God desires that we be filled with Him within. Every saved believer has God within him. We need to see this before the Lord, and we need to present ourselves to God in this way to be His vessel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONSECRATION NOT FOR GOD'S WORK,<br>BUT TO BE GOD'S VESSEL</H2><P>Many times we want to do this and that kind of work for God. I have been to a number of places in northern and central China, and I have seen some very zealous workers for the Lord. Although they are very zealous, few among them know that they are God's vessels. To them, there is not much difference between being God's vessel and working for God. But I have to say that there is a big difference between being zealous for God and being God's vessel. To those among you who have consecrated yourselves to the Lord, I would like to ask a question: "Why did you consecrate yourselves to the Lord?" God wants us to be His vessels so that He can put Himself inside of us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S WAY&#151;<br>CALLING MAN TO BE HIS VESSELS</H2><P>It is natural for us to work much for God and to save souls. There are over one million people in Hong Kong. If there are ten or twenty brothers and sisters here who are filled with God within, in two to three years, you will definitely see many people saved. But more than that, those who will be saved will be very different from those who are saved today. As long as God fills Hong Kong, blessings will be here. I arrived here on Tuesday (December 23). By now I have been here three to four days already. I have met many brothers and sisters who are very zealous. I would like to ask if among these many brothers and sisters there are some who are God's vessels. Here is an elderly sister. She has been meeting with us from the very beginning. Let me ask, "What are you doing here? Are you here merely to meet, to listen to messages, and to pray?" If that is what you are doing here, God cannot have a way here; He will not be able to spread out from here. This is why in the past there have been so many revival meetings, spiritual conferences, and other meetings, and yet after these meetings are over, no one has changed. In the nineteenth century, there were many conventions, sermons, conferences, and revivals. But these things are not God's way today. Only when some answer God's call will God have a way today. There are those who are zealous for God. There are also those who work for God. But how many are there who will truly answer God's call?</P>
