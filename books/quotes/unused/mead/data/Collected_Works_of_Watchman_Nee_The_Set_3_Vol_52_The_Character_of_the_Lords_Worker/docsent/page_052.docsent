   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brothers and sisters, we should not have the concept that we should neglect our body.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is true that we need a mind to suffer and that we need to reign over our body and put it under subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we also should take care of our health if at all possible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is easy to be loose, and it is hard to exercise care.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to learn to eat healthy foods and to take care of our bodies in every possible way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Lord has a commission and there is a need in the work, we have to sacrifice ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is nothing we can say about this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But at the same time, we have to employ every means available to us to take care of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to remember that the loss of one person is the loss of ten to twenty years of the Lord's training.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are not many periods of ten to twenty years in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people start out somewhat useful and gifted in their service to the Lord, yet it is hard to say that they will have any usefulness in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It takes at least ten to twenty years before a person can become useful in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A person often has to wait ten or twenty years before he can become valuable and useful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Being truly useful is something that happens ten or twenty years later, and we are talking only about those people who are running a straight course.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the course is not straight, even ten or twenty years may not yield any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not a simple thing to raise up a person in twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has to smite him and do a carving work on him many times before he can pass the test.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He has to go through sufferings year after year, not just a few years, but twenty years, bearing the cross for twenty years, being dealt with for twenty years, being smitten for twenty years, and suffering under God's heavy hand for twenty years, before he can start to be useful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How difficult a task this is!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet if a man does not take good care of his body, he may be gone by the time he is beginning to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That would be very unfortunate and a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once an elderly brother was asked, "What do you think was the most productive period of your life?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He thought for a while and then answered, "Between seventy and eighty years old."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Indeed, spiritual usefulness grows with years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The longer we remain in the way of God's service, the more useful we become.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have seen many people who have been ruined, wrecked, damaged, or proven to be of little use along this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have seen some whose function blossomed only a little.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A few will prove to be useful after twenty or thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But by then they may be ready to depart from the world!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a pity when a man dies just at the point when he is beginning to become useful!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more lessons a man learns before the Lord, the more useful he is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a great loss for such ones to pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In taking care of our health, there are many necessary precautions we have to take, many necessary things we have to pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We agree that we need a mind to suffer, and that such a mind is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many times when we are put in a difficult situation, we have to be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But, if at all possible, we should learn to take care of our bodies and should not be loose or careless about our own health.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Workers of the Lord should not eat for taste, but for nutrition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should eat foods that have a high nutritional value and should eat less or nothing at all of those that have little nutritional value.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When it is time for rest, we should learn to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have enough strain upon us already.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not know how to rest, our bodies will not be relieved of its tension.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If our stress cannot be relieved when we lay on our bed, what is the use of our sleep?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many times our sitting down should be a kind of resting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But many people are not restful when they sit down, because they continue to be stressful and tense.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A worker of the Lord should be strong enough to bear strain when circumstances make it necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At times strain can be as intense as fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But when we find some time for respite, we should rest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is impossible for anyone to be tense all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to learn to relax.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brothers and sisters, when we are free, we have to learn to relax our muscles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While we are sleeping, all of our limbs should be relaxed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should be able to stretch our capacity when there is the need for it, and when we do, we should be able to handle more stress than the strongest men.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our body has to obey us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But we cannot be under stress all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our muscles and nerves often need relaxation and rest; we have to find opportunity to allow our body to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is one way the body balances itself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we do not find time to rest, we will push ourselves beyond the limit and go to an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are not men of extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to trust in the Lord regarding our body, yet at the same time we have to follow natural laws and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a very basic lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to learn to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we learn to let go, we will find it easier to rest and sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Experienced ones have told us that counting the number of times one breathes can help a person to go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we are asleep, our breathing is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It may not be that easy to control our sleep, but it is easy to control our breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We can count the number of times we breathe, and we should not breathe quickly, but slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can learn to adjust our breathing to the sleeping mode.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our mind should be set not on sleeping but on breathing, on counting the number of breaths.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>First, we control our breathing to the speed we would breathe in our sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After a while, we will go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many people are able to go to sleep with this method.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In our sleep we breathe slowly and deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>By controlling our breathing, making it slow and deep, we can induce sleep for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We often need to count only up to a few hundred and then we are asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have to believe that the body God has created for us is good enough to go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to trust in God, and we also have to trust in God's law in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God has created a head for us that will go to sleep, and we should be able to go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should try to relax our whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This will give us rest.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we are not able to rest, we will be constantly under tension, day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Such a condition will not sustain us to accomplish many things.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We may be sick; we may be bound by more than one illness, but if we take care of our body a little more, we will save ourselves from many worries.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The same can be said about our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should not overeat, and we should not be too restricted in the variety of food we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should learn to eat all kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Some brothers and sisters cannot eat this and that and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There are not too many things that they can eat; this is not a healthy habit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have to learn to eat a wide variety of food.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Many things can provide nourishment to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we will only eat a few things, we are not doing our body any good.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We may not feel that we are short in nutrition now, but when we become thirty or forty years old, our lack of certain nutrients will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Our health will be damaged, and our life will be shortened.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Our life is governed by the things we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is why we have to learn to eat a wide variety of food.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Another advantage for having a wide variety in our diet is that we are not inconvenienced in any way when we are sent out in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Those who cannot accommodate a wide variety of food will not be able to tolerate many things when they are in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>They cannot eat things that are too cold or too hot.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They will encounter much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It is a different story if we are sick; we have to take care of our health.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But under ordinary circumstances, we have to learn to eat as many different kinds of food as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The Lord Jesus said, "Eat what is set before you" Luke 10:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is a good guiding principle.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Once a believer asked another believer on a ship, "Why did the Lord Jesus give loaves and fishes to the multitude?"</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The other replied, "The riches of the sea plus the riches of the land."</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is a very good answer.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>God's children should learn to take all the riches of the sea and all the riches of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The range of food we eat should be wide; the variety should be great.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Brothers and sisters, do not think that this is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If we do not control and discipline ourselves in this matter, our body will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We have to make our body our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>At the beginning we may find this difficult; we may find some food unpalatable to our taste.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But we have to discipline ourselves by forcing ourselves to eat those things.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>On the one hand, we have to have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>On the other hand, we have to learn to take care of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We have to be able to suffer hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When hardship comes our way, we have to be ready to sacrifice our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Some brothers are afraid of hardship; they cannot take this and that and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Such ones are useless in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Similarly, we have no sympathy for those brothers who do not exercise care for their own body.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Brothers and sisters, it is harder to be health conscious than to not be health conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Do not think that it is easy to talk about health.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>In order to take care of our body, we have to learn to control ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>A person must exercise self-control before he can be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We have to learn to eat things that are beneficial to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Our eating cannot be dictated by our taste; it should be dictated by what our body needs.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We have to learn to take good care of our body and to use it properly.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We cannot allow our body to break down easily.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>The Lord has spent many years working on us; we cannot deal with our body lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We have to take care of all precautions against disease.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If at all possible, and if the Lord so arranges, we should do our best to fulfill the requirements of good health and to eat things that are beneficial to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>We should not expose our body to risks unnecessarily.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Timothy was advised to take some wine, because that was beneficial to his health.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Do not drink anything that is harmful to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Always take things that are beneficial to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>This is a matter of principle.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>On the one hand, we have to deny self-love and be faithful unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>On the other hand, when we do not have a specific charge from the Lord, we should take good care of our own body.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>When we go to a place to work, we should try our best to take care of our hygiene.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>But we should not burden the local brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>When the environment is not up to the proper standard of hygiene, we have to learn to trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>But when circumstances allow, we should try our best to take care of hygiene.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>This will spare our body of much unnecessary damage.</S>
