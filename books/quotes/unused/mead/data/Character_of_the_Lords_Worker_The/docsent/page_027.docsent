   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Another demand of the body is comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We dare not find fault with a worker for enjoying a measure of ease in his living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But when his work calls for his sacrifice, his body should not ignore the call of the work if the comforts he was accustomed to are not provided.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If our body will not respond to our call, we cannot work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some brothers and sisters move around often, not because of the Lord's command, but because they are unhappy and uncomfortable with where they live.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can say that comfort has become their way of life; comfort is leading them by the nose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such ones cannot be of much use in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's servants should learn to thank Him for easy conditions when the discipline of the Spirit so orders them and when the Lord makes provisions for them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when the Lord's provisions turn the other way, and they are stripped of ease and comfort, they should be the master of their body and continue with their work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are not for a life of extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Under ordinary circumstances, we may enjoy better conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when the Lord's need calls for it, we should be able to bear what others normally cannot bear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some brothers and sisters can only live a comfortable life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As soon as their standard of living is slightly lowered, they are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such ones are of little use to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In running the race, we have to make our body our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must be able to live under any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Making our body our slave means that we will not be affected by our circumstances when the work calls for our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It means that we can carry on our work even when we have to live at a substandard level.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are unable to do this, we will retreat as soon as our conditions fall below our accustomed standard.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This does not mean that those whose lot is inferior will better withstand harsher environments.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many poorer brothers collapse physically as soon as they are given a lot that is inferior to what they are used to.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They love themselves too much, and they have never made their body their slave.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Another example is our clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While we should eat well and clothe ourselves, we should not give undue attention to the matter of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John the Baptist was a person with little concern for his attire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus said of him that if anyone wanted to see an elegantly attired person there was no need to look in his direction; the place to look was the royal palace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unfortunately, some Christians have set too high a standard in the matter of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They cannot go on without maintaining such a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We hold that it does not glorify the Lord for us to wear ragged garments; they are not a glory to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should, whenever possible, be clean, tidy, and suitably dressed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, when a need arises, we should be like Paul, who, even though he was in hunger and thirst and nakedness, continued to serve the Lord 1 Cor 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God's servants will exercise themselves at ordinary times, their body will be under their control, and their work in the Lord will not be affected by an issue such as their clothing.</S>
