<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: According to the rich and deep contents of this book, none other than the apostle Paul was qualified to be its writer. The mention of Timothy in 13:23 and the tone of fellowship also indicate that Paul was the writer. (For the reason why the writer was not clearly mentioned, see 1:1 footnote 2.) This book may have been written around A.D. 67 after the apostle Paul&rsquo;s release from his first imprisonment in Rome, while he remained in Miletus (2 Tim. 4:20). The mention of &ldquo;those from Italy&rdquo; (13:24) proves that this book was not written in Rome. According to the content, it was clearly written to the Hebrew believers.</p>
<p>B. The subject: Christ is superior to Judaism and everything it encompasses. His completed new covenant is likewise superior to the old.</p>
<p>C. The background: [The Hebrews to whom this book was written believed in the Lord, but they still wanted to hold on to their Jewish religion.] [In A.D. 63 Ananias, one of the high priests in the Jewish religion in Jerusalem, rose up with the Sadducees and Pharisees to persecute the Hebrews. At that time those dear Hebrews appreciated the Lord Jesus, but they were unwilling to forsake their old religion. Eventually, the Lord sovereignly raised up a circumstance which forced them out of it. If they were unwilling to go out, they would be forced out.] [Those Hebrew Christians truly suffered under that persecution. The Jewish religionists robbed them of their property and even threatened their lives (10:34). The Hebrew believers were troubled.] [The Hebrew brothers were bothered and began to wander. They could not say that what Peter and Paul preached and talked was wrong; neither could they say that the temple, the sanctuary, was wrong. They were in a dilemma, finding it difficult to decide whether to go on or to retreat. It was at this juncture that the book of Hebrews was written to them.]</p>
<p>D. The central thought: [In Hebrews is the present Christ who is now in the heavens as our Minister (8:2) and our High Priest (4:14-15; 7:26), ministering to us the heavenly life, grace, authority, and power, and sustaining us to live a heavenly life on earth. He is the Christ now, the Christ today, and the Christ on the throne who is our daily salvation and moment by moment supply. This is the Christ revealed in Hebrews.]</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: [This book, from 1:3, points us continually to the Christ seated in heaven. Paul, in all his other epistles, presents to us mainly the Christ who dwells in our spirit (Rom. 8:10; 2 Tim. 4:22) as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45 ASV) to be our life and our everything. But in this book, he points us particularly to the Christ seated in heaven with so many aspects to care for us in every way. In Paul&rsquo;s other epistles, the indwelling Christ is versus our flesh, self, and natural man. In this book, the heavenly Christ is contrasted with the earthly religion and all earthly things. To experience the indwelling Christ we need to turn to our spirit and contact Him. To enjoy the heavenly Christ we need to look away from all things on earth unto Him who is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. He has accomplished everything that is needed for both God and us by His death and resurrection. Now in His ascension He is sitting in the heavens, in the Person of the Son of God (1:5) and the Son of Man (2:6), in the Person of God (1:8) and man (2:6), as the appointed Heir of all things (1:2), the Anointed One of God (1:9), the Captain of our salvation (2:10), the Sanctifier (2:11), the instant Helper and constant Succor (2:18), the Apostle from God (3:1), the High Priest (2:17; 4:14; 7:26), the Minister in the true tabernacle (8:2) with a more excellent ministry (8:6), the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant (7:22; 8:6; 12:24), the Executor of the new testament (9:16-17), the Forerunner (6:20), the Author and Perfecter of faith (12:2), and the great Shepherd of the sheep (13:20). If we would look unto Him as such a wonderful and all-inclusive One, He, ministering heaven, life, and strength to us, will transfuse and infuse us with all that He is to enable us to run the heavenly race and to live the heavenly life on earth, carrying us through all the lifelong pathway and leading and bringing us into glory (2:10).]</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) introduction&mdash;God speaking in the Son (1:1-3), 2) the superiority of Christ (1:4&mdash;10:39), 3) faith&mdash;the unique way (11:1&mdash;12:29), 4) virtues for the church life (13:1-19), and 5) conclusion (13:20-25).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>[There is an urgent need today for the completion of the word of God. Although Paul was used in the completion of the divine revelation centuries ago, there is still the need for its completion in a practical way among Christians today. In most Christian groups there is very little ministry of Christ as life. Furthermore, not many dare to face the issue of the church. Through his subtlety, Satan, the enemy of God, is seeking to nullify the completion of the word of God. The enemy may allow Christians to preach what is revealed in the Old Testament, in the Gospels, and in the Acts. But he cannot tolerate the teaching concerning Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit or concerning the church as the mystery of Christ. Anyone who ministers along this line will be attacked by the enemy.] We are not afraid of the enemy&rsquo;s attack because we love the Lord and His completed word. We should give ourselves to study the word that we may be full of the truth. Then we may complete the age and bring the Lord back.</p>
