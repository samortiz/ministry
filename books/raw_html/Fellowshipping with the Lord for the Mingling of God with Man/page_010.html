        <h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP ENABLING US TO HAVE<br />
THE DIVINE LIFE AND NATURE</h2>
<p>The Bible says that God is Spirit (John 4:24), and it also refers to the Spirit as God (Acts 5:3-4). The Bible also says that God is life (John 5:26; 11:25; 14:6). God, Spirit, and life are one. Spirit is God&rsquo;s nature, and life is His content. Therefore, it is equally correct to say that God is in us, that the Spirit is in us, and that God&rsquo;s life is in us. To say that God is in us refers to Him as a person. To say that the Spirit is in us means that He is spiritual, not physical. To say that God&rsquo;s life is in us means that the content of the Godhead is in us. Our fellowship is in God, in the Spirit, and in life. Fellowship is the means by which we are mingled with God and become one flow with Him. Fellowship makes us spiritual, and through fellowship we are constituted with the content of God. Through fellowship we are mingled with God, and we gain His nature and His life.</p>
<p>Fellowship is the mutual flow of God and man, in which God and man are mingled as one. This can be compared to adding sugar to water to produce sugar-water. It is erroneous to say that only the water remains when the sugar disappears. Rather, the water is in the sugar, and the sugar is in the water. Likewise, in the mingling of God with man, man is not annulled. Rather, God is mingled with man, and man is mingled with God. The two, God and man, become one.</p>
<p>God is mingled with man through His being the Spirit as well as life. God mingles His nature, which is Spirit, with every part of our being. He also mingles His content, which is life, with every part of our being. Prior to His being mingled with our mind, emotion, and will, we did not possess His nature or His content. Through fellowship He mingles His nature and His life with our mind, emotion, and will. Then the nature of our thoughts becomes spiritual, and their content will be life; the nature of our emotions will be spiritual, and their content will be life; and the nature of our decisions will be spiritual, and their content will be life. Others will sense the flavor of God in our mind, emotion, and will because we are mingled with His spiritual nature and His content of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING INDEPENDENT</h2>
<p>We learn to fellowship by being dependent on God. We do not allow our mind, emotion, or will to be independent of our spirit. When we are not independent from God, we will not be independent from the spirit, and we will not use our mind, emotion, or will apart from our spirit. The thoughts of our mind will be subject to the ruling and supervision of our spirit. Our spirit will examine the feelings of our emotions and the decisions of our will. To exercise in this way is to learn to fellowship with God. Our fellowship with God is broken whenever our mind, emotion, or will is independent from our spirit. Sin is not the only thing that interrupts our fellowship with God. As soon as our mind, emotion, or will is independent from God, we lose the divine fellowship.</p>
<p>The lesson of fellowship involves bringing the activities of our whole being under the constant ruling of our spirit. We should not engage in an activity before it is examined by our spirit. Otherwise, even the best activities, such as giving a message or praying, can cause us to lose the fellowship of the divine life. Anything that is not examined by our spirit is independent of our spirit. The activities that disrupt our fellowship with God also cause our spiritual life to suffer loss. When we learn the lesson of fellowship, our spirit will become strong, healthy, living, and fresh. Furthermore, the Spirit will have the opportunity to spread into our mind, emotion, and will. When our mind is brought under the ruling and examination of our spirit, our spirit becomes strong, and the Spirit will have the opportunity to mingle with our mind. As a result, our mind will have God&rsquo;s spiritual nature and His life. Similarly, if we bring our emotion and will under the ruling of our spirit, our spirit will be strengthened, and the Spirit will spread into our emotion and will so that they become spiritual.</p>
<p>Initially, as we learn to fellowship, we need to bring our mind, emotion, and will under the ruling of our spirit all the time. After a period of time, our inner being will spontaneously turn to our spirit and remain under the ruling of our spirit. At that time, we will not wait until we are about to do something to be under the direction of our spirit; rather, our spirit will rule our mind, emotion, and will, telling them what to do. In the initial stage, we often will act first and be examined by our spirit later. At a later stage, our spirit will take the initiative to direct our mind, emotion, and will. Initially, we must turn to our spirit and inquire of our spirit. Later, we will remain in our spirit, and our spirit will direct us. At this time, our entire being is under the control of our spirit, and our spirit becomes our person. Our spirit will be enthroned in our being and will have the first place; we will be directed by our spirit. Then it will be easy to fellowship and to release our spirit. As a result, the life of God will flow out in our daily living.</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
