BUILDING THE HOUSE OF GOD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECTIONS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Central Vision of the Bible&mdash;Building the House of God&rdquo; can be considered the highlight of the Bible and also the essence extracted from the whole Bible. The content of the Bible is wonderful. The first two chapters are one section, the last two chapters are a section, and the chapters from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 are another large section.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Genesis 3 through Revelation 20</h2>
<p>Let us consider the section from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20. In the beginning of Genesis 3 there is a serpent. This serpent seduced man and injected sin into man; consequently, death was brought in. From this point forward, the serpent, sin, and death continue until Revelation 20. However, during this period God has His work of grace. God sent His Son Jesus Christ to deal with the serpent and work righteousness into man so that, through faith in the Son of God, man can be justified by God and thereby have life and live (Rom. 1:17).</p>
<p>In this large section of the Bible the serpent, sin, and death form a background that is in contrast to Christ the Son of God and to the righteousness and life He brings. In other words, we can say that this major section of the Bible speaks of the serpent, sin, and death in contrast to Christ the Son of God, righteousness, and life. The Son of God is versus the serpent, for the Son of God was manifested that He might destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8). The Son of God brought in righteousness to deal with sin, which was brought in by the serpent. Moreover, the righteousness brought in by the Son of God gives man life, and this life deals with death, which was brought in by sin (Rom. 5:21, 12). Hence, on one hand, the serpent, sin, and death are present, but on the other hand, there are Christ the Son of God, righteousness, and life.</p>
<p>The first three items are in opposition to the second three items, and all the stories in the Bible develop from these. Every event in the Bible includes these factors. In Genesis 3 the serpent, sin, and death came in. Then God said that the seed of a woman would bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head (v. 15). In addition, God prepared coats of skin for the sinners, Adam and Eve (v. 21), to cover the shame of their nakedness. The coats of skin typify Christ as the Lamb of God with the righteousness of God to deal with sin. After hearing God&rsquo;s word, Adam named his wife Eve, which means living, &ldquo;because she was the mother of all living&rdquo; (v. 20). This indicates that life came. Although the serpent brought in death, God&rsquo;s salvation brought in life.</p>
<p>Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 speaks, on the negative side, concerning the serpent, sin, and death and, on the positive side, reveals Christ the Son of God, righteousness, and life. When Christ came in the New Testament, righteousness and life also came (Jer. 23:6; 1 Cor. 1:30; John 1:4). At the end of Revelation Christ will judge the serpent, sin, those who followed the serpent and are defiled by sin, and death. In chapter 20 the serpent will be bound and cast into the abyss for a thousand years (vv. 1-3), and then he will be cast into the lake of fire (v. 10). All those who are defiled by sin will be judged and cast into the lake of fire as well (vv. 12-13, 15; 21:8). Finally, even death and Hades will be cast into the lake of fire (20:14). This large section of the Scriptures from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 is a story of two sides: of the serpent bringing in sin and death and of Christ dealing with the serpent, righteousness dealing with sin, and life swallowing up death. The three negative items of Satan, sin, and death are resolved in Revelation 20, the end of this section.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The First Two Chapters of Genesis and<br />
the Last Two Chapters of Revelation</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Similarities</h2>
<p>The first two chapters of Genesis form a section, and the last two chapters of Revelation also form a section. The content of these two sections marvelously reflect each other. First, both sections contain the tree of life. The tree of life is first spoken of in Genesis 2:9 and is not explicitly mentioned until Revelation. In Genesis 3 the way to the tree of life is closed (vv. 22-24). After these verses the tree of life seems to disappear, but it is spoken of again in the last two chapters of the Bible. Hence, the first and last sections of the Bible reflect each other, having the tree of life as their focus. Second, both sections contain a river. There is a river in Genesis 2:10 and also in Revelation 22:1. Third, both sections contain three kinds of materials&mdash;gold, pearl (bdellium), and precious stones (Gen. 2:11-12; Rev. 21:18-21). Fourth, both sections speak of a counterpart, a wife (Gen. 2:18, 21-24; Rev. 21:9). These four points are the main content of the first two chapters and the last two chapters of the Bible. If we remove these four points from Genesis 1&mdash;2 and Revelation 21&mdash;22, these four chapters would not have much content. Therefore, the content of the first two chapters and the last two chapters of the Bible truly reflect each other.</p><h2 class="head3">Dissimilarities</h2>
<p>Although the first and last sections are a reflection, there are still considerable dissimilarities. First, in the first section the tree of life is outside man, outside Adam; however, in the last section the tree of life is inside man. Revelation 22:2 says that the tree of life grows in the New Jerusalem. We must understand that the New Jerusalem is a corporate man, and Adam in Genesis 2 is also a corporate man. Adam represents not only Adam but also all his descendants, those who come out of him. Therefore, Adam is a corporate man. The New Jerusalem is also a corporate man. Inscribed on the gates of the New Jerusalem there are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel, and on the twelve foundations there are the names of the twelve apostles (Rev. 21:12, 14). These two groups of people represent God&rsquo;s chosen people in the Old Testament and all those saved by grace in the New Testament. At the beginning of the Bible the tree of life is outside this corporate man Adam, but at the end the tree of life is inside this corporate man, the holy city. Ultimately, the tree of life is mingled with man. The tree of life is in man and grows in man.</p>
<p>Second, the gold, bdellium, and precious stones in Genesis 2 are in contrast to Adam, a man of clay. However, at the end of Revelation, all the Old Testament and New Testament saints, represented by the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel and the twelve apostles, are no longer earthy; they have become gold, pearl, and precious stones (21:12, 14, 18-21). It is more accurate to say that the man of clay is transformed; the earthy nature is gone, but the person remains.</p>
<p>Third, in Genesis 2 the three kinds of materials&mdash;gold, bdellium, and precious stones&mdash;are merely materials; they have not yet been built together (vv. 11-12). However, in Revelation 21 and 22 these three materials have been built up as the New Jerusalem (21:18-21). On one hand, this building is the tabernacle and dwelling place of God among men (v. 3), and on the other hand, this building is the bride and counterpart of the Lamb (v. 2).</p>
<p>If we see a clear picture of the beginning and the end of the Bible, we will be greatly helped in knowing the Scriptures. When we look at the Bible with this view, we must acknowledge that the very beginning of the Bible brings out God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. Genesis 1 and 2 present a clear picture. If we see this picture, we will be able to fully understand God&rsquo;s heart and know what God is doing in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENT OF<br />
THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS OF GENESIS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God Creating Man<br />
with His Image and Dominion</h2>
<p>There are four crucial points in Genesis 1 and 2. Genesis 1 clearly indicates that God created the heavens, the earth, and all things. In creation God&rsquo;s focus was on life. There are millions of wonderful, colorful things that exist in the universe, but only one chapter in Genesis gives a record of their creation, and this record is very brief. The opening statement of the Bible is, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; (v. 1). Then the record concerning God&rsquo;s work of six days is wholly on life, beginning with things without life to things with life. The record of the things with life begins with the plant life, the lowest form of life without any consciousness, and goes on to animal life, a higher form of life with consciousness. The record of the animal life begins from the lowest consciousness to the highest consciousness. At the end of this record man, possessing the highest form of life among all creatures, was created. However, this man is a corporate man. God did not create many men; He created one man&mdash;Adam. Even though man became fruitful and multiplied, all men come from this one man. God did not create many scattered men but one corporate man. God wants this man to express Him in His image and represent Him with His dominion (v. 26). God created a corporate man so that man with God&rsquo;s image and dominion may express Him and represent Him in the universe.</p>
<p>Although God created man in His image and with His authority, man still needs God to enter into him to be his life and to live in him. Therefore, the first crucial point in Genesis 1&mdash;2 is that man is the highest form of created life, because he was made in God&rsquo;s image and given God&rsquo;s dominion. However, in these two chapters God&rsquo;s intention was not accomplished, because God did not enter into man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Creating Man with a Spirit<br />
So That Man Can Receive Him as Life</h2>
<p>The second crucial point in chapter 2 is that God created man with a spirit and placed man in front of the tree of life, a symbol of God Himself as life (vv. 7-9). This means that God wants man to receive God, who is Spirit, in his spirit. The tree of life has many significances, but its main significance is that God in the Son can be received as life. The tree of life is actually Christ (John 15:1, 5). God formed man from dust and breathed the breath of life into him to form a human spirit within him (Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27). This human spirit is for man to receive God into himself as his life. God can enter into man as life in the Son. First John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; Life is in the Son of God. As the Spirit, the Son of God enters into man (John 20:22). Hence, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;wants to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life.</p><h2 class="head2">The Life of God Entering into Man<br />
for Man&rsquo;s Transformation</h2>
<p>The third crucial point in Genesis 2 is the flowing river. Once the divine life enters into man, it becomes rivers of living water (John 7:38). The divine life within man is not inactive or stagnant; it is operative, lively, and flowing, just like a river. The issue of this flowing is transformation. Experienced gold miners say that many treasures are produced where water flows. The Bible reveals that gold, bdellium, and precious stones are produced where living water flows (Gen. 2:11-12). Man was made of clay, but by entering into man, the Triune God mingles with man. Hence, God&rsquo;s golden nature is added to man&rsquo;s earthy nature. Gold is a fundamental element; it is not produced through a process of transformation, but pearls and precious stones are produced through transformation.</p>
<p>Bible students acknowledge that gold signifies God&rsquo;s nature. When God&rsquo;s golden element enters into man to be man&rsquo;s life and nature, man is regenerated. After man is regenerated, transformation begins in order to produce &ldquo;pearls.&rdquo; Even though we are made of clay, we can become pearls because we are regenerated and transformed in the wound of Christ. First there is gold, then pearls, and then precious stones. From the day we are regenerated, God&rsquo;s life is in us, doing a work of transformation. This is the story of the precious stones. Precious stones are clay that has been transformed through high heat and pressure. Prior to the process of transformation, the base materials for diamonds and jade have no value, but through transformation they become valuable stones. From the moment we are regenerated, God&rsquo;s life is operating within us and leading us. At the same time God also raises up outward circumstances to discipline us. These two matters, one within us and one without, coordinate to consume us and press us so that we can be transformed daily and as a result become precious stones.</p>
<p>After God&rsquo;s nature enters into us, it causes our earthy nature to be transformed gradually into pearl and precious stones. This corresponds to what is revealed in Revelation 21. The New Jerusalem is pure gold (v. 18), its gates are of pearls (v. 21), and the foundations of the wall of the city are adorned with every precious stone (vv. 19-20). Verse 11 says that the New Jerusalem has the glory of God and that her light is like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone. The light of the city is like a most precious stone, and the city has God&rsquo;s glory, the expression of God. The appearance of the city is like a jasper stone, which is the appearance of God (4:3). The New Jerusalem is a jasper city; it is completely like God in appearance. This city is the result of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work on all those who are saved. The life of God enters into us with the nature of God and operates in us continuously. The result of this continuous operation is our being transformed into pearls and precious stones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Transformed Precious Materials<br />
Needing to Be Built Up</h2>
<p>The fourth point in Genesis 1&mdash;2 is that the gold, bdellium, and precious stones are truly valuable and useful only when they are built up. Genesis 2 speaks of a woman after speaking of the river and the three precious materials. This implies that these precious materials must be built up into a woman, a counterpart. Some may feel that this interpretation is arbitrary, but it is based on Revelation 21, which says that the New Jerusalem, a city built with these three materials, is a bride, a woman (vv. 2, 9-10). Hence, the man of clay is a corporate man who, by receiving the life of God into him, obtains the element of gold, which issues in his transformation into pearl and precious stones. The gold, pearl, and precious stones are then built up into a corporate woman as the counterpart and dwelling place of God.</p>
<p>The built-up city shows the desire of God&rsquo;s heart. The man Adam, whom God created in the beginning, typifies a corporate man who expresses God in His image and represents and rules for God with His dominion. At the end of Revelation the New Jerusalem has the glory of God and is like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal (21:11). This is to express God in His image. Furthermore, the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, His slaves will serve Him, and they will reign with Him forever and ever (22:3, 5). This is to represent God with His dominion. The four crucial points in the first two chapters of Genesis have a full development and consummation in the last two chapters of Revelation. By receiving God as life, men of clay receive the element of gold and become pearls and precious stones through transformation; they are also built together into a city, which is God&rsquo;s counterpart and God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This marvelous city in God&rsquo;s image and with God&rsquo;s dominion expresses God and represents Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL VISION OF<br />
THE TWO BEGINNING AND TWO ENDING<br />
CHAPTERS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God Wanting to Gain a Builded Corporate Man</h2>
<p>Genesis 1&mdash;2 and Revelation 21&mdash;22, the beginning and ending of the Bible, present a picture of God&rsquo;s intention. God&rsquo;s intention was beginning to be carried out in Genesis 1 and 2 when the serpent, God&rsquo;s adversary, came in chapter 3. After the serpent came in, there were many efforts to undermine God&rsquo;s intention, but God never gave up on His intention and goal. Everything that God&rsquo;s adversary, Satan, does is aimed at undermining God&rsquo;s intention and goal. The serpent&rsquo;s injecting sin into man, which resulted in death in man, was aimed at destroying God&rsquo;s goal, God&rsquo;s desire for a vessel to contain Him. However, God did not stop working and even became flesh in order to deal with the serpent, to deal with man&rsquo;s sin brought in by the serpent, and to deal with the death brought in by sin. God intends to accomplish His desire. Ultimately, the problems related to Satan, sin, and death will be resolved, and the Son of God and the righteousness and life that He brings will gain the full victory. Now God has entered into men of clay with His nature of gold so that they can be transformed into pearls and precious stones. Their earthy element will be completely transformed, and they will be gold, pearls, and precious stones. God is within us to be our life, to live in us, and to be expressed through us. We can shine forth God, express Him in His image, and represent Him with His dominion.</p>
<p>This picture gives a clear impression that there is no room for individuals. The ultimate issue of God&rsquo;s desire is that there would be one body, one corporate entity, not many individuals. He does not want many transformed individuals but instead wants one transformed and built-up corporate entity. At the end of Genesis 2, God built one woman. At the end of the whole Bible, the issue of God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages is one city, and this city is also one woman. Hence, the ultimate issue of God&rsquo;s work is one building. Therefore, in this work there is no room for individuals. Rather, the many are part of one corporate entity. In order to have the building, we, as men of clay, need to receive God as life. After the divine life enters into us, through its flowing and through transformation, pearls and precious stones are produced. However, it is not sufficient for these precious materials to be scattered. Eventually, these materials need to be built up. This is the central vision of the Bible. This central vision includes the work of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in us.</p>
<p>It is very good that we preach the gospel to people so that they can receive God&rsquo;s life. It is also good that we help new believers learn to let the Holy Spirit do a transforming work within them so that they may advance and grow before God. However, this is not God&rsquo;s final goal. God&rsquo;s final goal is for the gold, pearls, and precious stones, the transformed people, to be built up as one entity. These transformed people include God&rsquo;s elect, represented by the twelve tribes of Israel in the Old Testament, and the believers, represented by the twelve apostles in the New Testament. This is the ultimate vision of the Bible. God will not arrive at His goal merely by our earthy nature being changed to gold, pearls, and precious stones. There is still a need for these materials to be built up. Similarly, in terms of our work, our leading people to be saved, to love the Lord, and to be transformed into gold, pearls, and precious stones do not achieve God&rsquo;s goal. That is merely the work of the first half of Genesis 2; it is not the work of building the woman in the second half of chapter 2. The gold, pearls, and precious stones need to be built up into a woman.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Work of the Apostles Being<br />
for the Building of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians was written by the apostle Paul according to the will of God. In chapter 1 Paul says that the church is the Body of Christ (vv. 22-23) and in chapter 4 that God &ldquo;gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ&rdquo; (vv. 11-12). According to Paul, apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are for the building up of the Body of Christ. In 2:22, concerning the church being the dwelling place of God, Paul says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; In verses 24 and 25 of chapter 5 Paul speaks of the church being the counterpart and wife of Christ. Bible expositors recognize that the book of Ephesians is concerning the church and that the church is the Body of Christ, the dwelling place of God, and the counterpart of Christ. However, it is difficult to find books or messages in Christianity concerning the building up of the church. At most, we can find some literature that refers to the church as an aggregate of all the saved ones, but there is no explanation as to how this aggregate comes into being.</p><h2 class="head2">What We Are and What We Do<br />
Needing to Be for God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to gain the builded church; therefore, the work of the apostles is for the building up of the church. We need to examine ourselves in order to know how much of the reality of the building of the church we have. We first need to ask how much we are built up. Building is different from edification. Edification is to make that which is improper in us proper, but building is to join us together with others. It may be difficult for us to be joined to others, but through building we are joined with others. Building not only makes us proper but also delivers us from individuality and joins us with others. Hence, the first question we need to answer concerns our relationship with others. With whom do we have the real building? Are we built together with all the saints? Second, we have to ask whether our work builds up the church. Are we satisfied with merely leading people to salvation so that they are regenerated, transformed, and changed into God&rsquo;s image? Is there a building element in our work? After we lead people to salvation and help them experience transformation so that they can become valuable material&mdash;gold, pearls, and precious stones&mdash;we need to help them to be built up. However, we often do a work only of edification, not a work of building.</p>
<p>The Bible presents a clear picture that God not only wants to gain valuable materials, but He also wants these materials to be built up into a dwelling place. God does not want these valuable materials to be individual items for exhibition. He wants these valuable materials to be built up into a dwelling place. Hence, we must ask whether we have been built up and whether the result of our work can complete this building. Even if we are satisfied that those under our care are gold, pearls, and precious stones, God is not satisfied. Gold is precious, pearls are lovely, and precious stones are beautiful, but God is not satisfied with just this. God wants a building. While He certainly does not want anything of clay, He wants gold, pearls, and precious stones that have been built up.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building Being a Matter of Today,<br />
Not of the Future</h2>
<p>Ephesians speaks particularly concerning the church and uses many spiritual utterances, including, &ldquo;blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies&rdquo; (1:3), &ldquo;chose us in Him before the foundation of the world&rdquo; (v. 4), &ldquo;sealed with the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 13), &ldquo;His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all&rdquo; (v. 23), and &ldquo;being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit&rdquo; (2:22). Many believers focus their attention on the spiritual blessings, on choosing, and on sealing, but they do not pay enough attention to the building of the Body. We cannot treat the words concerning the church as abstract or as being spiritual and heavenly and only for the future. If the things concerning the church were indeed for the future, for the heavens, God would have no need to speak about them, because there are many things in heaven that God does not make known to us. God makes known to us the things concerning the church because they are for today, for the present. However, where is this building? Where is the builded church today? There are groups of Christians everywhere. It is not hard to find lovers of the Lord, and many believers pursue spirituality, but where is the builded church?</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3 the apostle Paul says that we are God&rsquo;s fellow workers for building the saints into God&rsquo;s temple (vv. 9, 17). Therefore, this building work is not something of the future. If it were something of the future, then 1 Timothy 3:15 would not make sense. This verse says, &ldquo;If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God.&rdquo; If this house were not for today, why would Paul tell Timothy how to conduct himself in the house of God? If there were no such building on the earth, how could there be a house of God? If building is for the future, God&rsquo;s house would also be for the future; God would not have a house on the earth in this age, and we could only hope that God would have a house in the future. Such an interpretation is erroneous, because today on the earth God has a house, and this house is the church of the living God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTER OF THE BIBLE BEING<br />
THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Center of the Old Testament<br />
Being the Tabernacle and the Temple of God</h2>
<p>On the one hand, Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 speaks negatively of a serpent bringing in sin and death and positively of Christ the Son of God bringing in righteousness and life. On the other hand, however, the Bible speaks of the house of God, the temple of God. The center of the Old Testament is the tabernacle and the temple. The tabernacle is the precursor of the temple. The temple and the tabernacle are actually one. The tabernacle was erected in Exodus after the children of Israel left Egypt. From the time of their exodus from Egypt, the tabernacle was among them. From the time the tabernacle was erected until the temple was built to replace the tabernacle, the move of Israel was focused on the tabernacle. In the age of the kings, the temple was the center of Israel. When the temple was built, the glory of God filled the temple, and the temple had God&rsquo;s presence (1 Kings 8:10-11). Later, the temple was destroyed and became desolate, and the children of Israel were taken into captivity and scattered. After a period of time, the temple was rebuilt and remained through the end of the Old Testament age.</p><h2 class="head3">Noah&rsquo;s Household Being Saved<br />
through Building the Ark</h2>
<p>The Bible shows that from the time of Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Noah, God&rsquo;s eyes were set on the tabernacle because He desires to have a habitation on earth among men. If we have insight, we will see that God&rsquo;s eyes were always set on the tabernacle and the temple. However, the descendants of Adam did not reach God&rsquo;s purpose. Rather, they were utilized by Satan, became Satan&rsquo;s building materials, and even built a city for Satan (Gen. 11:4). As a result, God could not find anyone on the earth to build His habitation. When God judged the world with the flood, Noah&rsquo;s household was saved through building the ark, and the earth had a new beginning (6:11&mdash;9:17). However, Noah&rsquo;s descendants formed nations and were utilized again by Satan to build the city of Babel (11:1-4). As a result, God was left with no one as material for His dwelling. Thus, God judged Babel and confounded man&rsquo;s language (v. 7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">God Calling Abraham and His Seed<br />
to Build the House of God</h2>
<p>God called Abraham, and charged him to go forth from his land and from his relatives and from his father&rsquo;s house to the land that God would show him (12:1). God also promised Abraham that He would give that land to his seed (vv. 7; 13:14-17). God promised Abraham two things: land and descendants. The land would serve as the site of God&rsquo;s house, and the descendants would be the materials for the building of God&rsquo;s habitation. Abraham waited for the fulfillment of this promise, and his son Isaac also waited. Later, this promise was passed on to Jacob, the son of Isaac. Although Jacob was not the firstborn, he sought the birthright and employed crafty means to cheat his older brother and gain the birthright. Jacob, being hated by his older brother, was forced to leave his parents and flee to his uncle&rsquo;s house (25:29-34; 27:5-46). While Jacob was fleeing to his uncle&rsquo;s house, he had a dream in which he saw a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on the ladder. God was standing above the ladder, and He blessed Jacob. When Jacob awoke, he took the stone that he had put under his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it. He considered this place to be the house of God, the gate of heaven, and called the name of this place Bethel, which means &ldquo;house of God&rdquo; (28:10-19). This indicated that God would raise up the sons of Jacob to be His house.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Israel Being the Real Habitation of God</h2>
<p>The sons of Jacob later became a great race, but they were enslaved in Egypt (Exo. 1:1-14). God delivered them out of Egypt and raised up the tabernacle among them (40:17). We must understand this with spiritual insight: the erecting of the tabernacle was the beginning of God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. From then on God was watchful of this tabernacle. The tabernacle can be considered as the symbol and figure of Israel. However, the tabernacle itself was not God&rsquo;s habitation; Israel was God&rsquo;s habitation. The tabernacle was a symbol, a type. When Israel was in a normal situation, God dwelt among them; when Israel was not in a normal situation, God did not dwell among them. Psalm 133 says, &ldquo;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is / For brothers to dwell in unity! / ...Like the dew of Hermon / That came down upon the mountains of Zion&rdquo; (vv. 1, 3). These verses refer to the condition of God&rsquo;s habitation, the tabernacle and the temple. When God&rsquo;s people dwelt together in unity, they were God&rsquo;s habitation on earth, and God dwelt among them. When they were apostate and desolate, God went out from among them, and the temple was destroyed. Before the end of the Old Testament age, God restored the children of Israel, and the temple was rebuilt.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The New Testament Focusing on Building<br />
the Church as the House of God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Being Built through<br />
the Lord&rsquo;s Death and Resurrection</h2>
<p>The New Testament speaks of the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. God wants us not only to be spiritual and God-fearing men but also to be those who can dwell with God&rsquo;s people together in unity, who can be coordinated into one entity, and who become a spiritual temple as His dwelling place. John 1:14 says that the Lord Jesus, as the Word, &ldquo;became flesh and tabernacled among us..., full of grace and reality.&rdquo; In chapter 2 when the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (v. 19), He spoke of the temple of His body (v. 21). He seemed to be saying that the Jews would crucify Him, but in three days He would be raised up. This means that the Lord would resurrect three days after His death to build up the mystical Body as God&rsquo;s temple. The physical body that the Jews destroyed on the cross was what the Lord Jesus put on in incarnation. The Body that was raised up when He resurrected from the dead is a mystical Body. Through His resurrection from death He imparted His life into us and regenerated us so that we became members of His Body. After we enter the gates of the New Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit does a work of resurrection in us, stripping us of our earthy element and bringing everything in us into resurrection so that we can be transformed in resurrection and built together into the Lord&rsquo;s mystical Body. This mystical Body is the church and also the temple built by the Lord in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Apostles Building the Church<br />
with Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus first spoke of the church in Matthew 16:18, saying, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; When He first spoke of the church, He spoke of building. The apostles also preached concerning the building of the church. The purpose of the work was not merely for people to be saved, to be spiritual, to be consecrated, and to become gold, pearls, and precious stones. The work of the apostles was for the building of the church. In 1 Corinthians 3:12 the apostle Paul says that some build with gold, silver, and precious stones, and others, with wood, grass, and stubble. The work of the apostles was to build the church with gold, silver, and precious stones. Their work was not merely a matter of salvation or transformation. Their desire was to build the church of God with valuable materials.</p>
<p>The New Testament takes the line of God&rsquo;s house as its center, which house is the church built by the apostles. This church is not abstract but specific; it is built in every locality. The Bible clearly states that the church is to be built in locality after locality (Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5). God builds His dwelling place in the New Testament age by building the church as His dwelling place. The practical way to build God&rsquo;s dwelling place is to gain people to have God&rsquo;s life and be built together through the transformation work of the Holy Spirit into a dwelling place of God in every locality. This is God&rsquo;s desire, God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ Being the Head<br />
and the Church Being His Body</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire must be accomplished in Christ His Son. God is embodied in the Son, and the Son has the first place and the preeminence in the universe so that He can be expressed and glorified. Not only so, the Son of God is expressed in the church, He is the Head of the church, and the church is His Body (Col. 1:18-19; Eph. 1:22-23). The Head and the Body are equally crucial, and Christ and the church are balanced truths in the Bible. We must not neglect either. The vision at the end of Revelation shows that God&rsquo;s redeemed throughout the ages become a city. Christ, the Lamb who was slain, is the lamp of the city, and God is the light of the city (21:23). This means that God is in Christ, and Christ is in the church. God is expressed in Christ, and Christ is expressed in the church. Ephesians 3:21 says, &ldquo;To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen.&rdquo; This verse does not say, &ldquo;To God in Christ be the glory,&rdquo; but &ldquo;To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This means that He is to be expressed in the church. All that God is, is for Christ, and all that Christ is, is for the church.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, the Bible speaks of this building. This building is for Christ and takes Christ as its center and everything. Christ&rsquo;s being the center and His being everything depend on this building. When this building is damaged, Christ cannot be seen as the center and cannot be expressed as everything. Christ and the church are two aspects of the divine vision. They are the mysteries of God and are the corporate man in the universe, with Christ being the Head and the church being His Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE REVELATION OF THE BLUEPRINT<br />
FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PICTURE OF<br />
THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE OF GOD<br />
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The blueprint for God&rsquo;s building is revealed in the Scriptures. The Old Testament presents a picture of the building of the temple of God. First Chronicles 28:11-14 says, &ldquo;David gave Solomon his son the pattern of the portico of the temple and its buildings and its storehouses and its upper rooms and its inner rooms and the building for the expiation cover; and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Jehovah, and for all the chambers around, and for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the dedicated gifts; and for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and for all the vessels of the service of the house of Jehovah; and for the gold, by weight of the gold for all the vessels of each kind of service; for all the vessels of silver, by weight for all the vessels for each kind of service.&rdquo; Verses 20 through 21 say, &ldquo;David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and be bold and do it; do not be afraid or dismayed, for Jehovah God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you until the completion of all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah. And here are the divisions of priests and Levites for all the service of the house of God, and with you in all the work will be every willing man with wisdom for any service; also the leaders and all the people will be wholly at your command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These verses show how the temple of God was built. The first point is the pattern (vv. 11-12, 19). The word <em>pattern</em> indicates a certain standard. It is not according to your will or according to my will. The revealed pattern became the standard of the work of the service. How and what the service carried out were based on the pattern.</p>
<p>Next, according to the pattern, there were various needs, and based on the needs, work was assigned. The divisions of the priests and Levites were according to the assignments (vv. 13, 21). Third, all the vessels of the service had certain weights; there could not be too much or too little material (vv. 14-18). Therefore, everything in the building of the temple of God was done according to the pattern, including the divisions of the priests and Levites and the quantities of the vessels. Nothing was added to the pattern. Moreover, willing men with wisdom for any service came to help (v. 21). Because the Lord was with the children of Israel, they had wisdom and were willing to serve. Finally, the leaders and all the people were wholly at Solomon&rsquo;s command (v. 21). <em>Command</em> here indicates that authority is involved. All the people being wholly at Solomon&rsquo;s command is a matter of being in one accord&mdash;the hearts of the many were as one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL HOUSE AND THE PRIESTHOOD<br />
BEING ONE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>In the New Testament 1 Peter 2:5 says, &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In this verse the spiritual house is the holy priesthood, and the holy priesthood is the spiritual house. Some may think that the spiritual house refers to a thing and that the priesthood refers to a group of people. In the Old Testament the house and the priesthood were separate, but in the New Testament the house is the priesthood, and the priesthood is the house. All of God&rsquo;s children, that is, all those who are being built up, are, on the one hand, the house of God, and on the other, priests of God. We are priests, and we are also a house. Therefore, 1 Peter 2:5 says that we, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood. We are the habitation of God and also the ones who serve God. Furthermore, we are not individual priests; we are a corporate priest, a holy priesthood.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the priesthood was associated with the temple. Whether in relation to the tabernacle or the temple, the priests were not separate; they were in coordination. They served as a corporate entity, a &ldquo;-hood,&rdquo; according to divisions and orders. Thus, the priesthood was not separated from the temple. The priesthood with the temple shows that the temple is a body of priests and that the building of the temple involves the coordination of the priests. The priests&rsquo; being coordinated into one corporate entity is the building of the temple into one entity.</p>
<p>Although 1 Chronicles 28 speaks about the pattern and method for the building of the temple, a depiction of the priestly divisions, work, and services is integrated into the chapter as well. Thus, the Holy Spirit indicates that these two are one. This is the same principle in Exodus. The priesthood&mdash;the priestly service, work, and garments&mdash;is integrated into the section concerning the building of the tabernacle and its furnishings (25:9&mdash;40:17).</p>
<p>If we start from the inside of the tabernacle, the furnishings are the Ark, the incense altar, the golden lampstand, the table of the bread of the Presence, the laver, and the altar. When we start from the outer court, the furnishings are the altar, the laver, the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, the incense altar, and the Ark. However, the sequence given in Exodus 25, the pattern for the building, is the Ark (vv. 10-22), the table of the bread of the Presence (vv. 23-30), the lampstand (vv. 31-40), the coverings and the standing boards of the tabernacle (26:1-37), the altar of burnt offering (27:1-8), and the hangings for the court (27:9-19). The pattern for the incense altar and the laver are omitted in this section. The pattern for the incense altar (30:1-10) is given after the priestly garments (28:1-43) and the sanctification of Aaron and his sons, the priests (29:1-46). The pattern for the laver (30:17-21) is given with the instructions concerning the priests&rsquo; going into the Tent of Meeting to serve God (v. 20). Hence, two items, the incense altar and the laver, are linked with the priests and are not spoken of with the furniture of the inner and outer courts of the tabernacle. We need to consider these matters. In this portion of the Scriptures the Holy Spirit indicates that the building of God and the coordination of the priests are one, and in the New Testament the two are one and inseparable.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTLY SERVICE&mdash;<br />
BEING BUILT UP AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>Through these pictures in the Old Testament, the Lord shows us two sides of one matter. One aspect of our work is to be built up, and another aspect is to build. We are building by being built up. This is to genuinely serve God as priests. Some may think that to serve God is to do the work of God and to live for God. This is the general understanding in Christianity. However, to serve God as a priest is to build the temple of God, which also is to be built up. We are proper priests carrying out the genuine building work only when we are genuinely built up. We cannot separate the priestly service from building. A believer who serves as a priest apart from the temple of God has an improper priesthood. Any priestly service that is separated from the building, that is, from the temple of God as the ground for the priestly service, is improper. This is a tremendous light that we must see: our priesthood must be in the building and for the building. For us to serve as priests is for us to build.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:5 says that the proper service cannot be apart from the building. When we are built up as a spiritual house, we become a priesthood. <em>To offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God</em> refers to our work. When we are built up into a priesthood, we can have work that is acceptable to God. For centuries those who love God have known that they should serve God. But few believers have seen that the basic matter of serving God depends on being built up. If we are not built up as the spiritual house of God, there will be no priesthood. The priesthood is based on the building. When God&rsquo;s children begin to love God, they are very willing to serve God. However, they neglect the matter of being built up. Once a person becomes zealous, he wants to serve, but God speaks of being built up into a spiritual house as the basic condition for service. We cannot serve if we are not built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING IN A CORPORATE PRIESTHOOD,<br />
NOT ALONE</h2>
<p>We can see from the picture presented in the Bible that building involves coordination. For a Levite to be a priest, zeal was not enough; he also had to be coordinated in the priestly divisions. This is a type of passing through the process of being built up in the building and habitation of God. The habitation of God is the priesthood; the two are one. We need to be built into and coordinated into the building. Then we will have the proper ground to serve. We are not individuals who serve alone; we serve in a corporate body, the priesthood.</p>
<p>Whether in the service according to the pattern revealed in Exodus 25, which is the Old Testament priestly service, or in the New Testament apostolic service, there is no individual service. Some may say that in Acts Philip served alone. However, a careful reading of Acts 8 shows that Philip was not doing a work by himself. Philip seemed to be led to do a work by himself; however, Philip was actually in a corporate body. Verses 4 through 13 speak of Philip&rsquo;s preaching in Samaria, and verses 14 through 25 speak of the confirmation by the apostles.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament service, only one priest went into the temple to burn incense, but the burning of incense was the responsibility of the priesthood. Similarly, Philip&rsquo;s work was within the service of a corporate entity. He was led to go alone but was joined to the corporate entity. There are no incidents in the Scriptures of individual service, either in the Old Testament or in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE ACCORDING TO THE BLUEPRINT</h2>
<p>The kind of work that God wants on the earth today is consistent in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. He wants to build a habitation for Himself. The Tent of Meeting that the children of Israel built in the wilderness was an initial work. The tabernacle had three sections. The outer court contained the altar, the laver, and the hangings. In the Holy Place there were the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar. The innermost section, the Holy of Holies, had the Ark. This was the building work of the tabernacle. The building of the temple occurred at the time of fullness after the children of Israel entered into the good land. The same furnishings were still present in the temple, but the temple was stabilized and enlarged with materials such as valuable stones, cedar, cypress, and olive wood (1 Kings 6:7, 15-16, 23).</p>
<p>The principle involved in building the tabernacle and the temple was the same: the building was done according to the blueprint given by God, and it was linked to the service of the priesthood. This shows that our service cannot be lacking in these two things. We must have the full vision of what God wants on the earth, and under this vision, those in the service need to be built together as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood. On the one hand, we need a full vision of what God wants. On the other hand, we need to be built together with those in the service into a spiritual house and a holy priesthood to carry out this vision.</p><h2 class="head2">The Altar</h2>
<p>The building service first includes the work of the gospel, as indicated by the altar (Exo. 27:1-8). The altar typifies the cross of Christ. On the cross He accomplished redemption for us. The gospel needs to spread and be preached far and wide. The altar in the tabernacle was five cubits square (v. 1) and was enlarged in the temple to be twenty cubits square (2 Chron. 4:1). Thus, the gospel must be widely spread.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Laver and the Hangings</h2>
<p>The next item of service is related to the laver (Exo. 30:17-21), which denotes the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s dealings with us. These dealings remove all our uncleanness and dross by the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s shining, purifying, and purging. Third, the hangings for the outer court of the tabernacle (27:9-19) are produced. This causes our walk to be separated from the world. Worldly people are numb concerning sin and are defiled in their walk. Through the redemption accomplished on the cross and the dealing of the Holy Spirit, we are made clean and separated from the world in our conduct, living, and work. We preach the gospel of the vicarious death of Christ on the cross and of our co-death with Christ. We also preach the shining, purifying, and purging of the Holy Spirit. At the same time, we preach a life and walk that are separated from the people of the world and worthy of our calling and the grace that we have received. This is the work that we do.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ark</h2>
<p>Our work should also cause others to know the inner life. We should bring the saints to know Christ within them and to know how God in His Son can be our life and our treasure within. The Ark, which typifies Christ, was in the Holy of Holies (25:10-22). Today Christ lives in us. Within the Ark were the commandments of God. The commandments of God being within the Ark indicates that God is in Christ. The commandments within the Ark signify the revealed God, the manifested God, and the expressed God, because the commandments are the expression and revelation of God. We should not regard the commandments as something negative. On the contrary, the significance of the Ten Commandments is very deep and spiritual. The commandments are the explanation of God, telling us what God is.</p>
<p>The Ten Commandments are an explanation of God. The fact that the Ten Commandments were placed inside the Ark indicates that the explanation of God is in Christ. The Ark was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, indicating that Christ has both divinity and humanity. His humanity is signified by acacia wood; however, what is expressed from Him is divinity, as signified by the gold that overlays the acacia wood. The frame of the Ark is wood, but the expression is pure gold. The frame and framework of the Lord Jesus is humanity, but divinity is manifested in Him. One of the many items related to the Ark is the expiation cover. We need to have a clear understanding of the many items not only for ourselves but also for us to bring others to know these items in their experience.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Table of the Bread of the Presence,<br />
the Golden Lampstand, and the Incense Altar</h2>
<p>Furthermore, we need to know the Holy Place. In the record of Exodus, following the Ark is the table of the bread of the Presence, which is also wood overlaid with gold (vv. 23-25). The table of the bread of the Presence indicates that Christ, who dwells within us with both His divinity and humanity, is our life supply. The Lord Jesus has both divinity and humanity. His humanity is the framework to express His divinity. This One who dwells in us is the table of the bread of the Presence. His being in us as the life supply has not only the aspect of humanity but also the aspect of divinity. Furthermore, He is our light, as indicated by the golden lampstand (vv. 31-40). The golden lampstand emphasizes divinity, because God is light. In the Holy Place there is also the incense altar (30:1-10), which indicates that Christ is the Intercessor who causes us to be acceptable to God.</p>
<p>These are the items that we should preach: the altar, the laver, the hangings, the Ark, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar. Saying that we must preach these things does not mean that we have not done such a work in the past but that we have been inadequate. We do not necessarily need to explain the types, but we should preach the redemption of the cross, the shining and renewing of the Holy Spirit, and the Lord&rsquo;s holiness and righteousness saturating our living. In addition, we should speak more concerning the glorious Christ and His riches becoming our inner life and life supply. We need to learn to receive His supply, live by this supply, and stand before God, enjoying Him in the light. In this way our inner being will be bright, full of God&rsquo;s light. Under His shining, we will have the incense altar and be acceptable to God. Our preaching should have the New Testament as its basis and be confirmed by our experience.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF OUR WORK&mdash;<br />
BUILDING THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD</h2>
<p>Moreover, our work has a goal, an ultimate consummation, which is to build up the church. The work of the cross, the work of the Holy Spirit, Christ&rsquo;s being in us as the testimony of God to be our life supply and light of life, and our being acceptable to God are for a glorious issue, a glorious goal. This goal is the building up of the dwelling place of God. Therefore, we also need to speak about the building of the church so that God can gain a glorious dwelling place.</p>
<p>Even though we have heard many messages on building, we cannot speak about building without the altar, the laver, the Ark, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar. We do not want the building to be like the tabernacle at Gibeon (Shiloh) (1 Sam. 4:3, 11; 2 Chron. 1:3-13). During the two thousand years that the church has been on the earth, she has at times been like the tabernacle at Gibeon&mdash;an empty shell. The church may have the work of the cross and the work of the gospel and yet be an empty shell. This is the case among some believers today. They do not have the Ark, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar. They lack Christ as life, and they do not have the manifestation and expression of Christ in His humanity as their life supply and light of life so that man in God and in resurrection can be acceptable to God. Many Christian groups are just congregations; they lack Christ as their content and are an empty tabernacle.</p>
<p>Other believers know Christ in a deep way, but they have not brought anyone to salvation, and they cannot be built up with others. They seem to have the presence of Christ in terms of the Ark, but they cannot be built with others. May the Lord have mercy on us and open our eyes so that our work would not miss the mark. We must never lack the knowledge of Christ when we preach the gospel or speak of the cross. We should never have the Ark, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar without the tabernacle. We need to bring people to salvation and to the dealings of the Holy Spirit. We also need to bring people to know Christ, experience Christ, live in Christ, receive Christ as light, and live before God in resurrection so that we will produce a testimony and have the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MUTUAL PERFECTING ACCORDING<br />
TO THE BLUEPRINT FOR THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>Our preaching of the gospel must include the dealing of the Holy Spirit and sanctification. We also need to bring the saints to know Christ, who is the God who has entered into man to be man&rsquo;s life so that man can receive the shining of the light of life. Besides these, we need to speak of the resurrection of Christ. We should live before God and be acceptable to God in the resurrected One. Furthermore, we should cause the saints to see that all this is for the building of God&rsquo;s glorious church. This is the blueprint for our work. As God&rsquo;s fellow workers, our work is building God&rsquo;s dwelling place. No matter what we do or what the extent of our work is, we must work according to this blueprint. This is the vision of our work. We must all work according to the blueprint.</p>
<p>A brother who is commissioned to preach the gospel should never do an individual gospel-preaching work. Instead of isolating himself, he should join himself to others when he preaches the gospel. His attitude should be that the more he preaches the gospel and brings people to salvation, the more the believers will have one heart toward the church and be joined together. If he has learned the lessons of fellowshipping with the Lord, being acceptable to God, and always interceding, these new believers will be the riches of the church; his work should continue. A brother who leads believers to fellowship with the Lord must guard against becoming isolated and producing an isolated sect in the church. In the past we have had this shortcoming. Our ministry is particular, but we need to have a proper attitude, and we need a spirit that is in harmony with and joined to others. If the fruit of our labor can be joined with the labor of others so that the saints who are helped are one in heart toward the church, the church will be built up.</p>
<p>A brother who is gifted in leading others to study the Scriptures should realize that these riches have been given to him by the Lord for the church. He should not neglect his service but be proper. He should also guard against forming a sect. Rather, he must be joined to others, coordinated with others, and in harmony with others in his service. This is what the apostle Paul dealt with in 1 Corinthians. He did not allow the Corinthians to be divisive. There was division among the Corinthians. Some were helped by Paul and said they were of Paul, and others were helped by Apollos and said they were of Apollos (1:12). Paul pointed out this mistake and said, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth&rdquo; (3:6). Both Paul&rsquo;s planting and Apollos&rsquo;s watering were for sustaining the growth of the saints; their labor was coordinated.</p>
<p>We must not have a spirit that divides and separates. Such an attitude is fleshly (vv. 3-4). If the service of a brother produces saints who support him and listen only to him, then his service and their support are fleshly. The saints should receive the perfecting of all the brothers, just as the Corinthians should have received Paul&rsquo;s portion, Apollos&rsquo;s portion, and Peter&rsquo;s portion. We should tell those who support only us that their support is of the flesh. If one brother says this concerning the service of another brother, it will cause contention; therefore, we should say this concerning ourselves. We should never help the saints with the intention of gaining their support. Our ministering should care for the saints, help them, and cause them to receive the perfecting of all the brothers. The ministering of the many brothers should mutually perfect the saints. In the church the saints should be harmoniously coordinated and built together.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GROUND FOR THE BUILDING<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROUND FOR THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, the site for the building of the temple was the threshing floor of Ornan on Mount Moriah (2 Chron. 3:1). If this had not been God&rsquo;s intention, it would not have been recorded in the Bible. The temple of God being built on the threshing floor of Ornan on Mount Moriah is not a small matter; it was a great event in the universe. If a temple had been built according to the same pattern and materials but in a different location, there would have been a serious problem of division among the Israelites. Using the same pattern, materials, and even builders, the Israelites could have chosen any location to build a temple. There could have been temples in the south, the north, the east, and the west, but the Israelites would inevitably have been divided.</p>
<p>God not only spoke of the pattern, the materials and their quantities, and the builders for building the temple, but He also chose the building site to be Mount Moriah. There was only one place for the building. This was the one ground that would forever keep the Israelites from being divided. Historically, however, the kingdom of Israel was divided into the northern kingdom and the southern kingdom because the northern kingdom forsook the one ground for the holy temple. The Israelites could build the temple on only one site. If the temple was to be built on the earth, it had to be built on this ground. Only the piece of land on Mount Moriah could be used for building the temple. Any other location would cause the Israelites to be divided.</p>
<p>For thirty years we have focused on the matter of the ground, emphasizing that the church is unique, that there can be only one local expression, and that the church can be built on only one ground. The church can be built on only one ground; apart from this ground the church cannot be built. If the building takes place apart from this ground, the church will be divided. The Lord has enlightened us in this matter so that we can fight the battle and contend for the ground of the church. This is an exceedingly great matter. If the temple had been built in a location other than the threshing floor of Ornan, many temples could have been built. However, for the past few thousand years of history there has been only one temple. Although the temple was destroyed, when it was rebuilt, it was built on the same ground.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY OF THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE</h2>
<p>The temple was built by Solomon (1 Kings 6). Then the temple was rebuilt two times. It was rebuilt at the time of Ezra (Ezra 3:6b-13; 6:13-15), and then by Herod (John 2:20). Herod did not rebuild the temple because it had been destroyed but because he felt that the temple built at the time of Ezra was not large enough or adequately restored. Based on political considerations, Herod, a Gentile king, rebuilt the temple in order to cope with the Jewish sentiment. Nevertheless, the temple was built at its designated site, not at another site. The Israelites did not annul the unique ground for the worship of God.</p>
<p>The children of Israel who were scattered among the nations built synagogues. Although the Israelites had synagogues, they knew that the synagogues could not replace the temple. The Jews must worship God, and they know that the place which God has appointed for His worship is the threshing floor of Ornan in Jerusalem; there cannot be another place of worship. During the time of the Roman Empire, the Israelites were scattered among the nations, but they did not abandon their worship of God. They did not have the proper ground on which to build the temple, so they built synagogues instead as places for worship. No Jew would dare to claim that a synagogue is the temple. There are many Jewish synagogues in New York, but no Jew would claim that a synagogue is the temple. The temple can be built only on the unique ground. This keeps the children of Israel from division. Even though the Jews are scattered, they are not divided. They are waiting to gain the unique ground for the temple.</p>
<p>The threshing floor of Ornan on Mount Moriah is the ground for the building of the temple. The third largest Muslim mosque was built on this site and still stands there. The largest mosque is in Mecca. The third largest mosque was built on the threshing floor of Ornan on Mount Moriah. Mount Moriah is also the place where Abraham offered up Isaac (Gen. 22:2). The Muslims recognize Abraham as their forefather.</p>
<p>The city of Jerusalem has suffered many wars and has had its walls demolished and rebuilt. Today the city of Jerusalem is situated on several peaks, and the threshing floor of Ornan, which is the building site of the temple, is on the city border. Mount Zion is one of the high peaks of the city of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The ancient fortress of David was on Mount Zion. This is also where he pitched a tent for the Ark (2 Sam. 6:17). Later God instructed David to build a temple on Mount Moriah, where his forefather Abraham had worshipped God (24:18-25; 1 Chron. 21:18&mdash;22:1; 2 Chron. 3:1). After Solomon, David&rsquo;s son, built the temple, he brought up the Ark from the city of David, which is Zion, into the temple (5:2; 1 Kings 8:1-11), and the tent that David had pitched was abandoned. At the same time, the Tent of Meeting in Shiloh with its vessels was moved into the temple, for Solomon merged the tabernacle with the temple (vv. 4-6). The tent that David pitched according to his will was abandoned. From then on, no matter how confused or troubled the children of Israel were, they had only one worship center. They could not build the temple anywhere other than the threshing floor of Ornan on Mount Moriah. This ground is unique and keeps the oneness of God&rsquo;s children. The ground is not the base or the material for the temple but the site for building the temple.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GROUND FOR BUILDING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We should apply the revelation concerning the building and location of the temple in the Old Testament to the building and ground of the church. The location for the building of the temple implies the ground of the church. According to church history, many truths in the Bible were recovered in the eighteenth century by brothers such as J. N. Darby, but they were still unclear concerning the ground of the church. These brothers saw that the churches in every locality are independent in administration, but they were unclear regarding the ground. The truth concerning the ground was not made clear until 1934. Brother Nee spent considerable time studying the Bible concerning the boundary of the church. He saw that the church can be established only according to a locality, such as the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, and the church in Ephesus (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 2:1). The establishing of one church in a locality is the ground for establishing the church.</p>
<p>We cannot establish a local church in a factory or in a school. A local church can be established only in a city. However, there are many details related to taking the ground. If there is already a local church in a city, another church cannot be established there; just as when there was a temple on the threshing floor of Ornan, another temple could not be built. An Israelite could accept only that temple and be joined to that temple. Suppose a brother goes to Tainan, and there is no church there. He has the liberty to establish a church because Tainan is a ground on which a church can be established. If there is already a church in Tainan, then he does not have the qualification or the liberty to establish another church. Taipei is also a locality, a ground, where a church can be established. However, since there is already a church in Taipei, another church cannot be established. The ground for establishing the church in Taipei has already been taken; hence, there is no ground on which to establish any other church. Believers can accept only the church in a locality and be blended into that church. Only thus can the oneness be kept wherever the church is expressed.</p>
<p>The thought that the church can be established apart from the ground of locality will produce many grounds and result in division. Once a church already exists in a locality, it is wrong to establish other churches in the same locality out of convenience for the believers. Regrettably, some believers have established churches outside the ground of locality. If we do not hold fast to the unique ground, the oneness of the church will easily be damaged.</p>
<p>If the children of Israel did not have the threshing floor of Ornan as the unique ground for the temple, many temples might have been built. Some Israelites could have built a square temple of wood overlaid with gold, and others, a long temple with the same material. Thus, the children of Israel would have been separated, and their worship of God would have been divided. God&rsquo;s people must be united in their worship. Once the worship of God is divided, God&rsquo;s people are divided. This means that once the place where we meet and worship God is divided, we are divided. Therefore, God, according to His wisdom, determined that there would be only one ground for establishing the church. That one ground is the unique ground of locality. There is no other ground allowed besides this ground.</p>
<p>The ground is the locality of a city, where people dwell and gather. Upon this ground the church&mdash;and only one church&mdash;may be established. Once a church is established, no other church can be established. All of God&rsquo;s children in that locality should be joined to that local church to keep the one ground. Only thus can God&rsquo;s children be kept from division, even though their opinions may differ. A believer may have opinions, but he does not have the liberty to establish another church. A brother may advocate baptism by immersion, but he cannot take that view of baptism as a ground on which to set up a church. Believers may hold different views on baptism, but they cannot and should not establish a church based on their view. However, for many years God&rsquo;s children have violated the unique ground and caused many divisions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUOTING THE SCRIPTURES ERRONEOUSLY</h2>
<p>Once the ground of the church is violated, not only can many churches be established in a city, but it is possible to establish the church on the ground of doctrine or practice. Opposers erroneously quote Matthew 18:20, which says, &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.&rdquo; Based on this verse, they say that as long as two or three believers are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name, the Lord is in their midst, and they are the church. However, we insist on the ground of the church because, according to the revelation in the Bible, only one church can be established in a city. There is no basis and no authority to establish the church on any other ground.</p>
<p>In Matthew 18:20 the Lord said that His disciples can be gathered into His name no matter where they are and that He will be in their midst, but He did not say that such a gathering is the church. In verses 16 through 17 the Lord said that if there is a problem between two or three, they should &ldquo;tell it to the church.&rdquo; These verses indicate that the two or three are not the church. The Bible does not say that the gathering of two or three believers is the church. We must be scriptural and not establish other grounds. Only the ground of locality can close the doors to church division.</p>
<p>A brother may advocate baptism by immersion or favor head covering, but no matter what he advocates or favors, he does not have the liberty to establish churches apart from the unique ground. In the Old Testament God told the children of Israel that they could not worship Him in the place of their choice. They had to worship God in the place that He chose to put His name (Deut. 12:5, 8, 11). God would not allow the children of Israel to build another temple besides the one built on the threshing floor of Ornan. The Israelites had to strictly comply with and practice this command. Regrettably, in the New Testament age God&rsquo;s people neglect this. Some believers are bold and use many excuses to come together outside the ground of locality and even set up so-called &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; churches. The desire to seek spirituality and holiness is good. But this desire has become an excuse for divisions among God&rsquo;s people, producing justification churches, holiness churches, and spiritual churches. Division should be condemned. The desire to preach the gospel in a factory is not a reason to establish a church in the factory. The excuse of preaching the gospel must be removed. Division cannot be justified, but rather it must be condemned. We must see the importance of the ground.</p><h2 class="head1">PROBLEMS</h2>
<p>We also have encountered problems. We have gained spiritual help from Madame Guyon, but if she were among us today, she might influence us to worship an idol of Mary, and we might be unable to resist. We also have been helped by Andrew Murray and even recommend his books to the saints, but if he were alive today, he might bring in a speaking that opposed the ground.</p>
<p>In the same principle, we highly esteem the spiritual supply of Brother T. Austin-Sparks. However, when we invited him to visit us, he should not have touched the matter of the ground. During his first visit in 1955, the fellowship was very good, and since he did not touch the ground, we invited him to come a second time. During his second visit in 1957, sadly, he touched the issue of the ground. At that time we had serious fellowship. He said that any gathering of two or three into the Lord&rsquo;s name is the church. Afterward, I visited him in London, and I was his guest of honor. We had countless talks together. In the end, however, he insisted that as long as a gathering is in Christ, it is on the ground of the church and that as long as two or three are gathered, the Lord is in their midst and that is the church.</p>
<p>We are not criticizing or opposing Brother Austin-Sparks, but he did not see the danger of this matter. If we accepted this kind of teaching, the church in Taipei could be divided into not only three or five groups but into dozens of groups. If we can say that any gathering of two or three is the church, then Taipei could have many churches. We fellowshipped this with Brother Austin-Sparks and said that if we practiced his fellowship, there would be the danger of endless divisions. However, Brother Austin-Sparks would not accept this word.</p>
<p>We need two views concerning our fellowship with Brother Austin-Sparks. His spirituality is unquestionable; we esteem it highly, just as we esteem Madame Guyon&rsquo;s spirituality. But we cannot accept Madame Guyon&rsquo;s idol worship in Catholicism. Likewise, we fully accept <em>The Spirit of Christ</em> by Andrew Murray, but we cannot accept the denomination that he was in. This requires discernment. We highly esteem and fully accept the spiritual fellowship from Brother Austin-Sparks, but his view regarding the ground is not scriptural, and we cannot accept it. The saints who were affected by him have caused serious problems.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>We were aware of the problems that could arise the first time we invited Brother Austin-Sparks. We were also aware of this when he spoke of the ground during his second visit. I did not initiate the fellowship concerning the ground. Sadly, some brothers among us did not keep their bounds. Regardless of their intention, a chaotic situation came in because they did not keep their bounds. The chaos that ensued did not allow us to invite Brother Austin-Sparks to come again. When our situation is stable, we can invite him for his spiritual portion. However, he should give us absolute freedom concerning our practice of the church.</p>
<p>I was not ignorant of our brother&rsquo;s view concerning our practice. I have known his view since I was in Shanghai. I invited him to visit us because our situation was stable and because of the one accord. However, I relied too much on our situation. When I objected to our brother&rsquo;s view concerning the ground, a few co-workers went beyond their measure. If the co-workers acknowledge that I am taking the lead here, then please allow me to say that since I was the one who invited Brother Sparks, I was responsible for the fellowship. When I objected to the fellowship, the co-workers should have stood with me. When I invited him, the co-workers accepted my invitation; when I objected to the fellowship, they should have stood with me and kept their bounds. If they are willing to stay within their measure, we can invite Brother Austin-Sparks to come again when our situation is stable.</p>
<p>Before that time we had the one accord and were in harmony. But problems arose after those years. The underlying cause of the problems is related to our brother&rsquo;s visit. I am responsible for inviting our brother, and I am responsible for raising objections to the fellowship. The co-workers are under my leading and should have stayed within their measure. They need to comprehend this word. The work has been under my leading for many years, but our brother&rsquo;s visit damaged the work because when there was a disagreement and I objected, the co-workers held differing opinions. Perhaps no evil was intended, but it caused us problems. It is as if the boat was capsized.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING A SERIOUS LESSON</h2>
<p>This fellowship is for us to learn a serious lesson. When Brother Nee was among us, we did things as he said they should be done, and whatever he spoke, we spoke; we did not have a second opinion. When he was taking the lead, it was his speaking that mattered; we just obeyed. Even if I did not see things as he did, I followed without questioning, and this brought the blessing. I invited Brother Austin-Sparks to come, and the co-workers accepted that invitation. I raised objections, but they held opinions that were contrary to mine. This was our problem. As a result, rumors arose, and the saints became confused; some even spoke of compromising and waiting to see if we would change our stand. There is no need to wait and see, and we do not compromise the truth. We only know to follow the truth.</p>
<p>If the co-workers want me to take the lead, then I will take the lead. Regardless of whether I was right or wrong in raising objections to our brother, I was responsible for our fellowship. The co-workers must learn to stay within their measure; otherwise, I cannot take the lead. The co-workers have solemnly indicated that they accept my leading and are willing to move forward. I hope that we have all learned this serious lesson.</p>
<p>This fellowship is necessary for the co-workers to be in harmony. My concern is that some may still disapprove. Therefore, I am begging the co-workers to stay within their bounds. If our situation were stable, we would have invited Brother Austin-Sparks to come a third time. However, we did not receive the help that we should have received from his last visit; instead, we brought unnecessary trouble upon ourselves. After the second visit, those who said that they were helped by Brother Austin-Sparks became factors of division. Receiving help is good, but it is wrong for someone to become a cause of division after receiving help. My heart grieves because of this. We love the Lord, and we belong to Him. Therefore, please consider these words.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING WITH PROPER DISCERNMENT</h2>
<p>We receive all the truth that God has recovered in the church throughout the ages, but we do not receive blindly; we receive with discernment. Just as we receive Madame Guyon&rsquo;s spirituality but not Catholicism and Andrew Murray&rsquo;s revelation but not denominational organization, we receive Brother Austin-Sparks&rsquo;s spirituality, but he must give us freedom concerning the practicality of the ground of the church. Otherwise, it will make things very difficult for us. Our situation shows that after our brother&rsquo;s visit, things have indeed been very difficult, and I regret this. If the co-workers had stayed within their measure, I would have no regrets. Unrest and chaotic situations have prevented us from advancing.</p>
<p>According to Brother Austin-Sparks, the building can take place anywhere as long as there is spiritual material; that is, as long as there is gold, silver, and precious stones that issue from Christ, the building can take place anywhere. This is not the truth that we see. Although gold, silver, and precious stones are the right materials, the building must take place on Mount Moriah. Any building not on Mount Moriah is wrong even if it is built with the same materials and according to the same pattern. Although we are in Christ and are of Christ, only building on the local ground is right; building on the ground of doctrine or practice is wrong, and building on the ground of the two or three gathered together is even more wrong. This is the truth in the Bible and our view.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I am displeased with what our brother said, but on the other hand, our fellowship did not cease. When I was in the United States, an experienced brother whom I had never met came to see me. He had a question regarding house churches. He had no problem with the local churches but asked how I explain the church in the house of Aquila and Prisca (1 Cor. 16:19). I pointed out that when Aquila and Prisca were in Ephesus, the church in Ephesus gathered in their house (Acts 18:18-19, 26) and that when they were in Rome, the church in Rome gathered in their house (Rom. 16:3, 5). After my explanation, he asked concerning my fellowship with Brother Austin-Sparks. I told him that even though Brother Austin-Sparks and I do not hold the same view concerning the ground, our fellowship had not ceased. Even though Paul was Peter&rsquo;s junior, when he saw that Peter was wrong, he opposed him to his face (Gal. 2:11). Even though Brother Austin-Sparks and I disagree concerning the ground, we have always maintained fellowship.</p>
<p>The ground of the church is very important. If we do not have the ground, why should we gather together? There are many Christian groups. What need is there to form more gatherings? There are many positive things in the Christian groups. We are not saying that we are spiritual by insisting on the ground. In many regards we cannot compare with other Christians. We gather outside the many Christian groups because of the ground. A person who wants to build a house must have a definite site on which to build. Likewise, besides having the right materials and pattern, there needs to be a definite ground in order to build the church. This is indicated in the Old Testament by the building site for the temple&mdash;the threshing floor of Ornan.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would have a clear vision concerning the building. If we fail in this point, we will commit a serious error. It is not a matter of having good or bad intentions or of doing something purposely or accidentally but a matter of committing a serious error. The work among us has suffered loss because of this. Hence, we need a clear vision to know what our attitude toward Brother Austin-Sparks should be. We need to be clear concerning what we should receive and hold fast. We need to know the pattern for the building, know what materials can be used, and know the ground for the building. If we are not definite regarding the ground, things will be difficult. If some hold differing opinions and cannot accept the truth concerning the ground, then we need to fellowship. Please do not pass on rumors that trouble the saints. I can lead only those who are one. I cannot lead those who give an uncertain sound of the trumpet (1 Cor. 14:8). This matter concerns the co-workers. May the Lord have mercy on us so that each of us will be clear.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH AND<br />
THE LOCAL CHURCHES</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER CHARACTER<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS SEEN IN THE MATERIALS<br />
OF THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>Acacia wood and fine linen are two materials that were used in the tabernacle. Both materials are from the plant life. In the Bible plants denote the humanity of Christ. In the tabernacle acacia wood denotes strength, and fine linen denotes fineness. Acacia wood signifies the Lord&rsquo;s strong humanity, and fine linen signifies His fine humanity. The strong acacia wood is the framework of the tabernacle for its standing and holding up (Exo. 26:15, 26, 32, 37). The fine linen is for covering (vv. 1, 31, 36; 27:9) and typifies the perfect and fine covering of love. Acacia wood speaks of a character that bears others. In the building of the tabernacle these two materials typify two character traits, both of which are indispensable in those who are being built up. It is good for a believer to possess both character traits. However, a believer often possesses only one. For example, Martin Luther&rsquo;s character was strong and unyielding like acacia wood. When the pope condemned him, he stood resolutely and was unyielding. But he might have lacked the fine linen. The Lord Jesus&rsquo; character possessed both the aspect of acacia wood and of fine linen. We need these two aspects in our character for the building of the church.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the standing boards of the tabernacle rest in sockets of silver (26:19). Silver signifies redemption; therefore, to rest in sockets of silver is to rest in the redemption of the Lord Jesus. The sockets of silver refer also to us. The fact that the supporting standing boards rest in sockets of silver indicates that those who are redeemed need to be worked on by God until they become the supporting strength of the tabernacle. These are some principles concerning building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GREAT LAMPSTAND AND THE LOCAL LAMPSTANDS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Lampstands Differing in Size, but<br />
Their Nature Being the Same</h2>
<p>Throughout the ages Christians have served God without the concept or vision of building. The purpose of preaching the gospel was to preach the gospel, and the purpose of teaching the Bible was to teach the Bible. However, the issue of our service should be the building. Revelation contains a vision of the ultimate, great lampstand&mdash;the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is a great lampstand. Verse 23 of chapter 21 says, &ldquo;The city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.&rdquo; The Lamb is the lamp of the city, and God is the light within the lamp, so the New Jerusalem is a great lampstand.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Revelation there are seven small lampstands, which are the seven churches (1:20). As a great lampstand, the New Jerusalem is the totality and aggregate of God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages. The beginning of Revelation speaks of the seven local churches which are in Asia (v. 4). Each local church is a golden lampstand. The lampstands being golden indicates that they are wholly of the divine nature. In nature the lampstands in chapter 1 are the same as the great lampstand in chapter 21. The only difference is their composition. A local lampstand refers to the church in a locality, which is composed of the saints in that locality, but the great lampstand includes all the believers in the church age and the twelve tribes of Israel, the redeemed in the Old Testament (21:14, 12). The difference between the lampstands in Revelation 1 and the lampstand in chapter 21 is a matter of composition; they are identical in nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building the Local Lampstands<br />
and Consummately the Great Lampstand</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages is for building the ultimate great lampstand. But we need to focus on the local church we are in as the lampstand that God wants to build. In the realm of eternity, as long as our service is out of God and of value to Him, it is a part of the great lampstand. However, in this age God&rsquo;s will is to build the saints in a locality into a lampstand in that locality. Christianity says that there is no need to care for local building, because as soon as a person is saved, he is material for the New Jerusalem. This understanding cares only for the great lampstand, not for the local lampstands, and is inadequate, because Revelation contains not only the great lampstand but also the local lampstands, which are lampstands in different localities. The great lampstand is the coming New Jerusalem, but the local lampstands are present today. The great lampstand is universal, but the local lampstands are in localities.</p>
<p>God wants us to build the local lampstands today. But the work done in Christianity disregards the local lampstands. The environment, atmosphere, view, and attitude in Christianity disregard the local lampstands. The apostles built lampstands in locality after locality. Peter did not build the great lampstand of the New Jerusalem directly, but he built the lampstand in Jerusalem in the land of Judea. The lampstands that we build will ultimately be incorporated into the great lampstand. The local lampstands are the constituents of the great lampstand; hence, the work of local lampstands is the work of the great lampstand. The view of building the great lampstand but neglecting the local lampstands is impractical. That is not God&rsquo;s will or His way; rather, it is man&rsquo;s way of avoiding difficulty. The work of the local lampstands is troublesome, but we should not avoid this difficulty or seek an easy way. It is easy to preach the gospel, bring people to salvation, teach the Bible, and hold retreats for individual spiritual edification. But if we want to build the church in a locality and bring the believers together for fellowship and coordination, we will encounter many problems. Therefore, it is easy to care for the coming New Jerusalem and disregard the building of the church in a locality; we avoid authority, order, and leading. The practice of merely telling people about Jesus and bringing them to salvation for the coming New Jerusalem is found in Christianity, but it is not according to God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Every aspect of the apostles&rsquo; work was for building up the local lampstands. Even though the Lord has the great lampstand as His ultimate goal, no Epistle was written to the great lampstand&mdash;the New Jerusalem. The Epistles were written to the small local lampstands in order to deal with their problems. The work of the apostles was for the local lampstands; the local lampstands were the object of their Epistles. The light concerning the local lampstands and the great lampstand is becoming brighter and clearer. We must be clear concerning our need to spend the time to labor on the local lampstands. If we do not know how to do the work of building up local lampstands, we should look at the model of the great lampstand. This model shows us how to serve in our locality. Our work must build the local lampstands, which ultimately become the great lampstand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOAL AND ATMOSPHERE OF BUILDING</h2>
<p>Let us now consider the relationship between gifts and building. According to Ephesians, the various gifts given by God are for the building (4:7, 11-12). We must note that the building depends not on what is done but on the goal and atmosphere. For example, building a house requires workmen with various skills, such as a mason, carpenter, and blacksmith. The mason builds the walls, the carpenter makes the doors, and the blacksmith forges metal. The work, gifts, and functions of the various workmen differ. But this is secondary in relation to building the house. The first and foremost matter is that the men have the same goal, which is to build the house. The goal of the blacksmith is to build the house, not to forge metal. Even though his work consists of forging metal, the purpose of his work is the building of the house. Likewise, the goal of the carpenter is to build the house, not to make doors. This also applies to the mason. Hence, although there are different kinds of workmen&mdash;some make doors, others forge metal, and still others lay walls&mdash;their goal is to build the house, and the atmosphere of their work is also to build the house.</p>
<p>Not all Christians work for the building; on the contrary, the work of some creates divisions. Some preach the gospel for the building, indicating that the building is the goal and atmosphere of their preaching the gospel. But when others preach the gospel, divisions are formed, indicating that divisions are the goal and atmosphere of their preaching the gospel. In the same principle, some Christians bring people to know Christ for the goal and atmosphere of building, but when others bring people to know Christ, their goal and atmosphere cause the building of the church to suffer loss.</p>
<p>Those who serve God must see the vision of the building. Until a Christian sees the vision of the building, the goal of his preaching the gospel is merely preaching the gospel, not building. After he sees the vision of the building, the goal and atmosphere of his work are for the building. His preaching the gospel is for the building. He preaches the gospel not merely to save people from the lake of fire but with the goal and atmosphere of building the house of God. Furthermore, the feeling of those who are saved through such gospel preaching is also the building.</p>
<p>Therefore, we emphasize the need to see the ultimate goal, the building up of the church. Perhaps a brother has the gift of an evangelist, another of a teacher, another of prophesying, another of managing the church, and yet another of healing. They can have different gifts, but their goal is the same. Just as different workmen have different functions, yet they all build one house, so our goal and atmosphere are for the building up of the church. The coordination of the various gifts is in the goal and atmosphere of building.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING THE CHURCH<br />
WITH THE RICHES OF CHRIST TO BE<br />
THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the building of the church from two aspects&mdash;the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ. The church is built with the riches of Christ to produce the fullness of Christ, and this fullness is the church. What is the difference between the riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8) and the fullness of Christ (1:23; 4:13)? Even those who are accustomed to hearing many spiritual terms often cannot differentiate between these terms, but the Bible differentiates between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RICHES OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Riches of Christ</h2>
<p>Concerning the riches of Christ, Ephesians 3:8 says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.&rdquo; <em>Unsearchable</em> in this verse also means &ldquo;inexhaustible&rdquo; and &ldquo;boundless.&rdquo; The apostle Paul said that he was particularly graced by the Lord to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable, inexhaustible, and boundless riches of Christ. He did not preach doctrine or teachings. He preached the unsearchable and boundless riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fullness of Christ</h2>
<p>The fullness of Christ is spoken of twice in Ephesians. The first time is in 1:22-23, which says, &ldquo;The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; These verses clearly say that the church is the Body of Christ and also the fullness of Christ. The Lord Christ is the One who fills all in all. Since He is so vast and rich, He needs a Body to be His fullness, and that Body is the church.</p>
<p>The fullness of Christ is spoken of a second time in 4:13, which says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; Verses 11 through 12 say that the Lord &ldquo;gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; A gift perfects the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the building up of the church, until the Body arrives at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. When we compare these verses with 1:22-23, we see that the church as the fullness of Christ should have a measure of full stature.</p>
<p>Another verse concerning the fullness of Christ is John 1:16: &ldquo;Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; <em>Fullness</em> is used three times in relation to Christ. John 1:16 says that we have all received of His fullness, Ephesians 1:22-23 says that the church as the Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ, and 4:13 says that we must arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fullness of God</h2>
<p>The Bible also speaks of the fullness of God. Ephesians 3:19 says, &ldquo;To know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; In verse 18 Paul says that the breadth and length and height and depth of Christ are unlimited, and in verse 19 he says that the love of Christ surpasses what the human mind can apprehend. We need to be filled with the unsearchably rich Christ unto the fullness of God.</p>
<p>There are two verses in Colossians that speak of the fullness of God. Verse 19 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;In Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell,&rdquo; and verse 9 of chapter 2 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; <em>Fullness</em> in these two verses refers to the fullness of God dwelling in Christ. The following verse, 2:10, says, &ldquo;You have been made full in Him.&rdquo; The Greek word translated as &ldquo;made full&rdquo; is not the same word as the word translated &ldquo;fullness&rdquo; in 1:19 and 2:9. The Greek word for &ldquo;made full&rdquo; implies completeness through fullness. Hence, we are made complete through Christ as the fullness. Because all the fullness dwells in Christ, after we have been put into Him, we are complete, made full, in Him.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the word <em>fullness</em> is used three times in relation to Christ (John 1:16; Eph. 1:23; 4:13) and three times in relation to God (Eph. 3:19; Col. 1:19; 2:9). The Greek word for &ldquo;riches&rdquo; in Ephesians 3:8 is different from the word for &ldquo;fullness.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">The Picture of the Ark and the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>The contents of the tabernacle can be used to illustrate the difference between riches and fullness. The Ark is inside the tabernacle, and the Ten Commandments given by God are inside the Ark. The Ark typifies Christ, and the Ten Commandments are the explanation and expression of God. According to typology, the Ten Commandments&rsquo; being inside the Ark indicates that everything God is, is in Christ, and this is the riches of Christ. God has put all that He is and has into Christ, and all that God is and has are the unlimited, boundless, and inexhaustible riches of Christ.</p>
<p>Moreover, the tabernacle is the enlargement of the Ark. The tabernacle is the fullness of the Ark. If we exchange the word <em>Ark</em> with <em>Christ,</em> then the tabernacle is the fullness of Christ. The Ten Commandments, which are hidden inside the Ark, are the riches of the Ark, and the tabernacle as the enlargement of the Ark is the fullness of the Ark. When the Ark arrived at the house of Obed-edom (2 Sam. 6:11), there was no problem with the riches of the Ark because the Ten Commandments were inside the Ark. However, there was a problem with the fullness of the Ark because there was no tabernacle. The Ark is made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, and the tabernacle is also made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. Therefore, the enlargement of the Ark is the tabernacle, and the tabernacle is the fullness of the Ark. This picture shows that the riches of the Ark are the Ten Commandments within the Ark. However, if the Ark has merely the Ten Commandments but no tabernacle, it would merely have the riches but no fullness. The issue of the Ark is the tabernacle, just as the issue of Adam is Eve. Eve is not the riches of Adam but the fullness of Adam. This means that Eve is the enlargement of Adam. From this picture we can say that what is within Christ is the riches of Christ and that by entering into us, Christ has been expanded, making us His one Body, His tabernacle, and His counterpart, as His fullness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING THE CHURCH WITH THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In Ephesians Paul says that he announced the riches of Christ (3:8) so that those who receive the riches of Christ would become the fullness of Christ (1:23). The fullness of Christ is the church. There have never been any problems with the riches of Christ, but there can be problems with the fullness of Christ. If the church has problems, the fullness of Christ has problems. In the Old Testament, when the tabernacle had problems, lost its position, or was damaged, the fullness of the Ark had problems. When the tabernacle had problems, the Ark possessed only riches; it lost its fullness. In order for Christ to have a fullness, the church must be built up. This is a great matter. We need to see that we announce the riches of Christ. What we announce as the gospel is the riches of Christ, and the issue of our announcing the riches of Christ is the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4 Paul says that the gifts are for the perfecting of the saints unto the building up of the Body of Christ so that we all may arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ emphasizes the church becoming a full-grown man. Verse 13 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>at</em> occurs three times, but it refers to the same thing. When we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, we arrive at a full-grown man, which also is our arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. We must note that Ephesians does not speak of individuals but of a corporate entity. The new man in 2:15 and the dwelling place of God in verse 22 are corporate, not individual, and the warfare in chapter 6 is by a corporate entity, not an individual. The work of the apostles is to perfect the saints unto the building up of the Body of Christ so that the church can mature until it is full-grown. Then the church will have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 says that the fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ (v. 23). By the time we come to chapter 4, the fullness of Christ refers not merely to the Body of Christ but to the Body of Christ having a full stature. Our work is to announce the riches of Christ to men and to perfect them with the riches of Christ so that they become the fullness of Christ; that is, they become the church. This means that we are bringing out the riches of the Ark to build the tabernacle.</p>
<p>The Ark in the Old Testament was not empty; it was rich in its contents. Inside the Ark are the riches, and when the Ark is enlarged into the tabernacle, the tabernacle becomes the fullness of the Ark. This is a type of Christ. The Ark typifies Christ, and the tabernacle typifies the fullness of Christ. All that God is, is in Christ (John 14:10). When the riches of Christ are ministered, Christ expands into us, and we become His Body, the church. Hence, the church is the fullness of Christ. Christ is the embodiment of God, and the church is the expression of Christ. Within Christ are the riches, and the enlargement of Christ is the fullness. This is the blueprint, and our work is to build according to this blueprint. We announce and minister the riches of Christ. As a result, we use the riches of Christ to make men the fullness of Christ, that is, the church as the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE BODY AND COUNTERPART OF CHRIST<br />
TO EXPRESS THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1 says that the church is the Body of Christ and that the Body is the fullness of Christ (vv. 22-23). If a brother stands up, and I cover his body so that people can see only his head, his fullness will not be expressed, because his body is his fullness. Once his body is covered, his fullness is not expressed. The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all. The church is the Body of Christ and also His fullness. When we touch the riches of Christ, there is an issue, and that issue is the producing of the church. Without the church, Christ has no fullness; and without the church, Christ has only a head but no body. Without the church, Christ has no counterpart. He is like an Adam without an Eve.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2:18 God said, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart&rdquo; In verses 21 and 22 God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and He took one of his ribs and built the rib, which He had taken from the man, into a woman. God did not create another human being apart from Adam. Rather, God built the rib that He had taken from Adam into Eve. Hence, Eve is the enlargement of Adam to be his counterpart and to become his fullness. Likewise, although the Ark is complete in itself, without the tabernacle the fullness of the Ark is not seen; without the tabernacle the Ark has no expression. Christ is complete in Himself and has God as His rich content, but without the church, without His counterpart, He does not have an expression of fullness. God is doing one work in the universe, which is to gain an organic entity to match His Son. This work is to produce the fullness of His Son so that the riches of His Son may be expressed. Just as the tabernacle matches the Ark, and Eve matches Adam, so the church must match Christ. There must be a Body that matches the Head. Only in this way can the fullness of Christ be expressed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Body of Christ<br />
Being the Enlargement of Christ</h2>
<p>God wants to build the church, the Body of Christ, and this Body is the enlargement of Christ. We need to understand these two points: our work is to dispense the riches of Christ into the saints, and we allow these riches to build the Body in order for Christ to have an enlarged expression. The riches become the enlargement of Christ. When He is enlarged, we are built together with others to be His one Body, the fullness of Christ. The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, as the Body of Christ, is not produced instantaneously; it comes through growth over a period of time. When a child grows gradually into a full-grown man, he obtains the measure of the stature of a full-grown man. Likewise, we must let Christ grow in us until we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This is the measure of the stature that the church should possess. We are building a living temple, not a dead house. Hence, Ephesians 2:21 says, &ldquo;In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.&rdquo; <em>Growing</em> here indicates that the church as the dwelling place of God is living and able to grow.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Members One of Another<br />
and Being Delivered from an Individual Work</h2>
<p>The more we touch the riches of Christ, the more we should be for the church. The more we know the fullness of Christ, the more we will see that this fullness is not for an individual, because an individual cannot become the fullness of Christ. Only the church is the fullness of Christ. If only one of my hands could move, work, and walk, I would look very clumsy, and I would not have an expression of fullness. The fullness of Christ depends on the measure of the full-grown stature. In order to be one Body with the fullness of Christ, we need to be members one of another. If we see this, we will not be able to do an individual work, and we will fully know God&rsquo;s will. According to His will, God was incarnated in the Son to express His riches, and the Son passed through death, resurrection, and ascension to become the life-giving Spirit. Now as the Spirit He gives gifts who announce His riches to men. The receivers of the riches are perfected and built up with the riches into a Body, a dwelling place, a tabernacle, and a temple to be the glorious fullness of God in this universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living in the Riches of Christ<br />
and Not Making Divisions</h2>
<p>If the church were not divided and had no problems and the believers lived in the riches of the Son of God as His Body, then the fullness of the Son of God would be expressed on the earth today. If this normal situation were expressed, the whole earth would express the glorious fullness of Christ. There is no problem with Christ the Head, but there are many problems with the Body: it is divided and scattered. There can never be any problems with the riches of Christ, but the fullness of Christ is continually being attacked. Some who enjoy the riches of Christ annul the fullness of Christ. Others possess the riches of Christ but destroy the fullness of Christ. This is the desolate condition of the church. The Lord has had mercy on us, and by His sovereignty we are in His recovery. What we are doing today is recovering the fullness and recovering the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fullness of Christ Being<br />
the Expression of the Riches in Christ</h2>
<p>Some brothers may ask why John 1:16 says, &ldquo;Of His fullness we have all received&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Of His riches we have all received.&rdquo; This is not a contradiction; the riches and the fullness are actually one thing. Within Christ are the riches, but once the riches are received by us, they become the fullness of Christ. The riches in Christ are hidden, but when the riches are expressed in us, they become the fullness. The riches are in Christ, but when the riches are expressed in us, they are the fullness. Similarly, the riches in God are expressed in Christ as the fullness. Hence, Colossians 2:9 says that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. What is in Christ is His riches, but when we receive the riches of Christ, they become the fullness to us.</p>
<p>God is the source of the riches. When the riches of God are in Christ, Christ becomes the fullness of God. All the riches of God are in Christ. In Christ they are the riches; when the riches are received by us, we become the fullness of Christ. Therefore, Christ is the fullness of God, and the church is the fullness of Christ. God is doing one work in the universe. He is working Himself in His Son into us so that we become a corporate entity, His dwelling place, in which He has a full expression.</p>
<p>This is the significance of the Ark and the tabernacle in the Old Testament. The Ten Commandments are in the Ark, and the Ark is in the tabernacle. This is also portrayed by the New Jerusalem in Revelation&mdash;God as light is in the Lamb as the lamp, and the lamp is in the holy city (21:23). The lamp is the fullness of the light, the holy city is the fullness of the lamp, and the light that is expressed and shined forth is God. God is glorified in His Son, and the Son is glorified through the built-up church. We are building the church with the riches of Christ to produce the fullness of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GENUINE BUILDING<br />
DEPENDING ON THE BLENDING<br />
OF EVERY MEMBER&rsquo;S SPIRIT</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BLENDING OF EVERY MEMBER&rsquo;S SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Whether the church can be genuinely built up depends on whether the brothers in a coordinated service have the reality of the building. The saints have seen a vision of the building and have a heart to build the church. However, genuine building takes place when our spirits are blended together. Genuine building is not the ability to get along with others. That is superficial; it is not deep enough. Genuine building must be the blending of every member into one spirit and in one spirit. Only in this way are we saved from individual spirituality. The ability to be blended with others&rsquo; spirits is a real indication of not having individual spirituality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES IN ACTS</h2>
<p>Acts 1:14-15 says, &ldquo;These all continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers. And in those days...there was a group of persons gathered together, about a hundred and twenty.&rdquo; Before the Holy Spirit was poured out on the disciples on the day of Pentecost, a hundred and twenty gathered together and prayed in one accord for ten days. During those ten days the disciples must have had individual prayer, but they probably had more prayer together than individually, because verse 14 says that they &ldquo;continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer.&rdquo; The disciples must have been blended in their spirit because they prayed persistently in one accord. They prayed for the same goal, the fulfillment of the promise of the Father. In verse 4 the Lord charged the disciples &ldquo;not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father,&rdquo; and in verse 8, concerning the promise, He said, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; The disciples prayed together for ten days for this goal, and their praying together caused their spirits to be blended together and also caused them to be blended in the same goal.</p>
<p>Acts 13:1-2 says, &ldquo;Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo; According to these verses, in Antioch there were five prophets and teachers who ministered to God in one accord. <em>Ministering</em> does not refer to the work they did or the things they accomplished but to their fasting and praying. In their ministering, the spirit of each one came forth, and thus their spirits were mingled into one in God&rsquo;s Spirit.</p>
<p>Because the hundred and twenty were blended and built together before Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost, and three thousand were saved when Peter stood with the eleven and preached the gospel (2:1-4, 14, 41). Because five prophets and teachers in Antioch were blended and built with one another through their ministering to the Lord, the Holy Spirit was able to speak concerning His need (13:1-4). The five were one in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVING ONES FIRST NEEDING<br />
TO COME TOGETHER TO PRAY</h2>
<p>When the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones see this vision and desire to build the church according to the vision of this blueprint, the first thing that they need to do is pray and be blended together through prayer. Therefore, in the service meetings we should open our spirit in order to be blended with the spirits of the saints. Coming to the service meetings in order to discuss the service is not a proper view. When we see the vision of the building, we will bear the commission of this vision on our shoulders, but this is more than we can bear in ourselves. Therefore, when we come to the service meetings, we must open our spirit and bear the burden of the service together in prayer. We do not come to hold a meeting, to hear someone give a message, or to consider different situations. We come together to open our spirit and pray with the same burden before God, with a burden for the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE COMMISSION<br />
AND SERVING TOGETHER THROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>Those who have truly seen this vision and are under this vision bear a burden when they are in the service meeting. They pray on their way to the meeting, and they pray in the meeting. They know that they cannot bear the responsibility as individuals and that every member is needed to bear the responsibility. Therefore, the service meetings should be filled with prayer. No matter when a brother arrives, he should start praying. As soon as another brother arrives, he should join the prayer. Then the meeting will begin with everyone praying together. It is not necessary to wait thirty minutes before choosing a hymn. When the prayer comes to a pause, a hymn can be sung. We should not have formality in our service meeting or in any meeting. Everyone should come to the service meeting with a released spirit in order to bear a common burden. This is genuine service.</p>
<p>This should also be the situation in the prayer meeting. We do not gather to have a prayer meeting, but we are praying when we arrive at the meeting. We should not sit and wait thirty minutes for the saints to arrive before we begin praying. Rather, prayer in the meetings is spontaneous, and it is prayer in spirit.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting for a saint to propose, inspire, or initiate something in the meetings, we only need to release our spirit and bear the burden together according to the inspiration we receive from the Lord and the vision we have seen. Our service is to pray for the vision of God&rsquo;s building in the situation of the church and to pray to see the vision in our situations. We have not practiced this enough. The service meeting may be only once a week, but we should bear this burden in our spirit when we come together. If once a week is not enough, we should come together and pray every time there is an opportunity so that our spirits are blended together to bear the Lord&rsquo;s commission. Otherwise, there is no need to have service meetings. We must drop the rituals and formalities in the meetings and pray as soon as we come to the meetings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a brother who has seen the vision will be pressed by the vision to pray continually with other serving ones until they have thoroughly prayed concerning the vision. If there are several co-workers serving together, they should spend ten days together in order to pray. Perhaps they should pray with fasting on one of the days in order to be blended in prayer until one matter has been thoroughly prayed over and prayed through. Then those coordinating together will be blended in this matter, and they can go out to do the work of building. We should not think that seeing the blueprint qualifies us to go out and work. Seeing the blueprint without being blended with our co-workers can cause problems. We cannot simply take the blueprint and build. Those who build must first pray thoroughly and be blended with one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BE BLENDED INTO ONE</h2>
<p>Even though we have different functions and different services, we must be in one spirit, in one feeling, and in one mind (Phil. 2:2). Prayer is the means to reach this condition. In the past we lacked this kind of necessary and indispensable prayer. We excelled in administration and arrangement but lacked prayer and fellowship. From this day forward every aspect of the work must begin with prayer. If we do not take this way, we have no way to carry out the work. We are not speaking of common prayer, that is, prayer that asks God to do things. Instead, the serving ones need to come together and pray themselves into the Holy Spirit so that God can work. We must believe that God will work. Our need is to pray with an open spirit. The serving ones should join together in spirit and pray for practical building step by step. This must be our practice.</p></body></html>
