   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ASSURING THEM THAT THEY ARE SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY CALLING ON THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After they pray, you must have the boldness to assure them with a verse that they are saved, and the best verse is Romans 10:13 Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to give them this verse and assure them with this verse that they have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not ask them if they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you ask them, they would probably say that they do not think, believe, or feel that they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Your responsibility is to assure them that they have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let them read Romans 10:13.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>DIRECTING THEM TO BE BAPTIZED</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then read to them Mark 16:16 which says, He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After they pray and have been given the assurance that the Lord Jesus lives in them, you need to say, Let us be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not ask them if they would like to be baptized because you would receive no for an answer most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why I say to direct them to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to our experience in Taipei, by using these principles the saints were successful eighty percent of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Generally, your contacts will follow your directions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may be speaking to the husband of a family concerning getting baptized, and at the same time direct the wife to fill up the bathtub with water before he has even decided.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes the wife would even tell the husband to be baptized even though she has not yet decided to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Taipei the saints always went out in groups of three or four.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While two or three would be baptizing the husband, a sister would be fellowshipping with the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the husband was baptized, then she would say to the wife, Let us be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Most followed this direction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may be concerned about bringing in some false ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But you must realize that at the beginning everyone seems to be false.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After you preach the gospel to a person, after he believes and is baptized, and after some prayer, this false one becomes a real believer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is now one with you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>TAKING THE CHANCE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THEM</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FOR THE NEXT MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After you direct someone to be baptized, take the chance to make an appointment with them for the next meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not ask them if you can meet with them again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This gives them the ground to refuse you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You need to talk with them to induce them to meet with you again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times they would ask you if you would come back again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Take this opportunity to make an appointment with them that fits in with their time schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you visit them the next time, you will present more truths and they will get more help.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, you can take the opportunity to make appointments for regular meetings in their homes weekly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some of the homes that you visit will have already been prepared by the Lord just as the Lord prepared the house of Cornelius Acts 10:17-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Peter went to Cornelius s house, everything was ready.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From the time that you knock on the door until you make an appointment for another meeting should take about twenty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>KNOCKING ON DOORS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I would propose to all the churches that the leading ones should take the lead to practice this, to get some experience either in some homes or in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then based upon what you have learned in this practice, go out strictly according to all these instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I believe that you will close many deals.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Go and do it!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We expect all the full-time trainees to go out every day to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are also expecting them to baptize one person a week as a result of this labor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fifty door knockers will bring in two thousand six hundred yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you do not practice what I am fellowshipping with you, this may seem like a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if you practice this, it is not a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Twenty full-timers who knock on doors every day of the week should bring in about one thousand a year.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After my study and investigation, I have the full assurance that this is workable.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Ten full-timers could bring in forty every month and four hundred eighty new ones in an entire year.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is worthwhile for some to drop their jobs to be the door knockers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I would also like to say a word to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not merely be an elder in the church service office.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Go out to knock on the doors.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a full-time elder would take my word to knock on doors every day, he could bring in fifty-two a year.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose you would go seven days a week for about two hours every day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Within these two hours you could knock on at least ten doors.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Out of these ten doors perhaps five will open to you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means thirty-five doors will be opened to you per week.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Out of these thirty-five, you can surely baptize one.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must admit that in the past we had the wrong way, so we wasted much of our time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We had big gatherings for gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We labored much and invited people to gospel feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When someone came to our feast, this was a great gift to us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We were so grateful that they came, but eventually they disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There was not much increase in the past due to our way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Again I say, if you drop your job to go knock on people s doors for one year, you will bring in fifty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I am hoping that in 1987 we will have five hundred full-time workers in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>With each one of these full-time workers knocking on doors for two hours each day, seven days a week, within one year we can have an increase of over twenty-five thousand in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need the persons, and we need the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What I am fellowshipping with you is the right way to practice to get the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May we all go to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Not everyone can drop their job, but everyone should be able to go out two hours a week.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Seven weeks of this kind of labor equals one full week of a full-time worker s labor.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Through this kind of labor, you could bring in at least one every seven weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This amounts to a brother bringing in seven every year.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you went out two hours every week, every year you could bring in seven.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This means that the churches will have a sevenfold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If there were one hundred saints in your locality willing to practice this, you could have seven hundred new ones after one year.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>With the money-making full-timers there could be a sevenfold increase, and with the job-dropping full-timers we could have a fifty-two fold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As a conclusion to our fellowship in this chapter, it would be good to sing Hymns, 473.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We all need to take the charge in stanza three of this hymn to rise up and strike the holy bargain the fragment for the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>All things are yours when you are His, and He and you are one.</S>
