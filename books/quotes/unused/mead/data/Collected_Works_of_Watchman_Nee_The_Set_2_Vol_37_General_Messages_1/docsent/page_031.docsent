   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECEIVING OF THE LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, we have God's speaking, His shining, or His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God spoke to Moses from the midst of the two cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the matter of fellowship, God stressed the fact that fellowship and communion with Moses was based on the mercy seat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, He has no intention that we forget the cherubim; He has no intention that we forget His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His shining, God spoke with Moses from the midst of the two cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His emphasis is on His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If man can fellowship with Him upon the mercy seat, he is able to hear God's word from the midst of the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, God has no intention that we forget the mercy seat either.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God spoke to Moses from the midst of the two cherubim; He led His children according to His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Wherever God's glory resides, there is His leading also.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's leading came in the form of the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through the pillar of cloud, man sees God's glory, and through the pillar of fire, man also sees God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The place of God's glory is the place of His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God speaks and leads according to His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God speaks to us personally concerning a certain matter, that is the time we know that we are glorifying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we see God's glory in a certain matter, we know that we have His leading in that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With many of God's children, leading and glory are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But before God, glorifying God and being led by God are not two things but one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Wherever we find God's glory, we find His leading concerning certain matters for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As soon as we see God's glory, we know that we are in the right place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God spoke from the midst of the two cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All those who have seen God's glory have heard His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not have to see His glory first and then wait for His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once we see God's glory in the way of life, this seeing will give us a more profound knowledge than we previously had.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we see God's glory, we understand and know.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is right?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is the right way?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the wrong way?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What has spiritual value, and what does not have spiritual value?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It all depends on whether or not God's glory is there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some matters may be small and may not be worth much in man's eyes, but the minute you touch it, you know that you have touched God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once you touch God's glory, you know that you have the leading, and there is no need to wait for more leading.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With some work, the more you engage yourself in it, the more you feel that it is cheap and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With some other work, the more you engage yourself in it, the more shining you become, and the more light there is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You feel that such work is worthwhile and right.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not a question of a great or a small work but a question of whether or not God's glory is there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If God's glory is not there, it is worthless; if God's glory is there, it is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Moses preached God's word, he became a minister of the word in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He ministered to God's people with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the words which God spoke to Moses and which He commanded Moses to convey to the Israelites were given to him from the midst of the two cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, when Moses spoke for God, he touched the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the same way, if we touch the glory of God and see His glory, we will have something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes we feel very good about what we have said, and the arguments seem sound.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet we feel that it is very superficial and shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no testimony of the word in our speaking, and there is no ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a matter is of God, we will immediately sense that it comes from the midst of the two cherubim and will know that the glory of God is there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's glory is not only something objective but something among us and something we can know.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many times in our daily life, we touch the glory of God, and we find that there is something that glorifies God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a glory becomes our leading.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In our work we often touch the glory of God; we find glory in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At these times we can say that the glory brings us the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we touch the glory of God while we are ministering a word to the church, we know that we have ministered God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every time we receive a revelation from God, we touch the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When God speaks from the midst of the two cherubim, we do not merely have words, but we have glory as well.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever we have only words without glory, we know that we only have doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever there are words as well as glory, we know that we have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is strange that every time we see God's glory, our mouth may not be able to articulate it, but we know it deep within us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If anyone asks us how we see, we may not be able to tell him, but the result of the seeing is there.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The greatest manifestation of glory is for us to prostrate ourselves on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we prostrate ourselves on the ground, we do not know what has happened, yet we know that we have touched God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The basis of our fellowship with God and of receiving light from Him is this touch of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we do not have this basis, everything we have is just doctrine and theory.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>May the Lord be gracious to us, so that day by day as we live on earth, we may touch God's glory.</S>
