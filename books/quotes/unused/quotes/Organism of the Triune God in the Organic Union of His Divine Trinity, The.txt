We need to see that the church as the Body of Christ is altogether organic, absolutely of life, with nothing organizational
A person is a living, moving, functioning organism, unlike a robot, which is an organization of inorganic parts
History tells us that nothing kills, damages, and annuls the reality of the church as much as organization does
We must realize, however, that the elders are appointed according to the manifestation of the measure of their growth in the divine life
In the Lord's recovery, according to the New Testament, the appointment of the elders is absolutely according to the growth in life
The elders in the churches are appointed according to the manifestation of the measure of their growth in the divine life
The church as God's farm, God's cultivated land, is something totally of life, having nothing to do with organization
The divine life is the basic and unique factor of all the building materials of this spiritual building, God's house
The overflow of the water is the fullness of the water, and the fullness of the water is the expression of the water that is inside the cup
For God to impart His life into us that we may share His life is His dispensing, and this dispensing is an issuing
According to the actual grammatical construction, God chose us by the marvelous way of predestinating us, or marking us out
God chose us with the intent that we would be born of Him to share His life and to participate in His holy nature
In Christ's redemption, fallen mankind gets recovered and brought back to the headship of Christ for the eternal dispensation of God
Christ died on the cross to redeem us back from a place of confusion, recovering us back to the headship of Christ
Christ's redemption not only recovers us back to His headship but also makes us God's inheritance for God's enjoyment
On the one hand, His all-inclusive death is the redeeming death, the death that redeemed us back to God and back to the headship of Christ
Christ died on the cross as the brass serpent to judge and to destroy the source of sin and the authority of death, the Devil, Satan
After He imparted His divine life into us through His death plus His resurrection, He made us an inheritance to God
In Christ's redemption God has been imparted into us, the Christ-redeemed ones, making us a particular possession for God
The Triune God in the Son has been dispensed, imparted, into our being, making us an inheritance of God for God to be satisfied
There is such a divine flow in this universe, and this flow has been consummated, or completed, by the flowing Spirit
When a seal is placed on a sheet of paper, the ink essence in the form, the likeness, of the seal is applied to the paper and saturates it
As we continue to call on the Lord, we continue to be sealed by the indwelling Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God
After sealing us, this seal becomes a pledge of God to the sealed ones, guaranteeing that God is their inheritance for their satisfaction
In Christ we were made an inheritance of God, and under the sealing of the Spirit, we enjoy God as the pledge of our inheritance
The dispensing of the divine Trinity to produce the organism of the Triune God is accomplished by the transmission of the great power of God
The transmission of this great, divine power to the church makes it the Body of Christ, an organism of the Triune God
The church is the issue of the operating Triune God, and this issue becomes the organism of the invisible Triune God
The local churches as the expression of the one Body of Christ should have nothing to do with organization but should be totally organic
The very salvation which we have received and which is being experienced by us day by day is in the organic union of the divine Trinity
When we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, we have a sweet feeling within us because something transpires within us
By calling 'O Lord Jesus,' our former history ended because our old history was terminated and buried in the tomb, and a new history began
In the sixties, some hippies were saved among us and we saw a great change take place in them because of their organic union with the Lord
Calling 'O Lord Jesus' terminated their former history, the history of a hippie, and began another history, the history of a saved person
As persons who had believed into Christ, they were persons in Christ, identified with Christ, which means that they became Christ
Many Christians think that this merely means that we were not saved by our work but by His redemption, His grace
Many Christians are expecting to go to heaven, but they do not realize that they were in the heavenlies already
We are still persons living and moving on this earth, but many times we have the deep sensation that we are in the heavenlies
We are transcendent because we are people in the heavenlies in the organic union in Christ through His death, resurrection, and ascension
The Spirit within us is the Triune God because the Spirit is the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father
He is now a God of divinity of humanity of incarnation of an allinclusive death and of a wonderful excellent transcendent resurrection
The name of our God is Jesus Christ, and when we called upon Him, the Spirit as the processed God came into us
The Spirit is the processed God and the compound Spirit that has been compounded with divinity humanity incarnation death and resurrection
Such a divine title had never been mentioned until this time because the Trinity of the Godhead had not been consummated
The Trinity was not consummated until the Triune God had passed through the processes of incarnation, death, and resurrection
The divine Trinity has been consummated in the processed Spirit, so the processed Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God
When the Spirit works in us, He works with all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained
To become a man through the divine conception, He had to be conceived in the womb of a virgin and remain there for nine months
Now in the universe there is a particular man, a special man, a man with two natures-the divine nature and the human nature
What a wonder it was for the Lord Jesus to live for thirty years in a poor carpenter's home and to live in the despised town of Nazareth!
The infinite, eternal, unlimited God was in that despised town doing the work of a carpenter, fully limited by time and space
The New Testament tells us that He needed to pass through human living to experience its sufferings, trials, and temptations
In His all-inclusive death, He solved and settled all the problems in the entire universe, including the problem of Satan
Peter 1:3 says that God the Father regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead
In His ascension He was made both Lord and Christ and became the Head over all things and the Head of the church
Christ's accomplishments include His creation of the universe and His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
One man was obtained by Him in His incarnation, but eventually He obtained a people through His death and resurrection
The totality of all His obtaining and attaining is the church in this age and the New Jerusalem in the coming age and for eternity
Now the working Spirit uses what the Triune God has obtained and attained to build us up firstly as the church and then as the New Jerusalem
The Spirit today works with all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained
The regenerating Spirit regenerates Christ's redeemed ones with the death, resurrection, and the divine life of Christ
To install electricity into a building, there is the need of a long wire to connect the power plant to the building
The preaching of the gospel was the practical installation of the wires within us, in our mind, emotion, will, and conscience
Sometimes this indwelling One is comforting, enlightening, and refreshing, but many times He is very troublesome to us
The New Testament reveals that sanctification is not only to separate us unto God but also to change our nature with the holy nature of God
The Spirit uses the elements of all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained to sanctify us
He desires to constitute us with these elements, to make these elements our elements for our spiritual and divine constitution
The entire constitution of our spiritual being is a kind of organic union, and this organic union is of the divine Trinity
We were separate individuals, but after being baptized in the one Spirit, we became a corporate Body, the Body of Christ
The issue of the work of the Spirit is also that all the Spirit-baptized believers are drinking of the same one Spirit
Such a reaction is a sign that our service to the Lord in the church life is by our natural life and not in the organic union
We have to know the difference between the 'vinegar' of our natural life and the 'sugar' of the divine life in the organic union
Are we serving the Lord in the church life in the organic union, in our American culture, or according to Chinese ethics?
In Ephesians 3 Paul prays that we may be able to apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth with all the saints
Thank the Lord that in His salvation we can experience this organic union which is wrapped up with the Spirit as the person
In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul said that the church was God's farm and that he planted and Apollos watered, but God made to grow
When we stay together in the church life, it is easy for us to experience some friction with others and be offended
The joints in the Body of Christ are the gifted persons listed in Ephesians 411the apostles prophets evangelists and shepherds and teachers
The building up of the Body is not only through the rich supply of the joints, who are the 'giants,' but also through all the small members
To meet according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 gives all the members the chance to practice and to develop their function
Functioning is not only in the meetings but also in taking care of the young ones and shepherding the new ones
The fullness of Christ is the expression of Christ; this expression has a stature, and this stature has a measure
The Spirit works with all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained
By the Triune God's incarnation through His ascension, He has accomplished everything that He intended to accomplish
The first item of the organic processes in the Spirit is our baptism into the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God
To understand the truth concerning baptism, we have to take care of all the related verses in the New Testament
We need to tell the ones whom we are baptizing that we are putting them into the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God
It was not until the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead that the title the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit was mentioned
At the time of Matthew 28:19, the Triune God had the human nature, and He was qualified with the experience of human living
Death with the resurrected Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God is excellent, marvelous, and lovable
At the time He charged the disciples to baptize others into the Triune God, He had also entered into His glorious resurrection
When the Lord Jesus, the embodiment of the Triune God, was telling His disciples to go to disciple the nations, He was in resurrection
We have seen that God was incarnated to be a man and that this God-man walked on this earth, living a human life for over thirty years
The resurrected and ascended Christ as the Head of the church has already baptized all His believing members into the consummated God
In these two steps all genuine believers in Christ have been baptized in the Holy Spirit into one Body once for all universally
Based upon this, the disciples baptized the new converts not only visibly into water but also invisibly into the Spirit
The baptizing ones and the baptized ones are saying amen to the fact that the believers have been put into the Triune God
Baptism puts us into the consummated Triune God, and regeneration puts the embodiment of the consummated God into us
At the time that we believed into Jesus and we were baptized into the consummated God, we got into Him and He got into us
Another organic process in the Spirit that we experience is that we are sealed with the Spirit as the essence of God
The Spirit's sealing us is to transfuse all that God is into our being, to saturate our being with the very essence of God
Now we have the very indwelling presence of the consummated God remaining in our being so that we can enjoy Him
The firstfruit means the first taste, and our enjoying of the first taste indicates that the full taste is coming
We are now in the stage of enjoying the firstfruit, which is the fresh Spirit, the fresh consummated Triune God
When the Triune God was consummated, He became the firstfruit to us, and now we are enjoying the fresh consummated God
Although it grows in a marsh, it is able to shoot up into the air, signifying the rising up of the Lord Jesus from the place of death
Cassia was used as a repellent to drive away snakes and insects and signifies the power, the effectiveness of Christ's resurrection
The middle unit of five hundred is split in two, signifying that the Son, the second of the divine Trinity, was split on the cross
The more that the compound Spirit anoints us, the more that the essence and element of God is painted into our being
When the Spirit as the compound ointment is being painted into us, we are becoming more organically united with the processed Triune God
If the anointing is not there when you open to the Lord concerning a certain brother or sister then that one is not the one you should marry
Even the decisions that we think are wrong were made under the sovereignty of God and will work for our good, our transformation
In Acts 13 Barnabas and Paul were sent for the preaching of the gospel and the establishing of the local churches
In the previous chapter, we saw nine of the organic processes in the Spirit experienced by the members of the Body of Christ
The last item that we saw in the previous chapter was that we need to be led by the Spirit of the divine sonship
Paul said that he had been crucified with Christ and that it was no longer he who lived but Christ lived in him
Regardless of how good something is that we do, if the consummated Triune God is not doing it through us, it is not acceptable to Him
If we had the attitude that the Epistles were written only to those to whom they were addressed, then none of the Epistles would be for us
It is clear that any book written in the New Testament was written to all the saints through all the generations
He is answering Paul by granting you, giving you mercy, to be strengthened through His Spirit, the consummated Spirit, into the inner man
Paul could withstand imprisonment and magnify Christ by living Him because he was fully supplied by the bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ
Another organic process in the Spirit experienced by us is that we are being renewed by the regenerating Spirit
Whether you feel high or low, up or down, strengthened or disappointed and discouraged, you are undergoing a renewing process
You may be like a marble Mary in front of some Catholic cathedrals who never weeps or laughs because she is a statue not a living Christian
When you recall your falling down, you may feel ashamed, but you will have a deeper sensation that you experienced much renewing
As long as we are being renewed and sanctified by the Spirit, we are also being transformed by the Spirit as the Lord in resurrection
In 2 Corinthians 3:17 the Lord is called the Spirit, and in verse 18 there is a compound holy title-'the Lord Spirit'
The seven Spirits being the seven eyes of the Lamb means that God is searching us and transfusing us with all that He is
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
The processed Triune God and the transformed, tripartite man are a universal couple that match each other in every way
The Triune God has been fully processed, and by the time of His coming back, a group of overcoming saints will have been fully transformed
The conclusion of the entire revelation concerning God in the Bible is that He is now the Spirit, the consummated Triune God
When the Bible says 'the Spirit' in Revelation 22:17, it is referring to the consummated Triune God who is the Bridegroom
You may have preached the gospel out of your love for man but you must confess that you have not been that organic living active and capable
These saints had a heart for the gospel, but they did not have the capability to talk to people concerning the gospel
You may be taking care of someone, yet you do not know how to help him because you have not been organic, living, active, and capable
If our children were the only ones who were gained for the Lords recovery we would still increase but our rate of increase has been too low
These small groups were to come together during the week for fellowship, and certain ones were assigned to be leaders of these small groups
Ephesians 4:11 and 12 say that the gifted ones perfect the saints to do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ
Verse 16 says that the Body will build up itself through the joints of the supply and through the operation in measure of each one part
Because we have received the help, we will know how to talk about Jesus with the unbelievers and how to take care of the young ones
Because we have a living and an organic Christian life and church life, we will be capable of helping others in a small group meeting
When the whole church comes together, everyone will have something to say according to the truth revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26
