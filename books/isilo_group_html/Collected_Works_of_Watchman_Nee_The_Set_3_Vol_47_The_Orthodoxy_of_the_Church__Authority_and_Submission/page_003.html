The Orthodoxy of the Church is based on a Bible study conducted by Watchman Nee during the period between 1942 and 1948. This section of Volume 47 has been previously published as a separate title.</p><p>Authority and Submission, based on a series of messages given by Watchman Nee in his training at Kuling Mountain in 1948 through 1949, contains two distinct but related parts. In 1988 the Living Stream Ministry published the first part under the title Authority and Submission, covering the general subject of spiritual authority and submission. Volume 47 of The Collected Works includes a second, previously untranslated, part covering the matter of being God's deputy authority.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 47: The Orthodoxy of the Church & Authority and Submission &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
