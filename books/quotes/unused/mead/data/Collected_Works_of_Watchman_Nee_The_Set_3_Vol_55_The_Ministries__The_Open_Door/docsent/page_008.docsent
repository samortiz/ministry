   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Greetings in the Lord to Brother Watchman and Brother Witness:</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I left Shanghai on the eleventh and arrived safely in Hankow on the fifteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The problems in the school have all been resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The only matter left is personnel; I am desperately waiting for the coordinating brothers and sisters to come.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My head is heavy, and my body is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I cannot pray or read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I cannot speak or even think.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the church does not make some arrangements for the future of the orphanage, I really feel that I will not be able to carry out my responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I would like to be able to drop this burden and look for a small place in a locality where I could learn to serve God with all the members in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am afraid of ending up in the wrong place, doing the wrong thing, and shaming the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It has been rainy for the last few days, and the river is rising quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is two feet higher than it was in 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the inhabitants of Wuhan are worried.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have been working on the debts and doing the books since my return.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I really ask for guidance with respect to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am awaiting your prompt response.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I respectfully greet you with peace in the Lord.</S>
