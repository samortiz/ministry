<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Q. Bringing Heaven to Earth<br>and Joining Earth to Heaven<br>as the Ladder in Eternity Future</H2><P>For eternity Christ as the Son of Man will bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven as the ladder seen by Jacob (John 1:51; Gen. 28:11-12, 16-19). Nathanael recognized Jesus as the Son of God, but Jesus answered Nathanael by saying that he would see the angels ascending from earth to heaven and descending from heaven to earth upon the Son of Man. The Son of Man is the ladder as the uplifted standing stairway for the traffic of the ascending and descending angels in eternity future. This is a picture of the eternal age. In eternity future the New Jerusalem will be standing in the whole universe as something uplifted toward the heavens upon which the angelic family will ascend and descend to bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven. This is the universal vision of God's economy.</P><P>God's economy will consummate in such a ladder, which is a city. This city is an incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers, an incorporation of God in man and man in God. We will be God's incorporation for God's glory to be manifested in humanity. We will be His dwelling place, the tabernacle (Rev. 21:3), and He will be our dwelling place, the temple (v. 22). That will be the mutual abiding of God in us and us in God to have God's glory manifested in humanity radiantly. This is the conclusion of the humanity of Christ in both the Old and New Testaments.</P><P>Note:While fundamental Christianity was fighting against the heresy that denies the divinity of Christ, another heresy was unconsciously made by some Christians, even Christian teachers, that is, the heresy concerning the humanity of Christ of two points:</P><P>1. Many Christian Bible teachers dare not recognize that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15). This implies that they dare not acknowledge the humanity of Christ, who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation. According to our human view, Christ was born about two thousand years ago. But according to the divine view, He is the Firstborn of all creation. In God's eyes, there is no time element. Although Christ was slain less than two thousand years ago, Revelation 13:8 says that Christ was slain from the foundation of the world. With God there is only the fact, not the element of time. According to the fact, God reckons Christ as the Firstborn of God's old creation so that Christ might be the first in everything. We reject that heresy which says that Christ was only a creature and not God. Christ as God is the Creator, but we also have to recognize that Christ is a part of the creation because He is a man who partook of the created blood and flesh. As such a man, He is the Firstborn of God's old creation.</P><P>2. Some Christians do not believe that after His resurrection Christ is still a man through His ascension, coming back, reigning in the millennium, and being the heavenly ladder in eternity. Probably even a good number of Christian teachers make the same mistake unconsciously. Eventually, the centrality and universality of the entire universe, signified by the New Jerusalem, is Christ as the Son of Man.</P>
