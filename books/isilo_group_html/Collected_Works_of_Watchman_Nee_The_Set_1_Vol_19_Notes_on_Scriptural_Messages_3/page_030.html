Their idea lacks biblical proof. This is their first error. Today I want to discuss their second error.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Presumptions of Those Who Believe<br>That the Whole Church Will Be Raptured<br>before the Tribulation</H2><P>Our brothers who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation not only have farfetched reasons that are unable to stand as reasons, but they also have too many presumptions. Every time we speak about a biblical truth, whether it is as evidence or as background, it should be according to the Bible. If what is said requires too many presumptions and assumptions, it is not reliable. The brothers who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation rely upon too many presumptions. I will now point out their presumptions one by one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The First Presumption</H2><P>Our brothers say that Revelation 1 through 3 speak of the church, and that chapters three through nineteen do not speak of the church any longer, because from chapters four to nineteen the word church is not mentioned. Therefore, chapters one through three are on the church in this age, and chapters four through nineteen are on the future great tribulation. Since chapters four through nineteen do not mention the church, the church must not be on the earth any longer. Since the church is not on the earth, she must have been raptured to heaven.</P><P>Let us consider whether it is reasonable, as far as an argument goes, to make presumptions on the basis that a certain term is not explicitly mentioned. Although the word church is not explicitly mentioned in chapters four through nineteen, the fact of the church is still there. There are several examples.</P><P>Revelation 5:9 says, "And they sing a new song, saying...for You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation." If this group of people, who have been bought by the blood of the Lord, are not the church, who are they? Although the Scripture does not explicitly say that they are the church, can we say that they are not the church?</P><P>Revelation 6:9 says, "And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they had." If this group of people is not the church, who are they? Although the Scripture does not use the word church here, can we say that they are not the church?</P><P>Revelation 7:14 says, "These are those who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." If this group of people is not the church, who are they? Although the Scripture does not use the word church here, we all know that only the church can experience the washing of the robes by the blood of the Lamb.</P><P>Revelation 12:17 says, "The rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus." If this group of people is not the church, who are they? Although the Scripture does not use the word church here, can we say that they are not the church?</P><P>Revelation 17:6 says, "And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus." If this group of slain people is not the church, who are they? We all know that the woman here indicates the Roman Catholic Church. In the past, countless numbers of saints have been persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church. Countless numbers of saints were killed in Spain. Although the Scripture does not use the word church here, can we say that the slain ones here are not the church?</P><P>Revelation 19:11-14 says, "A white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True...And He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called the Word of God. And the armies which are in heaven followed Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean." Many people acknowledge that this is the scene when the Lord Jesus will come with the church to the earth. Even the brothers who believe that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation acknowledge this. Does the Scripture here explicitly use the word church? Can we say that there is no church just because the Scripture does not use the word church here? Since our brothers admit that the church is in chapter nineteen, why do they deny it concerning the other chapters, which also show the fact of the church?</P><P>Revelation 22:6 says, "And he said to me, These words [indicating the whole book of Revelation, including chapters four through nineteen] are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place." Also verse 16 says, "I Jesus have sent My angel to testify to you these things [indicating the things recorded in the entire book of Revelation, including chapters four to nineteen] for the churches." This shows that though the word church is not mentioned in chapters four through nineteen, the sole purpose of mentioning them is for the churches. Therefore, how can we say that in chapters four through nineteen there is no mention of the church?</P><P>For our brothers to make such presumptions and assumptions is altogether wrong. We can see that the points we have mentioned prove that from chapters four to nineteen there are many instances where the fact of the church is mentioned. Although the word church is not explicitly mentioned from chapters four to nineteen, we cannot say that there is not the fact of the church there.</P><P>Moreover, our brothers say that in Revelation 21:9, the wife of the Lamb is the church (though according to the context preceding this verse, the wife of the Lamb refers to the New Jerusalem). May I ask if the word church is mentioned explicitly in 21:9? According to our brothers, since the word church is not mentioned explicitly, the church cannot be there. Why then would our brothers say that 21:9 refers to the church when the word church is not mentioned explicitly? If our brothers admit that the church is here, why do they not admit that the church is in the other chapters also? From this we see that such presumptions cannot stand.</P><P>If from chapters four to nineteen the church is still there, then their assumption that the whole church is raptured before the tribulation (beginning from chapter four) cannot stand. If there will still be people belonging to the church in the tribulation, how can we say that the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation?</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3) &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
