   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THINGS OPPOSING GOD'S EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today four negative things oppose God's expression: human culture, religion, ethics, and tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God created man to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God was man's portion, but in the fall man fell away from God and lost God, so man turned to his own invention, human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Humanly speaking, culture is not bad, yet it is a replacement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God should be everything to man his pleasure, his satisfaction, his protection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But man lost God, and man turned away from God to something else, human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then in human culture, man discovered that he needs God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So in the human culture another item was invented, religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In human culture there is an invention concerning the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As long as you are in the human race you worship something.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man was created to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whether people worship rightly or wrongly they have the need to worship something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was discovered by human culture, and the invention of religion came in.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, man likes to be right and to be good because God created something in man's nature that is good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course, according to our fallen nature, there is another tendency to do evil things, but according to God's created nature there is a tendency to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So through all the generations ethics and morality have been promoted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In China, Confucius was the greatest promoter of ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the culture, religion, and ethics a lot of tradition came out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of the traditions are not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But all these things culture, religion, ethics, and tradition are four layers upon your eyes to veil you from seeing Christ as God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is hard to convince the Chinese people to believe in Christ because Confucius' ethical teachings have become a thick veil upon the Chinese eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, the Jewish religion has become a thick veil preventing the Jews from believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They consider that they have the typical religion, a religion founded by Moses according to the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, for the last three and a half years He was opposed by the Jews mainly due to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By reading John 9 you can realize that the Pharisees thought of themselves as disciples of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They had their inherited religion which was so typical, so right, and so holy, yet the Lord Jesus indicated that they were blind vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>39-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Judaism had become a thick veil to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today if you talk to people who are in the Catholic Church you will realize that Catholicism is a thick veil upon their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One brother who was an altar boy in the Catholic Church got saved while he was in high school.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was so happy, and he went back to tell his parents and grandparents that he had the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They pointed to the pictures of Jesus on their walls and told him that they had had Jesus for generations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They had Jesus in the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They had Jesus in the bedroom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They had Jesus everywhere, but not within them!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Surely Jesus does not like to be hung upon the wall or carved or painted.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus wants to be within you, in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus is not an idol, nor is He an image.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus today is on the throne in the heavens as the Lord of all and as the Head over all things, yet at the same time He is a living Spirit who can enter into our spirit.</S>
