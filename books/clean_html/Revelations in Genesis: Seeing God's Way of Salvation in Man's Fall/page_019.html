<h2 class="head2">Living for God</h2>
<p>The second step in escaping the fall is to live for God. Abel was a tender of sheep. At that time God did not allow man to eat meat. God allowed man to eat meat only after Noah and his family came out of the ark (Gen. 9:3-4). The use of sheep as an offering to God and sheepskin as a covering for man&rsquo;s shame typify the two aspects of Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Hence, Abel&rsquo;s occupation was to serve God and live for God. In contrast, Cain tilled the ground in order to produce food. He was for his own living and for feeding himself.</p>
<p>Therefore, the second step in escaping the fall is to live for God. We should not take these things as doctrine. We need to be watchful, because when we care only for our living and food, we are in the fall. In order to escape from continuing in the fall, we must make serving God and living for God our priority. Regrettably, the priority of many Christians on the earth is their living and food. People have committed many evils in order to maintain their livelihood. If we want to overcome evil things, the first step is to overcome our prioritization of our livelihood. We should not live on the earth for food; we should live for God. We should take God as our goal, center, living, and purpose. Living for God is a great salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Vanity of Human Life</h2>
<p>The third step in escaping the fall is to know the vanity of human life. This is revealed in the name <em>Abel,</em> which means &ldquo;vanity,&rdquo; or &ldquo;dissipating,&rdquo; like smoke, clouds, or air. Fallen human life is vanity. If fallen man is not saved by God and delivered out of his own will to live for God, his human life is vanity.</p>
<p>Solomon, who was the wisest king, said, &ldquo;Vanity of vanities; all is vanity&rdquo; (Eccl. 1:2). He understood that the ultimate issue of human life is vanity of vanities. A human life without God, a fallen human life, is a vain human life. Abel knew this vanity, so he put aside his opinions and disregarded his own living in order to live for God according to the revelation of God. Abel realized that everything outside of God is vanity; hence, he despised everything outside of God and took God as the goal of his living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Frailty of Man</h2>
<p>The fourth step in escaping the fall is to know the frailty of man. <em>Enosh</em> is another interesting name in Genesis 4. <em>Enosh</em> means &ldquo;frail, mortal man.&rdquo; This implies that to escape from walking on the path of the fall, we need to know the frailty of man. We need to know that man is nothing and can break, just as a glass cup breaks easily. This is frailty. Man is frail. Some people do not know themselves. They think that they are smart, wise, and strong, when in fact they have nothing of which to boast. When a car hits a man, he is as fragile as a glass cup. When he is infected with tuberculosis, he must lie down. He may even die from tuberculosis. Man&rsquo;s life is frail. Man&rsquo;s name is Abel, but man&rsquo;s name is also Enosh. <em>Abel</em> means that man is vain, but <em>Enosh</em> means that man is frail. People who dream about their life should wake up. Man is not strong. Man will collapse when he is sick, and he will die if a car hits him. A wife can collapse when she is mad at her husband. She can even get ulcers because of her anger. A person can live to be one hundred years at most. The Chinese say that few can live to the age of seventy. Being fifty years old is not yet the twilight hour, but it is already four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Some people are at eight or nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening. There is a hymn that says, &ldquo;Swift to its close ebbs our life&rsquo;s little day&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #370, stanza 2). People must wake up from their dreams, because human life is vain and frail. In order to escape the fall, we must realize the meaning of human life. Those who continue in the fall do not know their own human life. In chapter 4 those who were delivered out of the fall knew that human life is vain and frail.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Calling on the Name of Jehovah</h2>
<p>The fifth step in escaping the fall is to call upon the name of Jehovah (Gen. 4:26). <em>Jehovah</em> means the &ldquo;self-existing and ever-existing One.&rdquo; Man is Enosh, but God is Jehovah. Man is frail and mortal, but God is self-existing, ever-existing, and eternal. Enosh called upon Jehovah because he knew that he was temporal, frail, and mortal, and he fully entrusted himself to God. Enosh knew that God is eternal, immortal, and reliable, because He is Jehovah.</p>
<p>We need to understand the meaning of the first four chapters of Genesis. The way of Cain is the way of following one&rsquo;s own will, the way of living for oneself. Those who walked on this way did not know the vanity of human life, nor did they sense the frailty of human life. They felt that they were capable in building cities and inventing cultures, but they did not know that they were taking the way of the fall. Abel, Seth, and Enosh were a different group of people. They did not follow their own will but instead lived by God. They knew that human life is vain, frail, and mortal; hence, they offered sacrifices to God, served God, and called upon the name of Jehovah. This is how they escaped from the fall.</p>
