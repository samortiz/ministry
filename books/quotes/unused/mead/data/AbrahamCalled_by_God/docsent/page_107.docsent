   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHARGING HIS SERVANT WITH THE LORD Abraham did not charge his servant to be faithful, honest, or to do a good work; he charged him with and by the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>2-3, 9, 40-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here we see that the atmosphere in which Abraham lived was the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By charging his servant with the Lord, he brought him deep into the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, we should not charge people with our wisdom or even with our love, but with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>BELIEVING IN THE SOVEREIGN LORD Abraham believed in the sovereign Lord, telling his servant that the Lord would send His angel with him and prosper his way v. 40 . Abraham seemed to be saying, "God will send His angel before you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although I am sending you to do the job, I believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a sense, I don't believe that you can accomplish this work, but I trust in the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You don't need to be burdened or to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just go and do the job, for my God will send His angel to do the work for you."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What a life Abraham had!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we had been Abraham, we might have said, "My servant, you must realize that I have passed through many experiences.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Abraham did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, he only charged his servant to serve by the Lord, assuring him that God would send His angel before him and prosper his way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here we see Abraham's living faith.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I believe that he was infused by and with Abraham's life, seeing how Abraham did everything by trusting in the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he came to the well near the city of Nahor, he prayed, saying, "O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good success this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also; let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master" vv.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>LOOKING FOR THE LORD'S LEADING IN THE ENVIRONMENT The servant knew the Lord's will by looking for His leading in the environment vv.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>13-21, 26-27, 48-49 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We also can see God's sovereignty in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one told the servant to go to the city of Nahor, the city of Abraham's brother.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He just went there and at the well he met Rebekah, Nahor's granddaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nothing was accidental; everything was ordained before the foundation of the world and was carried out through Abraham's servant, a man who trusted in God.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the young sisters want to be under God's sovereignty, especially with respect to their marriage, they need to be kind and diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Any young woman who is unkind and sloppy should remain single.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When people ask you to do one thing, you must do two things for them.</S>
