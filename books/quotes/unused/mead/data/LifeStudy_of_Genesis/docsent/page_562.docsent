   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>8 Concerning Zebulun and Issachar a Zebulun Being at the Haven of the Sea</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Judah, Zebulun comes in. Verse 13 says, "Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon." This verse says Zebulun is a haven for ships.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The method of transportation here has been changed from asses to ships.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We cannot understand the poetry in this verse without referring to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fulfillment of this verse is in Matthew 4:15, which says, "Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ began His ministry from Zebulun in Galilee, and it was the Galileans who brought the glad tidings of Christ to all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Galilean disciples were a haven of ships.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They brought forth the good news of Christ as the fighting, resting, and producing lion to every part of the world represented by Zidon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>b Zebulun Rejoicing in Going Out</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Deuteronomy 33:18 says, "Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to this verse, Zebulun had to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And Zebulun did go out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the Galileans went out with the glad tidings of the victory of Christ, bearing the word of the victorious, restful, and productive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These Galileans went forth with Christ's victory, Christ's satisfaction, and Christ's productiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although Zebulun went out, Issachar stayed in the tents Deut 33:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, Zebulun rejoiced in going out, and Issachar rejoiced in his tents.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One had to go out, and the other had to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>c Issachar Being a Strong Ass</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Couching between the Sheepfolds</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Genesis 49:14 says, "Issachar is a strong ass couching down between the sheepfolds."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In interpretation, this is linked to the foal and the colt, the young ass, in verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The young ass there is tied to the rich harvest; hence, the strong ass is couching, resting, here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Issachar is not working; he is couching, that is, he is lying down and resting between the sheepfolds.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are you today's Issachar?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are you couching or laboring?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some think I am always working.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But they are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They do not realize that my working is my couching.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a hymn which says that as we work, we rest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I do not work, I have no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more I work, the more I rest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As I am working, I am couching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Lord's recovery there is no need for laboring asses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although we need strong asses, they should couch, not work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to the picture portrayed in this verse, Issachar is couching between the sheepfolds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although the strong ass does nothing, the sheep produce the milk.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can testify that I am a strong ass couching down and watching the sheep produce milk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While you are producing the milk, I am resting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>d Issachar Enjoying Rest in the Rich Land</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>and Becoming a Servant under Taskwork</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 15 says, "And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant under taskwork" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Issachar saw that the rest was good and that the land was pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Issachar, the strong ass, is resting and enjoying the pleasant, rich land, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At such a time, he bows his shoulder to bear burdens and thus he becomes a servant under taskwork.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that he serves in order to have something to offer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead of "under taskwork," the King James Version says "unto tribute," which is a payment given as an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without experience, we cannot understand this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to Christian experience, proper Christians do not labor as hard-working asses.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, they rest as strong asses.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While they are resting, they enjoy the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through the enjoyment of these riches, they become willing to bow their shoulder, take up a burden and serve for tribute rendered to the King.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the proper church life, we do not labor as common asses.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead we lie down to rest and enjoy both the finished work of Christ and the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By this enjoyment we are willing to bow our shoulder and lift up a heavy burden, serving to gain tribute to render to our Master, our King.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although this will be completely fulfilled in the millennium, we have a foretaste of it in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the church life we experience our Christ as the fighting, resting, and producing lion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Due to His victorious work, there is a rich produce, a rich harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, there is no need for our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But there is the preaching of the glad tidings concerning Christ; for Zebulun, the haven of ships, sends out the good news of the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We also have the experience of Issachar.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are not laboring; rather, we are resting and enjoying the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As we rest and enjoy Christ in such a way, we are willing to bow our shoulder to bear a heavy burden to do the taskwork, the work assigned by our King-Master, so that we may be able to render tribute to our King.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, today's church life is a miniature of the coming millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you pray over all the points covered in this message and digest them, you will see that in this portion of the Word we have a portrait of the coming millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This portrait reveals that we may now participate in a miniature of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>By considering this picture, we shall know where we must be today.</S>
