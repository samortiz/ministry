   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lesson Fourteen THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL Scripture Reading 1 Cor 2:14-15; 1 Thes 5:23; Gen 2:7; Prov 20:27; Heb 4:12;</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2 Cor 7:1; Eph 2:1, 5; Heb 9:14; 2 Tim 4:22; Gal 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Outline The soul being different from the spirit Spirit and soul and body Joints and marrow Trichotomy and dichotomy The parts of man At creation After the fall In salvation The Spirit as the new person Text</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our spirit was created by God as the organ for us to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must not confuse it with another organ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose a medical doctor considered that the stomach, the heart, the liver, and the kidneys were all synonyms for the same organ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What kind of doctor could he be!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we desire to have true spiritual growth in life, we must know that the spirit and the soul are two different things, and we must be able to discern what is the spirit and what is the soul, what is spiritual and what is soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we can discern the difference between the spirit and the soul, we then can deny the soul, be delivered from the soul, and live by the spirit before God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. THE SOUL BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are going to know our human spirit we must see the difference between the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The most important passage showing us the difference between the spirit and the soul is 1 Corinthians 2:14-15: "But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he is not able to know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he is discerned by no one."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 14 tells us clearly that the soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The soulish man can never know anything about God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There's no possibility for the soulish man to know God, but in the following verse it says the spirit, the human spirit, knows.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the soulish man there is no possibility to know God, but with the spiritual man there is the full possibility.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So by these two verses you can see the difference between the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are a man of the soul you can never know anything of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you are a man of the spirit, then you know the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By this passage we can see the difference between the spirit and the soul, yet so many Christians today still insist on saying that the spirit and the soul are synonymous terms.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, 1 Corinthians 2:14-15 shows that with the soul there is no possibility to know anything of God, but with the spirit there is the full possibility.</S>
