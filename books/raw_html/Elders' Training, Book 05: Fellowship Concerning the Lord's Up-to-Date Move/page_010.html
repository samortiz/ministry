<h2 class="head1">SEEING AND MINISTERING<br />
THE MYSTERY OF GODLINESS</h2>
<p>I believe this is why the Apostle Paul, after writing Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews, wrote 1 Timothy in such a way. He was so experienced. He knew the secret of how to take care of the church under degradation. For this reason, in this book he stressed the truth, the word. He said God &ldquo;desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth&rdquo; (2:4). He also said the church, which is the house of the living God, is the pillar and base of the truth (3:15). The truth is the mystery of godliness, and this mystery of godliness is the manifestation of the Triune God. This means that, as a church, surely all the members have to know the manifestation of the Triune God, to know the mystery of godliness, to know the truth. The truth in 1 Timothy 2:4 is not the truth mainly concerning baptism, nor the truth mainly concerning the gifts, but the truth concerning the Triune God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>Can the elders teach such a truth concerning the embodiment of the Triune God and the realization of this embodiment, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God? You may think it is wonderful to teach a little about justification by faith, about holiness, and concerning the gifts. That is not the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The church is the pillar and base of the truth. It is not mainly the truth of items such as the presbytery, baptism, or even the smaller item of the miraculous gifts. The truth, of which the church is the pillar and base, is a great truth&mdash;the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh through the church. A proper church is the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh.</p>
<p>We should take care of such a truth. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has brought us thus far to this point. Items like baptism and the gifts are more than elementary, something in the stage of kindergarten. Where are we now? We are in the embodiment of the Triune God realized by the all-inclusive Spirit who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. You may say that you are in the recovery, that you are one with the ministry, and that you are for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony today, but where are you actually? I propose that we have a time for desperate prayer. It is worthwhile to fast and pray. Fast and pray that the Lord would open your eyes to see such a vision of the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh through the church. Then you will have a vision and this vision will govern, direct, control, preserve, and protect you from being led astray. Then you will have the solid Word to minister to the churches.</p>
<p>This is what we all need. We are no longer in kindergarten. The new believers among us, no doubt, are still in kindergarten, but as a whole, the recovery today is not in kindergarten. We have carried out the standard education passing through kindergarten, elementary, junior high, and even high school. Today we are at least in college. To stress anything low is to bring the recovery back to kindergarten. The standard of education in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not that low today. Fifty-two years ago it was, but not today. I say this based on the thirty-six messages I delivered to you in the 1984 elders&rsquo; training. I encourage you to get a copy of these messages and at least to read through them once, but I also hope that you would study them, especially the first two books on the ministry of the New Testament and on the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If possible you should study all four books. I believe that anyone who reads these messages fairly would say that this is the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date present word to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING IN THE WORD AND TEACHING</h2>
<p>I would ask the elders, who should be apt to teach and who should labor in word and in teaching, what they would teach. To answer this question you have to go back to some of the verses in 1 Timothy. The truth in 1 Timothy 2:4 refers to the mystery of godliness which is the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh. Paul also charged the deacons to hold the mystery of the faith (3:9). If I were to ask some deacons to tell us what the mystery of the faith is, they might not be able. Is faith in this verse the believing ability, the believing act, the so-called subjective faith, or is this objective faith, referring to the things we believe in? Even some elders may not know this.</p>
<p>This is why I have a deep and heavy concern for all the brothers in the leadership. Do we all really labor? To labor is not just to work but to toil. If the elders would be laboring in the Word and in teaching, I believe that all the local churches would be wonderful. To labor in the Spirit and forget about the Word only results in confusion and vanity. The Southern Baptists would not allow their pastors to emphasize the Spirit. They labor on the Word and forget about the Spirit. In the Pentecostal movement they labor on the Spirit and forget about the Word. Which result is higher? The Southern Baptists are the largest denomination in the United States. This is the result of taking the Word first.</p>
<p>We would not take the way of the Southern Baptists or the way of the Pentecostals. The way we would take is to focus on the Word by the Spirit. This is the right way. In the Bible the Word is first and not the Spirit. The entire New Testament points to the Word first; then you come to the Spirit. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word.&rdquo; Do not forget this. Then out of this Word comes the Spirit. The Spirit is the consummation of the Word. The Spirit is not the foundation or the source. We have to see this. I like the Spirit because the Spirit is my enjoyment; the Spirit does every work for me. With the Word, however, I have to labor. I have to labor on book after book, chapter after chapter, and item after item. To pick up all the verses on the divine Word from the twenty-seven books of the New Testament requires a lot of labor. This is what you should do. Do not expect that you could build up the church &ldquo;in the air.&rdquo; The church could only be built up on the truth. Otherwise, it could never be the pillar and base of the truth. We all have to labor in the Word and in teaching, and we all have to hold the mystery of the faith, the mystery of what we believe in.</p>
<p>The cause of all the problems among us has been the shortage of the full knowledge of the truth. A shortage of the knowledge of the truth means ignorance, blindness, and darkness. Without electricity in the room enabling the lights to shine, we would make a lot of blunders in the darkness; we would do a lot of nonsensical things. This is why I have a real burden that we would all reconsider our situation. It is altogether a pitiful thing to remain in darkness. This is why we began this training with Acts 26:19 and Proverbs 29:18. We need the heavenly vision because without this vision we will run wild. We need the full knowledge of the truth.</p>
