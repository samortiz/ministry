<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF<br />
LEAVING ORGANIZATIONS AND SECTS</h2>
<p>In the sixteenth century the Reformation was fully formed, and in the seventeenth century the knowledge of the inner life was prominent. A hundred years later, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Moravian Brethren and Count Zinzendorf were raised up. This was an important development in the recovery, which emphasized leaving politics and earthly organizations.</p>
<p>The recovery in the sixteenth century was justification by faith; it failed to bring the church out of politics and even became involved with politics. Only when Count Zinzendorf and a group of brothers were raised up did the church escape from its ties with worldly governments and earthly organizations. They were able to have such a recovery because of their background and their long-term view. Their background was the seed planted by John Huss three hundred years earlier. At the time of John Huss, many people in northern Europe loved the Lord with a pure heart and could not accept the fallen religion of their day. They opposed the organized church and were driven out of their countries by fierce persecution. These believers moved to Bohemia.</p>
<p>Bohemia is north of Austria in the western half of the Czech Republic, a place which Hitler and the British fought for in the Second World War. When the brothers in Moravia were persecuted for loving the Lord, they moved to Bohemia. Count Zinzendorf, who loved the Lord, lived in Bohemia and took these brothers in; moreover, according to the wisdom given him from the Lord, he led them to drop their backgrounds and to begin to meet in oneness. When they left their lands to move to Bohemia, they spontaneously broke off their relationship with the world&rsquo;s political organizations and with the fallen organization of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF<br />
GOING OUT TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Historians do not record that Zinzendorf had any special title in the church. He was not a clergyman; he was merely a brother among the Moravian Brethren. These brothers left both worldly and religious organizations; they were very living and strong. In fifty years they sent out more missionaries to preach the gospel in foreign lands than all the mission boards in the entire world had sent out in the preceding two centuries. They were very strong at that time. Because they had left worldly and religious organizations, the Holy Spirit was able to work freely among them. They recovered going out into the entire earth to bring the testimony of the gospel to all people. Moreover, the Moravian Brethren had many special characteristics, such as loving one another and having a condition of one accord. John Wesley, who was edified by them, said that if it were not for his burden to return to England, he wanted to stay with the Brethren in Bohemia for the rest of his life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF BAPTISM</h2>
<p>At the time of the Moravian Brethren, all the churches were state churches. The Roman Catholic Church was a state church, and the Protestant churches were state churches. Even today several northern European countries still have the Lutheran Church as their state church. But since the time of the Reformation, some have come out of the state churches and established the so-called private churches, such as the Baptist Church, the Wesleyan Church, and the Presbyterian Church. Just prior to or around the same time as the formation of the private churches, the matter of baptism was recovered. Thus, some believers spontaneously formed the Baptist Church. John Bunyan, who wrote the book <em>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,</em> was a member of the Baptist Church. Those who recovered the matter of baptism also broke off their relationships with earthly governments and established churches apart from the state churches.</p>
