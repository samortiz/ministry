<h2 class=head2>The Blind Man Cast Out of the Fold</h2><p>The blind man in chapter nine was among the chosen ones in the sheepfold. He may not have been willing to go out of the fold, but the Pharisees, the thieves and robbers, cast him out. We may say that they ushered him out of the sheepfold. But although the Pharisees cast him out of the fold, he actually came out through Jesus Christ as the door.<h2 class=head2>Enjoying Christ as the Pasture in the Daylight</h2><p>Throughout the centuries of the New Testament age, many “folds” have been established. Actually, every denomination and nearly every Christian group has become a fold. In the fold there is a shortage of light. Some of God’s chosen people are still in the darkness, even though the New Testament age is in the daytime, not in the nighttime.<p>Have you ever heard that for us who are enjoying Christ as the pasture this is the daytime? As one who is in the church life in the Lord’s recovery, I do not have the sense that I am in the night. However, I did not have this feeling when I was in a denomination. But after I was brought by the Lord into the enjoyment of Christ, my night was turned to day. Has this not been your experience as well? Many of us can testify that in the church life we are in a spiritual day. Praise the Lord that we are in bright daylight! Inwardly we are filled with light, and outwardly we are surrounded with light.<p>However, in our daily experience sometimes we are still in the night. When we are strong in the spirit, we are in the day. But when we are in the flesh, we are in the night. In our spiritual experience the spirit is a day to us, and the flesh is night.<p>There is a hymn which speaks of Jesus as the wonderful Shepherd who brought us out of the fold into the pasture that is so good to our spirit.<p class=hbody>Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd,<br>Brought us right out of the fold<br>Into His pasture so plenteous,<br>Into His riches untold.</p><p class=hbody2>Glorious church life,<br>Feasting from such a rich store!<br>Here where we’re dwelling in oneness<br>God commands life evermore.</p><p class=hbody>In the divisions He sought us,<br>Weary and famished for food;<br>Into the good land He brought us,<br>Oh, to our spirit how good!</p><p class=hbody>Jesus Himself is our pasture,<br>He is the food that we eat;<br>We as His sheep are fed richly<br>Each time, whenever we meet.</p><p class=hbody>Hymns, #1221</p><p>A flock is in the pasture during the daytime. In a similar way, if in our Christian experience we are in the pasture, we shall also be in the daylight. The brightest time for us is when we are in the spirit enjoying the pasture. But our darkest time is when we are in the flesh. When we are in the flesh, we are full of lust, self, and the old man. What darkness that is! Praise the Lord that when we are in the spirit we are full of light!<p>Jesus Christ the Lord is life to us. According to John 1:4, this life is the light of men. Therefore, when we have life, we have light. Moreover, when we have light, we are in the day. We thank the Lord that sovereignly He has brought us out of the folds into the pasture and out of night into day.
