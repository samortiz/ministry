<h1 class="title">OUR ATTITUDE</h1>
<p>The brothers often do not know what kind of attitude we should have toward other Christian groups. This is a practical problem that all the saints have encountered; therefore, we will spend some time to consider this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>We must have a clear understanding concerning the condition of Christianity. The church has been in existence for two thousand years, and it has spread to nearly every continent and every race of people on the earth. It is difficult for anything that exists for a long period of time, covers a vast area, and reaches so many people to remain in its original form. Hence, after two thousand years the church has become deformed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Deformed Christianity</h2>
<p>Christianity has been in existence for a long period of time, has spread across a vast area of the earth, and has reached many races. As a result of these complicating elements, it was unavoidable that Christianity would become deformed. No rational person would believe that Christianity has kept the original form of the church from the first century. People have deformed and changed the church. Therefore, we must be willing to question every aspect of what is found in the church and practiced by the church. We must ask whether the current condition of the church matches the original condition of the church. We cannot indiscriminately accept or hastily acknowledge anything. Instead, we should investigate everything. Anything that is right and according to God will not suffer from such an investigation.</p>
<p>We should serve the Lord strictly in accordance with the form of the initial church. Regardless of how good or important something may be in the eyes of man, we should avoid and drop whatever does not correspond to the original form of the church. We should drop anything that has become deformed through the alteration of man. We need to come back to the original form of the church.</p>
<p>There are several matters in which the church has become deformed. First, there are many different denominations in Christianity. We should ask whether the church had so many denominations in the beginning. If we look into this matter, we will realize that the initial church did not have denominations. The initial church was not divided into denominations and sects. The church first appeared on the earth in many localities, but the church in each locality was not divided into denominations or sects. There was only the church in Ephesus (Rev. 2:1); there were no denominations in Ephesus. There was only the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 1:1); there were no denominations in Corinth. However, today there are many different Christian denominations. These denominations did not exist at the time of the initial church; they were founded by people. In the beginning there were elders in the church, but there was no Presbyterian Church. In the beginning the church practiced baptism, but there was no Baptist Church. In the beginning the church taught holiness, but there was no Holiness Church. In the beginning there was justification by faith, but there was no Lutheran Church. In the beginning the church had spiritual gifts, but there was no Pentecostal Church. These and other denominations speak of the deformed situation of Christianity, which we must drop.</p>
<p>Second, Protestant churches have pastors, and the Catholic Church has priests. After careful study, it is clear that there were no pastors or priests in the initial church; these positions were invented by men at a later time. There were gifts, such as shepherds and teachers, in the initial church (Eph. 4:11), but there was no pastoral system, priestly system, or clerical system. In the beginning all the believers in the church served God as priests (1 Pet. 2:5). There was not a group of people who served as intermediaries between the believers and God. There also was not a special group of clerical men who served God. The believers in the initial church did not serve God according to the present pastoral, priestly, or clerical systems. These systems came into existence through changes made by man; hence, these systems are deformed and should be denied and repudiated.</p>
<p>Third, Christianity has professional preachers, who receive a salary. This is a deformity. In the beginning there were workers who were sent by the Lord but not professional preachers who were hired by man. There were believers who served the Lord and lived by faith but not believers who preached the word as a profession and means of income. Any system involving professional preaching is deformed, and it is the result of the degradation of Christianity.</p>
<p>Fourth, the buildings used by the Catholic Church and by Protestant churches are also deformities. The believers in the initial church gathered together in many different places (Acts 4:31; 20:8) but not in church buildings. Our meeting places should not be so-called sanctuaries. If we regarded our meeting place as a sanctuary or a chapel, this would mean that believers should worship only in a sanctuary or in a designated place of worship. However, we can worship anywhere. Worship is not a matter of place but of being in spirit. In John 4 the Lord said, &ldquo;An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father...God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit&rdquo; (vv. 21, 24). Our spirit is the location of our worship to God; hence, we can worship Him at any time and at any place. Every place can be a place of worship. So-called church buildings did not exist in the initial church; they were produced by degraded Christianity. The finest buildings in many places in the world are church buildings. This is not according to the original appearance of the church; rather, it is the result of man-made changes.</p>
<p>Fifth, in many cases the practice of baptism has become deformed. In the early church the practice of baptism involved the immersion of people into water (Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:5, 8; Acts 8:38). The present practice of baptism in Christianity mainly involves sprinkling a few drops of water on a person&rsquo;s head. Although the Baptist Church practices baptism by immersion, only pastors can baptize people. This is also a deformed situation. The New Testament shows that those who preached the gospel and brought others to salvation also baptized those who received the gospel (Acts 8:26-38; 9:10-18). This was done in a serious and proper way; it was not a light or casual matter. There was no practice in the church of believers preaching the gospel and then pastors baptizing those who received the Lord. There was not the situation of gospel preaching by the laity but baptizing by the clergy. The present system of only pastors baptizing by either immersion or sprinkling did not exist in the initial church. Such a deformed practice was brought in by man.</p>
<p>Sixth, the practice of the so-called holy communion is also deformed. The Catholic mass is far removed from the original condition of the breaking of bread referred to in the Bible, and holy communion practiced in Protestantism is also far removed. Even the term <em>holy communion</em> is a deformity. The Bible uses the term <em>the Lord&rsquo;s supper</em> (1 Cor. 11:20) but never the term <em>holy communion.</em> Some denominations use small pieces of bread in their practice, but this is not like the practice in the initial church, in which all believers partook of one bread and of wine from one cup as a testimony of the one Body of Christ (10:16-17). Using many pieces of bread and separate cups is a deformed situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is a common thought that all believers can receive holy communion but that only pastors and priests can administer holy communion. As a result, two different positions have been formed, the administrators and the recipients. According to the Bible, however, the saints who come before the Lord to break bread all have the same position, and all are recipients. There is a not designated administrator (Matt. 26:26-28; 1 Cor. 10:16-17). Everyone receives from the Lord&rsquo;s hand directly; no one represents the Lord to administer the bread to others. Any person who is a representative has stepped beyond his limit and is usurping the Lord&rsquo;s authority. Even if Paul were in our midst today, he would only be a brother partaking of the Lord&rsquo;s supper with us. Paul would not be able to represent the Lord in order to administer the Lord&rsquo;s supper, because we all have the same position. When the initial church broke bread, all the believers were recipients; no one represented the Lord as an administrator.</p>
<p>Seventh, in some Christian groups the elders are elected by the believers. This is a deformed situation. According to the Bible, the elders in the initial church were not elected by the believers. The elders were produced when certain brothers were manifested as being more mature and more experienced among the believers (Acts 15:2; 1 Tim. 5:17). When such ones were manifested, they were appointed to the eldership by apostles or someone designated by them according to the leading of the Spirit (Titus 1:5). The present practice of electing elders, that is, of believers voting for who should be an elder, was not present in the initial church.</p>
<p>Eighth, the celebration of different feasts, such as Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter, is a product of deformed Christianity. Other than participating in the Lord&rsquo;s supper in remembrance of the Lord, the church did not have any other memorials or feasts. The Bible records the Lord&rsquo;s birth, death, and resurrection, but it does not command us to celebrate Christmas, Good Friday, or Easter. According to church history, such feasts were not in the initial church; they were brought in at a later time. Some of these feasts are even mixed with pagan practices; hence, these celebrations are deformed.</p>
<p>Christianity has numerous other deformed practices, which we cannot enumerate here. These things did not exist in the initial church; they were added later by man. Hence, these practices are deformed. Whatever practice is not according to the Bible must be rejected.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Serving According to Revelation &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
