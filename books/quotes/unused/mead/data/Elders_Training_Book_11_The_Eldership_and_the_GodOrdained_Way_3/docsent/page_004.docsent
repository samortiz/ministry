   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 5:29 says, "For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As His Body, the church becomes His counterpart, His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Church Being the Mystery of Christ,</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both of these mysteries are the great mystery Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is a mystery, and His mystery is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are to know the mystery of Christ, we have to know the church.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Each local church is a testimony of Christ in its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the testimony, the expression of God, and the church is the testimony, the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A local church is a testimony, a "photograph," of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This "photograph," this picture, is better than a thousand words.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is one universally as the Body of Christ and one locally as the local testimony, the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the local testimonies, the churches are many, but in each city there should only be one local church as Christ's unique expression in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church, both universally and locally, has only one Head.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church also has one Spirit Eph 4:4 , that is, one life, one Lord 4:5 , and one God, the Father of all 4:6 .</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the elders must see this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some people say that as long as we love the Lord and live Him, we can serve Him properly regardless of what ground we stand on.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To these persons, it does not mean much whether there is one church or thirty "churches" in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They say that we have to exercise generality and broaden our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To them, as long as people love the Lord, serve the Lord, and even live the Lord, it is not wrong for them to meet in their own way.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no need to speak too many words concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should simply ask them, "Has Christ been divided?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If not, then why are you divided?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is the need of such a basic realization and understanding of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The elders, especially those who are somewhat new in the eldership, should get into all these points that they may know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then they will know the truth, and their understanding, their attitude, and their standing, their ground, will be upright.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be elders caring for God's allotment, we need to know the truth.</S>
