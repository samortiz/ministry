<h1 class="title">The Necessity of Spiritual Warfare,<br />
the Vision of the War in Heaven,<br />
and the Ultimate War&mdash;the War at Armageddon</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 3:15; Matt. 6:9-10, 13b; 12:28; Eph. 6:10-13; Rev. 12:1-17; 19:11-21</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Spiritual warfare is necessary because Satan&rsquo;s will is set against God&rsquo;s will&mdash;Matt. 6:10; 7:21; Isa. 14:12-14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we would know how the church can be God&rsquo;s warrior to engage in spiritual warfare, we need to realize that in the universe there are three wills&mdash;the divine will, the satanic will, and the human will:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Spiritual warfare has its source in the conflict between the divine will and the satanic will.</li>
		<li>God wants His creature <em>man</em> to deal with His fallen creature <em>Satan;</em> for this, the human will must stand with the divine will&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Matt. 26:39; 12:30; 7:21.</li>
		<li>As the church, our fighting is to subdue the satanic will and to defeat God&rsquo;s enemy&mdash;Rev. 12:11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The purpose of spiritual warfare is to bring in the kingdom of God&mdash;Rev. 12:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Spiritual warfare is the warfare between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan&mdash; Matt. 12:26, 28.</li>
		<li>The kingdom of God is the exercise of the divine will and the overthrowing of the power of Satan by the power of God&mdash;6:10; 12:28:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>When the devil is unable to stand in a certain place, the kingdom has come to that place&mdash;12:28.</li>
			<li>Wherever the devil has been cast out and wherever the work of the enemy has been displaced by God&rsquo;s power, the kingdom of God is there&mdash;Rev. 12:10; 11:15.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The work of the church on earth is to bring in the kingdom of God&mdash;Matt. 16:18-19.</li>
		<li>Through prayer the church must release the power of the kingdom of God upon the earth&mdash; 6:9-10, 13; 18:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Revelation 12 presents a great vision concerning the war in heaven&mdash;the warfare in the universe between God and His enemy:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The vision in this chapter unveils the true situation in the universe&mdash;the view that God&rsquo;s enemy is fighting against Him&mdash;vv. 1-4, 7-9, 13, 17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For us to know God&rsquo;s economy, we need to see the spiritual things behind the physical things, the spiritual world behind the physical world&mdash;Dan. 10:12-13, 20-21.</li>
		<li>It is crucial for us to see that behind the physical scene a spiritual struggle, a struggle not seen with human eyes, is taking place.</li>
		<li>In our fighting we deal not with things that appear on the surface but with the power of darkness behind these things&mdash;Eph. 2:6; 6:12; S. S. 4:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Among the many crucial matters in the second section of Revelation is the vision of the universal bright woman with her man-child fighting against the dragon&mdash;12:1-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>War is raging between the dragon and the woman, who symbolizes God&rsquo;s people and represents God.</li>
		<li>We all need to be aware of the warfare between the dragon and the woman; this vision must become a governing vision to us&mdash;Prov. 29:18a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The battle is fought by the man-child, the stronger part within the woman, who bears the responsibility to fight against the enemy&mdash; Rev. 12:4-5, 11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The overcomers fight against Satan continually, even unto death, and defeat him on earth; however, heaven is still waiting for them to arrive there that war may be waged to cast Satan out of heaven&mdash;vv. 5, 7-11.</li>
		<li>The part of the church which will be the man-child to fight against the enemy in the heavens will also be the army to fight against Satan on earth&mdash;19:14; 17:14.</li>
		<li>We should begin now to be qualified, equipped, and perfected to be among those who will be raptured to execute God&rsquo;s judgment upon Satan.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>According to Revelation 19:11-21 Christ will come as a fighting General with His bride, the overcoming believers who are His army, to fight Antichrist, the kings under him, and their armies at Armageddon:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Under the instigation of Antichrist, man will wage war against the King of kings and the Lord of lords&mdash;v. 16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is God coming to fight against rebellious mankind, and mankind is represented by a man who is one with Satan&mdash;Antichrist&mdash; v. 19.</li>
		<li>These two parties&mdash;Christ and Antichrist&mdash; will fight; man will fight against God directly.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When Christ comes with His army to fight against Antichrist and his armies, He will come as the Son of Man&mdash;Matt. 26:64; Rev. 14:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the Son of Man He will need a counterpart to match and complete Him; this counterpart will be His bride&mdash;John 3:29a.</li>
		<li>Before His coming back, Christ will have a wedding, uniting His overcomers to Himself as one entity&mdash;Rev. 19:7-9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ will marry the one who has been fighting the battle against God&rsquo;s enemy for years.</li>
			<li>In Revelation 19 Christ will marry the overcomers, who have already overcome the evil one.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>After His wedding Christ will come with His bride to destroy Antichrist:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Warrior is the Word, and His fighting will be the speaking of the word of God&mdash; v. 13:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) As the Lord fights, He speaks for God and expresses God.</li>
				<li>2) The Lord&rsquo;s fighting at Armageddon will be a powerful speaking.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The wedding garment&mdash;Christ lived out of us as our daily righteousness&mdash;qualifies us not only to attend the wedding but also to join the army to fight with Christ against Antichrist in the ultimate war&mdash; the war at Armageddon&mdash;Matt. 22:11-12; Rev. 19:7-8, 14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
