   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEANING OF BAPTISM Issue No. 19 Scripture Reading: Acts 22:16; Rom 6:3-4 THE MEANING OF BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we will consider a special subject: the meaning of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We will not spend any time to find out what baptism is and is not.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, we will specifically consider the meaning of baptism, the biblical teaching concerning it, and the emphasis in baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why does the Bible tell us that we should be baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we will ask why a person needs to wash himself in water.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He washes because his body is unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because there is dirt on his body or on his feet, he has to wash.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No one goes to the water to make himself unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Men go to the water to clean themselves; otherwise, they would not go into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, the first meaning of baptism according to the Bible is to be washed clean.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If one does not want to be clean, he does not have to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, when do we throw things into the water?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When do we throw a basket of manure or rubbish into the water?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We throw them into water when we do not want them, when we want to dispose of them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second meaning of baptism according to the Bible is to bury, to dispose of, something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we do not want something, we bury it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE WASHING AWAY OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have just read two passages of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What does Acts say?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Ananias was sent by the Holy Spirit, he saw a clear vision.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was told to rise up to meet Saul of Tarsus and say to him, "And now, why do you delay?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why do we have to be baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is the purpose of baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The purpose is to wash away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many people misunderstand this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some time ago, two brothers from Kiangsu came and asked me about this verse, saying, "This verse tells us to wash away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some have asked us if their sins are washed away if they are not baptized."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people have the same misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible clearly tells us to wash away our sins, but what does it mean?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible tells us that baptism is not a ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It tells us that being baptized is to bear witness before men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What do we do when we go into the water?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we go into the water, we are testifying before God, before men, before the angels, and before the devil that we have believed in Jesus, and that our sins are forgiven and washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Baptism is a confession before God, men, angels, and the devil that Christ has accomplished a real, complete, and reliable fact for us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Being baptized is showing and testifying to this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ananias told Saul to rise up and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why did he have to be baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was to wash away his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ananias was not saying that baptism can wash away sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Baptism itself cannot wash a man of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The thing that baptism testifies of and demonstrates is what washes away man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No water on earth can wash away any of man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the Lord's blood, testified of and demonstrated by the baptismal water, washes away all of man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Have you believed?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you have believed, you should rise up and be baptized immediately, washing away your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first meaning of baptism is to wash away sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brothers and sisters, no one who is filthy in God's eyes and whose sins are not yet forgiven can be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No one should be baptized who is ignorant of the fact that his sins are washed away and that he has eternal life and is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For such a one to be baptized is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every man who goes into the water must know what he is testifying of.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is a testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is seeing and testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In other words, it is testifying what one sees.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First one sees and then one testifies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those who have not seen anything cannot testify.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A man must know that his sins are forgiven and washed by the blood of the Lord before he can testify before men that his sins are washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From this we can see that infant baptism is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a person who is being baptized cannot testify, his baptism cannot be counted as a baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Any baptism performed on an unbeliever or on anyone before he believes is unreliable and means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only those who can testify that their sins are forgiven and washed away are qualified to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What a man does in the water is to testify to the accomplished works of Christ and that his sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Last Lord's Day we pointed out that as soon as a person believes, he knows if he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After a man knows that he is saved and that his sins are forgiven, what should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He should testify.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Where should he testify?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The first place to testify is in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This testimony is before God, before men, before the angels, and before the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is a testimony that one's sins are washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the first meaning of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is also the condition for baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If a person's sins are not washed away, he is not qualified to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He must fully know that his sins are forgiven before he is qualified to be baptized.</S>
