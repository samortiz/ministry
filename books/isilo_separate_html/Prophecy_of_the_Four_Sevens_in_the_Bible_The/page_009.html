Before the Three and a Half Years<br>of the Great Tribulation, the Overcomers<br>among the Believers Being Raptured into Christ's Presence (Parousia) in the Heavens</H2><P>Before the three and a half years of the great tribulation, the overcomers among the believers will be raptured into Christ's presence (parousia) in the heavens (Rev. 12:5-6; 14:1; Luke 21:34-36; Matt. 24:36-44).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. At the End (It Should Be in the Last Year)<br>of the Three and a Half Years of the Great Tribulation,<br>the Majority of the Believers, Both the Dead<br>and Resurrected and the Living, Being Raptured<br>into Christ's Presence (Parousia) in the Air</H2><P>At the end (it should be in the last year) of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, the majority of the believers, both the dead and resurrected and the living, will be raptured into Christ's presence (parousia) in the air (1 Thes. 4:16-17; Rev. 14:14-16; 2 Thes. 2:1, 3-4, 8). The New Testament clearly reveals that there will be at least two kinds of raptures. One is before the tribulation, and the other is after the tribulation. The one before the tribulation will be for the overcomers, and the one after the tribulation will be for the majority of the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) The Universal Woman,<br>Who Symbolizes the Majority of the Saints,<br>Being Nourished for Three and a Half Years<br>in a Place on the Earth Prepared by God<br>for the Living Saints Indicating and Proving<br>That the Majority of the Living Saints<br>Will Be Raptured after the Fulfillment of the Three<br>and a Half Years of the Great Tribulation</H2><P>The fact that the universal woman, who symbolizes the majority of the saints, will be nourished for three and a half years in a place on the earth prepared by God for the living saints (Rev. 12:6, 14), indicates and proves that the majority of the living saints will be raptured after the fulfillment of the three and a half years of the great tribulation; that should be in the last year of the three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Harvest,<br>Which Symbolizes the Majority<br>of the Living Saints, Being Reaped after the Worship<br>of Antichrist and His Image Also Indicating and<br>Proving That the Majority of the Living Saints<br>at the Lord's Coming Will Be Raptured<br>after the Great Tribulation<br>of Three and a Half Years</H2><P>The harvest, which symbolizes the majority of the living saints, being reaped (Rev. 14:14-16) after the worship of the Antichrist and his image (14:9-13) also indicates and proves that the majority of the living saints at the Lord's coming (14:14) will be raptured after the great tribulation of three and a half years.</P><P>During the time of the great tribulation, God will prepare a place to nourish His people who remain. This shows how kind our God is. This is similar to the way that the Lord took care of the children of Israel when they were in Egypt. God judged the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues, but the children of Israel were kept in a place called Goshen where they were covered, protected, and preserved.</P><P>These facts which will transpire prove that the majority of the saints who will not be matured before the great tribulation will be left on this earth to go through the time of the great tribulation. As we have pointed out, the earth at that time will be an unsuitable place in which to live. Those who have to pass through the time of the great tribulation will suffer something. The overcomers will have been raptured, and there will be many supernatural calamities. I believe it will be hard for the believers to love the world during that time. Do we believe that the Bible is the Word of God? We have to listen to all these things. My burden is not to teach prophecy. I am giving you a word of warning. Daniel's and John's hearts were on God. But where is our heart today?</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
