   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PURPOSE OF THE INCARNATION A. To Bring God into Man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The purpose of the incarnation is to bring God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is in us 1 John 4:15 , and we have to realize that the first step God took to get into us was to be incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, God was incarnated not only in Jesus but also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be saved is to have God incarnated in you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because incarnation brings God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before you were saved, you had nothing to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But since the day you believed into the Lord Jesus, God was incarnated in you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that God came into you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In human history, God never came into man until four thousand years after His creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was born into man to bring God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When God comes into a person through regeneration, the incarnation is repeated again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. To Make God Man That Man May Become God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>in Life and Nature but Not in the Godhead</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God in eternity past was God only, but in incarnation He was made man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He made Himself man that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may be able to say that we "become like God" in life and nature, but do we have the boldness to say that we "become God" in life and nature?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to see that we have been born of God, and we are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have you not been born of man?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then are you not man?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you are not man, then what are you?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the same way, since we are born of God and are the sons of God, are we not God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You are whatever you have been born of.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you have been born of Chinese, you are Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you have been born of Caucasians, you are Caucasian.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since we are born of God, we may say and even we should say that we are God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church fathers taught the truth concerning deification in the first four centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They pointed out clearly that deification means that the believers in Christ have been made God in His life and in His nature but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is the unique God for people to worship in His Godhead, but we are God only in life and in nature, not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all have to be clear that today we are God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Others should be able to sense that we are men plus something else.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They may not be able to pin down what we are, but they can sense that we have something more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, when we speak something concerning Christ, they all will realize that what we have as something more is Christ Himself, that is, God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the testimony of a God-man.</S>
