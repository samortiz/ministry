Finally, we would like to present what some prominent teachers in the past have said concerning this high peak of God's divine revelation
Athanasius one of the early church fathers said concerning Christ He was made man that we might be made God and The Word was made flesh
We may be able to say that we become like God in life and nature but do we have the boldness to say that we become God in life and nature
Since we are born of God, we may say and even we should say that we are God in life and nature but not in the Godhead
He is the unique God for people to worship in His Godhead, but we are God only in life and in nature, not in the Godhead
Eventually when we speak something concerning Christ they all will realize that what we have as something more is Christ Himself that is God
The sanctifying Spirit in God's sanctification first sought us out and then regenerated us, making us sons of God
We are not only the children of God, we are not only the sons of God, we are not only the heirs of God, but we are also the 'baby gods'
On the one hand, the New Testament reveals that the Godhead is unique and that only God, who alone has the Godhead, should be worshipped
God's redeemed people have become absolutely the very God in life, in nature, and in appearance, but not in His Godhead
All of God's redeemed people will eventually become gods as the very God in life, in nature, and in appearance but not in the Godhead
The New Jerusalem is the God-men who have been transformed, glorified, and mingled with the processed and consummated Triune God
A God-man is a man who is regenerated and transformed to be one with God, taking God as his life, his person, and his everything
The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God marries the bride as the consummation of the transformed, tripartite church
The marvelous thing is that through regeneration we have received God's life and nature to become the children of God, the sons of God
Now through the process of being sanctified we are being sonized that is we are being made God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead
Charges Brother Lee with espousing and propagating the greatest and worst blasphemous heresy the devilish heresy that man will become god
Never have the Godhead'-this crucial phrase deserves the attention of every honest reader of Brother Lee's materials
Whereas God and man may be the same in life and in nature they are not and never will be the same in the Godhead or as an object of worship
As quoted earlier, Brother Lee has taken the lead to declare that 'it is a great heresy to say that we are made like God in His Godhead'
John 3:2 tells us that when Christ appears, we, the children of God, 'will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is'
What he does say is this: 'Since we are the children of God, we shall be like Him in the maturity of life when He is manifested
In a passage quoted earlier, Brother Lee points out that 'when Christ comes, He will make us fully the same as God in life and in nature
According to his opinion, to be like God, who is light , is simply a matter of walking in the light as God is in the light
In John 8:12 Jesus declares, 'I am the light of the world,' and in Matthew 5:14 He says, 'You are the light of the world'
Is actually saying by evil insinuation and innuendo that Brother Lee wants to become God with the unique Godhead and as an object of worship
Is really doing here: He is categorizing Brother Lee not only with heretics and with Herod but even with Antichrist and with Satan himself
He comments on Barnabas and Paul at Lystra , Peter at the house of Cornelius , the old apostle John at Patmos , and the New Jerusalem
Not satisfied with falsely accusing Brother Lee by presenting a distorted and perverted account of his teaching, J
Attacks Brother Lee's person, calling him a heretic and a false apostle and classifying him with Antichrist and Satan
Such an accusation is not only untrue-it is ungodly, wholly unbecoming of a brother in the Lord and a servant of God
He may be depriving Gods children of the truth and hindering their entering into a life that is in keeping with the peak of Gods revelation
According to Revelation 22:18-19, adding to the Word of God and taking away from the Word of God are equally serious
May not only take away from the Word of God; he may also deny a crucial aspect of the teaching of the apostles
Remarks: 'The word of God never says that we, the believers, will at any time become little gods, baby gods, or mature gods
To be sure, the apostles did not teach that the believers can become God in the Godhead or as an object of worship
There is an intrinsic relation between the believers' becoming God in life and in nature and the producing of the New Jerusalem
If we read the Bible without paying attention to this crucial point, then, in a very real sense, the Bible is to us an empty book
Unfortunately, both claims fly directly in the face of what was taught in the church especially in its earliest centuries
Justin Martyr, a second-century apologist, is one of the earliest witnesses to explicitly teach that man may become God in God's salvation
In a later section we will show that the first clear formulation of the teaching that man becomes God in Gods salvation was that of Irenaeus
In his notable trilogy of apologetic writings we find at least one instance of such quotation in each of the three works
Accordingly this grace is indicated by the prophet, when he says, 'I said that ye are gods, and all sons of the Highest'
Being baptized we are illuminated illuminated we become sons being made sons we are made perfect being made perfect we are made immortal
For God did not only create us from nothing, but he also granted us by the grace of the Word to live a divine life
Ignores that such a distinction exists and, more outrageously, that such a distinction has been taught by Brother Lee
S attack is leveled at Brother Lee, but Brother Lee nowhere in his ministry appeals to these verses to teach that man becomes God
S comments amount to what is called a straw-man argument, whereby an opponent who does not actually exist is attacked and seemingly refuted
S condemnation should not be taken as merely against Brother Lee but even more so as against at least the teachers of the early church
As mentioned above, the first clear expression of this teaching can be found in the second-century writings of Irenaeus of Lyon
An even clearer statement of his view on man's becoming God is presented in an explanation of why the Word became flesh
Elsewhere in the same work Origen commends the Word of God as the practical means of being nourished by God and of thereby being made God
Thou shalt receive the kingdom of heaven, thou who, whilst thou didst sojourn in this life, didst know the Celestial King
Thou shalt be a companion of the Deity and a coheir with Christ no longer enslaved by lusts or passions and never again wasted by disease
For the Deity, does not diminish aught of the dignity of His divine perfection; having made thee even God unto His glory!
In other words, Athanasius challenged his Arian opponents with this question: If Christ were not truly God, how could He make us God?
A whole 'theology' of man becoming God can be surmised in Athanasius's repeated affirmations of this great truth
For this reason, the teaching that man becomes God became a basic view of salvation in the centuries immediately subsequent to the fourth
To say that this is heresy is to be sadly ignorant of the great history of this teaching in the long annals of the church
Pagan gods were made in the image and likeness of men, so to speak, somewhat fallen and given to the same vices we humans suffer
To become god, at the standard of these gods, was hardly an improvement over being mere man and hardly a great leap for humanity
The chasm between God and man, and particularly unsaved man, could not be as easily bridged as the emperor cult of Rome suggested
The process was called apotheosis in Greek and consecratio in Latin, and generally occurred after the death of the emperor
The man himself does not change at all, but his status is uplifted, and by this he gains the respect of the citizenry
For the early teachers of the church there were obvious 'contradictions' that could easily be found in the Scriptures
Paul says that God 'alone has immortality' , but elsewhere he declares that 'this mortal must put on immortality'
Peter 1:4 also presented problems, since our partaking of the divine nature strongly implies that we too can be said to be divine
These 'contradictions' invite us, as they did the early church, to surmise that in some sense man can be said to be God in God's salvation
As the centuries progressed the churchs teaching on deification was refined and by the fourth century reached a full stable and mature form
Perhaps the simplest way to present the distinction is to consider the term God as an answer to two questions: Who are you?
Peter 1:4 calls us 'partakers of the divine nature,' indicating that it is not our own nature that makes us divine but His
John tells us that Christ is life , but 'he who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life'
Uniquely He is the only begotten Son, but in relation to His believers He is the Firstborn among many brothers
As the many quotations from Brother Lee's ministry indicate, this distinction is clearly and forcefully held by us
Man will forever be endowed with the limited mental faculties he was given by creation; hence, he will never be omniscient
In God's creation there are species of living things, each bearing its own characteristics that distinguish it from other species
Adam before the fall was not a deified man; he was not created with God's life and nature but only with the capacity to receive these
The fall delayed the realization of what man was created for and brought in negative elements that required our redemption
Through Christ's salvation God's original intention for man is fulfilled, and man becomes God in life and nature though never in the Godhead
Says, 'Whether with big or small 'G' does not make any difference,' but there is significance to the use of each
That He is to be all in all means that God is to be everyone-Christ, the believers, the church fathers, Witness Lee, J
We are not alone today in our convictions, for great portions of the Christian community also believe and teach the same
The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods'
