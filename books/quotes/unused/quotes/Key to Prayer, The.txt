Even though some of the Lord's children spend time praying over many matters, they do not seem to get through in prayer
Some may do it without a problem; but others may do it awkwardly, bumping and banging it in a vain effort to get it through the door
The size of the table and the width of the door is the same; the only difference is with the people who are carrying the table
Once a person gets the key, he can do things twice as fast as others do, while those who do not have the key labor in vain
Many earnest Christians pray at great length; they pray wordy prayers, but they do not receive answers from God
When God made known to Abraham that He was about to execute judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah for their wickedness, Abraham waited before God
He did not beseech God with great intensity, saying, 'Oh, forbid that Sodom and Gomorrah should be destroyed'!
Some people may think that Abraham should have continued beseeching God and that he should not have stopped with just ten people
The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was the awful consequence of their sin, and it was the manifestation of God's righteousness
The men of Ai struck some of them about thirtysix men and they pursued them from before the gate unto Shebarim and struck them on the slope
The only thing that Joshua could do was to prostrate himself before God seek after God wait on Him and inquire into the cause of the defeat
To tolerate and hide one's sin is to cause God's name to be blasphemed and to give Satan occasion to attack God's people
Joshua did not just open his mouth in undiscerning zeal and plead with God to save His people and make them victorious once again
The dishonor that was brought upon God's great name grieved him, and his plea reminded God to take up the matter for His own name's sake
David did not simply open his lips and pray, 'O God, this famine has lasted three years; we beseech Thee to have mercy on us
The disciples seemed to be in sympathy with her because they said on her behalf, 'Send her away, for she is crying out after us'
Often we pray, yet our prayer seems to disappear like a stone dropped into the ocean; it goes away without any answer from God
We have not found the right key to unlock the door; however, we do not try to discover the reason that God has not answered our prayer
In all of our prayers we must first find the key; only as we do this can we expect to have constant answers from God
Unless our emotions are dealt with, it is impossible for us to pray; prayers will not have a way to be released
These are companies watching together, and together they discover something, and together they pray unceasingly to God
