   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE THE PRACTICE OF THE BODY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the practice of the Body life as it is presented in the closing chapters of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>SONSHIP FOR THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that we are to serve God in the gospel of His Son 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This gospel is a gospel of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sonship includes designation, resurrection, justification, sanctification, transformation, conformation, glorification, and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are presently undergoing the process of designation; that is, we are being designated sons of God by the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sonship is for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to be members of the Body of Christ, we must be sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have pointed out that, in a very real sense, chapter twelve is the direct continuation of chapter eight, with chapters nine through eleven as a parenthetical insertion regarding the selection of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapter eight reveals that we are being conformed to the image of the Son of God v. 29 . This conformation qualifies us for the practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Body life is not simply a matter of believers coming together.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many groups have been formed for the purpose of having the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The result, however, has been failure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These groups of believers did not realize that the Body life depends on sonship, which comes out of designation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are to have the proper practice of the Body life, we must be transformed according to the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE BODY PRESENTED, THE SOUL TRANSFORMED,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AND THE SPIRIT BURNING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In chapter twelve Paul mentions the body, the soul, and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 1 he says, I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our physical bodies must be presented to the Lord for His purpose of having the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Someone may have a heart for the Body life, but if he does not present his body, he is not for the Body life in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may care for the meetings, but what does this accomplish if your body remains at home?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we fail to present our bodies to the Lord for the church life, we cannot have a practical meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you say that you have a heart for the church meetings, you need to ask yourself if you have presented your body to the Lord for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Where is your body at meeting time?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The body is the container of our being, for the spirit is within the soul and the soul is within the body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must present this container to the Lord for the sake of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 2 speaks of the mind, which is the main part of the soul: And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When our mind is renewed, our soul will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, our body needs to be presented, and our soul needs to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this verse Paul beseeches us not to be conformed to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The world, Satan s system, is a cosmos composed of many ages.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The nineteenth century was one age, and the twentieth century is another age.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, there have been several distinct ages within the twentieth century itself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The present age is a section of Satan s world system.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This age includes not only the secular world, but also the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are conformed to today s religion, we shall be useless as far as the practice of the Body life is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For Paul in his day to be conformed to the present age was primarily a matter of being conformed to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Judaism was a serious hindrance to the practice of the Body life in the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Just as Judaism was part of the age in Paul s time, so Christianity as an organized religion is part of today s age.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are conformed to organized Christianity, you will be conformed to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead of being conformed to this age, we need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 12:11 Paul speaks of the spirit; he tells us to be burning in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our spirit must be fervent; that is, it must be burned and burning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have a body presented, a soul in the process of being transformed, and a spirit burning, we shall be able to practice the Body life in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>TALK AND PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many talk about the Body life in Romans 12 without the actual practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, some have seen that in the Body of Christ we are members one of another 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, they cannot name any members to whom they are specifically related.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, their word about being members one of another is mere talk.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are not here for talk about the Body life; we are for the practice of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The teaching in Romans concerning the Body life is in chapter twelve, but the practice is in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These chapters deal with practical problems that occur in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we consider Paul s approach to these problems, we can learn something related to the daily practice of the Body life.</S>
