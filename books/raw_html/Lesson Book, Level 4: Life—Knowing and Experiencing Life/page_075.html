<h1 class=msg>Lesson Twenty</h1><h1 class=msg>MAINTAINING A STRONG SPIRIT BY CALLING AND PRAYING</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>Acts 2:21; Rom. 10:12-13; Acts 9:14; 22:16; 2 Tim. 2:22; 1 Cor. 1:2; Psa. 116:2, 4, 13, 17; Isa. 12:2-4, 6; 1 Thes. 5:17; 1 John 1:7-9; Matt. 18:18-19; John 15:16</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The need to have a strong spirit</li><li>Calling on the name of the Lord	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Calling in the Old Testament</li>	<li>Practiced by New Testament believers</li>	<li>The purpose of calling</li>	<li>The way to call</li>	<li>The need of practice</li>	</ol></li><li>Praying to contact, to enjoy, and to fellowship with God</li><li>Praying to exercise God’s authority for God’s eternal purpose</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><p>In these remaining five lessons we will address the matters concerning the maintenance of life in our daily life and the church life. It is not enough just to know about life and know about how to experience life, we also need to know how to maintain the life that is in us.<h2 class=head1>I. THE NEED TO HAVE A STRONG SPIRIT</h2><p>The first thing needed to maintain the life that is in us is to have a strong spirit. When we were saved, our spirit was regenerated by the Holy Spirit of God. We have received God into us to be our life. Our dead spirit became alive. Hallelujah! From that point on, we need to maintain a strong spirit in order to maintain a healthy life level. Many Christians do not take care of their spirits. Their spirits have become like “flat tires,’’ having no sense of life nor direction from the anointing. They sin and do things of the world without any shame because their spirits are too weak. Right after we are saved, we must exercise our spirit every day to keep it strong.
