   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord Jesus Himself is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hence, when a man meets the Lord, he sees.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When a man meets the Lord, he falls and becomes weak as though he were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With many people, their old personality is stubborn and has never been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is useless for others to try to deal with their personality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is also useless for them to try to deal with it themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, once the Lord's light shines on them, they receive sight and become broken men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever a man sees the Lord, he becomes weak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever a man sees the Lord, he is broken and cannot survive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the meaning of light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brothers and sisters, we must never substitute any other thing for the light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What we usually speak of as light is not necessarily light itself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Most things are mere teachings and so-called truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They do not have any spiritual value to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once a brother who loved the Lord very much met a man who said to him, "I am very glad because I found the doctrine of sin in Romans."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the brother heard this he said, "Friend, did you only find the doctrine of sin in Romans today?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I think you should have found the reality of sin in yourself long ago."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people are looking for doctrines, but they have not found the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Doctrines are mere words, and they are death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are not light, they are not life, and they are not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the light comes, the first thing it does is kill.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not think that light only gives us sight.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, when the light comes, the first thing it does is to take away our sight.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The light makes us see, but that is a later result.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At first the light makes us blind and makes us fall; afterwards, we see.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anything that cannot make us fall to the ground is not the light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Anything that cannot humble us is not the light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul saw the light and fell to the ground, and his eyes could see nothing for three days Acts 9:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we first encounter light, we become confused.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When a person in darkness first sees light, he cannot distinguish anything; everything seems confusing to him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anyone who is self-assured and who thinks he knows everything needs God's mercy, because such a man has never seen the light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All that he knows are doctrines and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once he sees the true light he will say, "Lord, what do I know?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I know nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The greater the revelation, the blinder one becomes, and the more severe a blow one suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Light makes a person humble; it makes a person fall.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only after this will a person see.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we have never suffered any blow and never been humbled, and if we have never been confused and never felt that we knew nothing, we have never encountered any light, and we are still in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May the Lord have mercy on us so that His light may take away our self-assurance and so that we will not be so confident that we are right, that we are not wrong, and that we know so much.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May we say before the Lord, "Lord, You are the light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now I know that what I saw before was nothing but things."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Light is not something abstract; it is something very concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Lord Jesus was among us, He was light among us, the very light walking among us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What a pity that to some Christians so many things are abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They hear this and that doctrine, but everything is abstract to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They only know some abstract doctrines, but have not received any practical help.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One brother was studying in a parochial school when he was young.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He went to church often and heard the teaching concerning salvation many times.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet he had never met anyone who was saved, nor was he himself saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day he met a man preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When he heard the gospel the man preached, he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He had not been saved earlier because he had heard only abstract doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On that day, he met a genuinely saved person; he met something concrete, and he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One brother once related his experience of studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He said, "I had heard many brothers and sisters speaking on sanctification, and I went to study the doctrine of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I found more than two hundred verses about holiness in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I memorized them all and arranged them in proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet I still did not know what sanctification was; it was meaningless to me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then one day I met an elderly sister who was a truly sanctified person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On that day my eyes were opened, and I saw what sanctification is.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I met a person who was sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The light was so bright that it hurt; when it came there was no way for me to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The light showed me the meaning of sanctification."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>From these experiences we can see that light is something concrete, living, and effective.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you merely convey doctrines to others, the result will be merely doctrines in them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is dead, and this is not the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The light of life will shine in their lives and will shine out from them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must remember that with the Lord Jesus, light is something concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>With us, it is also something concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This light is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When this light appears, it is something living in us also.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Brothers and sisters, why does it seem as if God's Word has lost its power in these days?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Why does it appear so weak and abstract?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The only reason is that there are too many doctrines!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is too much "truth" and too much knowledge of theology!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have to realize that only the living Lord can produce living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>May the Lord truly have mercy on us to show us as the days go by that all things are dead and only the Lord is living.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In Christianity even the nicest looking things, the sweetest sounding things, and the things men consider most spiritual are dead if they are outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Lord Himself should be everything in us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He Himself is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Only He is living.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He is living in us, and when He is passed on to others, He will be living in them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we will prostrate ourselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we do this, we will know the Lord in a way different than we did before.</S>
