Recovering the Authority of the Church<br>to Deal with the Flesh</H2><P>In serving the Lord, on the one hand, the brothers and sisters have to learn to be obedient and to take the cross. Once the Holy Spirit operates, the cross will function within a person's heart. On the other hand, the authority of the church needs to be recovered; this deals with the flesh and deals with those who will not take the cross. In order for the work of the church to be recovered, there is first the need for the recovery of the one-talented ones. In order to recover the work of the church, there must also be the recovery of the authority of the church. It is not enough to recover the one-talented ones alone, and it is not enough to recover the authority of the church alone. If all the one-talented ones will rise up, in a short time we will be able to take over China. Who can withstand the mobilization of all the one-talented ones? If God will do this work among us, we will see an unprecedented work of salvation among us.</P><P>At the same time, the brothers and sisters have to learn to listen to others. If they do not listen, the church will fall into confusion. Naturally, the young and the new believers have many things that they do not know. The more advanced and mature brothers and sisters should exhort them to listen to others. We are people with a very small capacity. According to our disposition, we do things when we feel like doing them, and we go home and sleep when we do not feel like doing them. However, in the Body today, whether you like it or not, you have to do what you should do. Even if you have to cry with tears or sacrifice yourself, you still have to do it.</P><P>Co-workers, brothers, we have to receive something from the Lord. We cannot let anyone slip by. We cannot be so foolish in our work as to be unable even to tell the real believers from the false ones. We cannot leave a person alone for three to five months after baptism without rendering the proper care to him. We are our brothers' keepers. Those who do not act as their brothers' keepers are those who murder their brothers (Gen. 4:8-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Everyone Handing Over Himself, Everyone Working, and Everyone Submitting to Authority</H2><P>If we do these things, a church according to Pentecost will soon appear. If everyone hands himself over, if everyone is learning and working, and if everyone offers up his material riches and is obedient, we will have the proper coordination. I hope to see this situation not only in one or two places, but throughout the entire nation.</P><P>During the war, we had over four hundred co-workers among us. If the material supply had been adequate, we could have increased the number to a thousand. Whether in the east or in the west, most of the ones who are actually doing some kind of works are our brothers and sisters. In Chekiang, there are over ninety co-workers. In the one province of Fukien alone, we see God's blessings everywhere.</P><P>The foolish ones only see what they have in their hands; they do not have eyes for the whole earth. Today we have to enlarge our view. In China today, there are close to a thousand churches. But what is that to the Lord? We need tens of thousands of churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Everyone Needing the Training</H2><P>All the brothers and sisters in the church have to be trained. What we need today is not theology, but education in the things of God. When a local church is young, there is no way for the brothers and sisters to serve. But when a church is strong and rich, there will be much work. By that time, even if all the young saints put themselves into the work, there will still be a shortage of manpower.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_203.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_205.html">Next</a> </body></html>
