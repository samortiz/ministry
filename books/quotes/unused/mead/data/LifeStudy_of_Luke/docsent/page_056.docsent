   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Delivered from the Trend of This Age</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In today s world we face many perils perils of immorality, perils of anxiety, and perils of pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The more you desire to have pleasure, the more anxiety you will have, and the more you will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if you are willing to have a simple life, you will not have as many pleasures nor as many anxieties.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not follow the trend of today s world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This trend includes worldly traffic, pleasure, and anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of this trend, it is difficult for many to live a long life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the result of following the trend of the world, many are exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are busy with the worldly traffic and with earning money to have more pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The result is more anxiety, more disease, and more death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We Christians should be delivered from the trend of this age and take another way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not take the way of the world with its traffic, pleasures, and anxiety, our hearts will be released and available for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then our hearts will be occupied by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As an elderly person, I can testify that the secret to good health is taking Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because I take Christ as my everything I am released from the trend of this world, and my heart is free for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This makes it possible for Christ to grow within me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Parable of the Lamp</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 8:16 and 17 we have the parable of the lamp: Now no one having lit a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it underneath a couch; but he places it on a lampstand, in order that those who come in may see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For nothing is hidden that shall not become manifest, nor concealed that shall not by all means be known and become manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the parable of the sower, we need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the parable of the lamp, we need to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should shine brightly as a lamp without any covering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should be lamps in an open place shining so that others may be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we need to grow, and we need to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The lamp which shines light indicates that the Man-Savior s ministry not only sows life into His people, but also brings light to them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, such a divine ministry issues in the believers as luminaries Phil 2:15 and the churches as lampstands Rev 1:20 , shining in this dark age as His testimony, and consummating in the New Jerusalem with the outstanding characteristics of life and light Rev 22:1-2; 21:11, 23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Luke 8:18 the Lord says, Take heed therefore how you hear; for whoever has, it shall be given to him; and whoever does not have, even what he seems to have shall be taken away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This verse is concerned with how we hear the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Luke 8:18 is similar to Matthew 13:10-13 and Mark 4:25.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>IDENTIFYING HIS REAL RELATIVES</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Luke 8:19 says, And His mother and His brothers came up to Him, and they were not able to get to Him because of the crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When it was reported to the Lord Jesus that His mother and brothers were standing outside wanting to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He answered, My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s answer indicates that we can become the real relatives of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may become those who are truly related to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through His ministry the Man-Savior was making the believing sinners His spiritual relatives who became His many brothers Rom 8:29; Heb 2:11 in the house of God Heb 3:5-6 and His many members for the building up of His mystical Body Eph 5:30; 1 Cor 12:12 to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The most important matter in the parable of the sower is the word Luke 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to take care of the Lord s word in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we care for the word, we shall become the real relatives of the Man-Savior, and He will recognize us as such.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because we correspond to His word and make ourselves one with Him, He will identify Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the reason He says in 8:21 that His relatives are those that hear the word of God and do it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord lived a life according to the word of God, and now we also are living a life according to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we and He correspond, and there is an identification between us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 7:36-50 we see that we were sinners who have been forgiven through our faith in the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because our sins have been forgiven, we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The forgiveness of sins through faith and our love for the Lord issue in a life of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we live a life of peace, we follow the Lord and minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As those who serve Him, we need to grow in life so that the Lord may grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We also need to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The result is that we become the Man-Savior s real relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Paul s words, we become His members.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord s relatives are His members.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is the Head, and we are His members, the members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that we are the same as He is in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He lived the life of a God-man, and now we may live the same kind of life today.</S>
