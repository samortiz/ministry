<h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO<br />THE INNER LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>How do we know if this or that verse is the Lord's word to us? Every saved person has the Holy Spirit residing within him, and everyone can know God's leading. According to the promise of the New Testament, "I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them" (Heb. 8:10-11). There was a man who once wrote a book to oppose the trichotomy of the spirit, soul, and body. He thought that there was no need for such a distinction. Later, others asked my opinion concerning this subject. I said, "Even if the Bible did not say that man was of three parts, the Holy Spirit, who is in us, would tell us there is the distinction between the spirit, soul, and body." If the New Testament is the same as the Old Testament, why does the Bible need the New Testament? The Old Testament was inscribed outside of man, whereas the New Testament is a book inscribed in the heart, which touches on our inward condition. Actually, the One who inscribes into us is the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Today everyone can go and demand of God, saying, "I am Your sheep, and the sheep hears Your voice. Speak to me, and let me know Your will." There was a story about two men fighting over a sheep. They brought the matter to the magistrate, who asked the two men to call the sheep by name. When the real master called, the sheep responded. Today we have the Holy Spirit residing in us. He is our Lord; we have to hearken to His inner voice. I cannot make everyone clear concerning God's will, but the Holy Spirit is in us. He is much closer than I am; He is right within us. He can lead us. We only need to hear His voice.</p><p>The problem with the church today is that it only knows to search the Scripture and does not inquire of the Spirit within. If we only have the teaching of the Bible and do not have the inner leading of the Spirit, the Bible will be merely dead letters to us. The book The Assembly Life has been published, but a big question still remains whether or not we have the leading from the Spirit. If we try to practice The Assembly Life as if we were practicing the Ten Commandments and ignore the leading of the Spirit within, our meetings will be nothing but death. Once I saw a sister who blindly followed others to cover her head; she was not following the leading of the Spirit. When I saw this, I told her to take off her head covering. When a brother saw me, he asked why I told the sister to take the head covering off. I told the brother to ask the sister one question: Is she an Old Testament believer or a New Testament believer? An Old Testament believer obeys in an outward way; he only keeps the outward law. But a New Testament believer has the Spirit within him. Our life is one that walks according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. If we disobey the voice of the Spirit within, we are disobeying God. If the Spirit within has not ordered us to do something, and we do it, we are wrong in the eyes of God no matter how well we have done the work.</p><p>Suppose a brother wants to be baptized. If he does it only because the Bible says so, he is wrong. We must obey the Bible according to the Spirit. Every outward regulation and every human institution is a law. We must do everything according to the leading of the Spirit. What we need to do is to follow the inner leading. If we tell anyone to do something because the Bible says so, we are practicing the law. Unless the Spirit first works in a man, everything he does outwardly is of the law. Everything that does not originate from the leading of the Spirit is in the principle of the law. The Old Testament law was outside man, whereas the New Testament Spirit is inside man. May the Lord be merciful to us. We do not see much work of the Holy Spirit today because we do not honor Him and do not know Him. If we honor Him, know Him, and magnify Him, He can do great things among us. If we have the assurance from the Spirit to do a certain thing, we can be undeterred even if the whole world shakes its head. May we all follow the inner leading and not do anything without the inner leading. Obeying the inner leading in this way is true obedience. Only those who obey in this way will hear God's speaking, and only they will have the faith that substantiates all the spiritual things.</p>
