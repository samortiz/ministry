   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: Matt 3:1-2, 4; Rom 15:16; 12:1; Col 1:28; Rev 5:9-10a; 1 Pet 2:5; Matt 28:19; Heb 10:24-25; 1 Cor 14:26, 31 OUTLINE The Old Testament priest turning to become the New Testament priest Matt 3:1-2, 4: No longer offering bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead offering sinners in Christ Rom 15:16.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That the beloved saved ones may offer up themselves in Christ Rom 12:1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That the saints may be presented full-grown in Christ Col 1:28.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The universal priesthood of the New Testament Rev 5:9-10a; 1 Pet 2:5: Everyone preaching the gospel Matt 28:19.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone attending the home and group meetings Heb 10:24-25.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone prophesying for the Lord 1 Cor 14:26, 31.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have seen that God s ordained way always matches the nature of the things He desires to do and accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Testament, God has an excellent purpose which is to gain a group of sinners, whom, after saving them, He continues to separate, sanctify, and transform until they are one spirit with Him and become a people one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These ones become inseparable from God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only are they joined to God, they are even mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are simply a group of people that belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In their daily walk and through their expression, when men see them they see God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are the expression of God and are God manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason that God does all this is to gain a group of people who can win others to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only can they win others to God, they can offer these same ones to God as offerings, that is, as food for God that He may be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE OLD TESTAMENT PRIEST TURNING TO BECOME</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIEST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Old Testament, the duty and responsibility of a priest was to take the bulls and the goats to the altar and offer them up day and night as burnt offerings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These became food for God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were living sacrifices to God, satisfying God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All these were only types.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Testament, all the types are fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By now, what the priests of God offer as sacrifices are the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can see this turn in Matthew chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 1 says, Now in those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When John the Baptist came to fulfill his ministry he did not do it in the holy temple nor in the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, he went to a deserted wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There was no religious flavor nor any cultural background there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moreover, he had his garment of camel s hair and a leather girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey v. 4 . Leviticus 11:4 tells us that the camel is an unclean animal that cannot be eaten or touched.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But here was John who put on camel s hair.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only he himself was wild, but his food was wild also.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All this shows that he fulfilled his ministry in a wild way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did not abide by any of the old regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What he did was even more wild.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He preached, saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near Matt 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If anyone was willing to repent, he would baptize such a one into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The baptism at that time was unlike today s practice with a proper baptistry and changing rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John called for repentance, and group after group went out to him confessing their sins and were baptized by him in the River Jordan vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John did not fulfill his ministry according to the Old Testament way of worship at all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What he did was absolutely contrary to religion and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This shows that he completely rejected God s arrangement in the Old Testament in order that he might bring in God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But we must not forget John s family background.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not come from a wild family.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His father, Zachariah, was not only a priest Luke 1:5 , but one who took the lead in the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, John was born into a priestly family.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, his birth was of God Luke 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was given to his parents by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In addition, he was the firstborn who should have inherited his father s career to serve in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, he did not put on the priestly garments.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, he put on camel s hair.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He did not eat any priestly food.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, he ate locusts and wild honey.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Neither did he remain in the holy place burning the incense and dressing the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead, he went to the wilderness, baptizing people into water.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These were wild moves and methods.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It shows that the old way of worshipping God was over; a new way was introduced.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In reality John was the one who was serving as a true priest.</S>
