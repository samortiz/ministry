   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Transformed to Be a "White Stone"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>according to the Transformation in Life</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's work of building the church depends upon our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the overcomers, we need to be transformed to be a "white stone," justified and approved by the Lord, for the building up of the house of God, with a "new name" according to the transformation in life Rev 2:17b .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our natural being, we are not stones but clay.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we are being transformed from clay into precious stones for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The color white signifies justification and approval.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are transformed into a white stone, this means that we are justified and approved by the Lord for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some houses are made of adobe, but not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is built up with precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These precious stones are the believers who have experienced transformation upon transformation Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every transformed believer, as a white stone, bears a new name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a new name is the interpretation of the experience of the one who has been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, only he himself knows the meaning of that name.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We receive a new name by our new experience according to the transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Standing Strongly against</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>the Romish Teaching of Jezebel</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to be those who stand strongly against the Romish teaching of Jezebel, which is full of fornication, idolatry, and the deep things of Satan Rev 2:20, 24a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Romish teaching of Jezebel is the teaching of the apostate Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is clearly seen in the church in Thyatira in Revelation 2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Fleeing the Spiritual Death and Walking</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>in "White Garments" without Any Defilement</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have pointed out that with the church in Sardis in Revelation 3, everything is either dead or dying.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to be the overcomers, we need to flee spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to be those who live in reality with nothing dying in imperfection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the overcomers, we should walk in "white garments" without any defilement, so that our name will not be erased out of the book of life but confessed by the Lord before His Father and His Father's angels in the next age the kingdom age Rev 3:1-2, 4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To walk in white garments is to have a living that is unspotted by death and that is justified and approved in life by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Keeping the Lord's Word of Endurance</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>and Not Denying the Lord's Name</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>unto the Last Bit of Their Power</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The overcomers in Philadelphia keep the Lord's word of endurance and do not deny the Lord's name unto the last bit of their power, that they may be kept out of the hour of trial which is coming to try all those who dwell on the earth and that they may receive the crown of reward to be pillars in the temple of God with the name of God, the name of the city of God, the New Jerusalem, and Christ's new name written upon them Rev 3:8b, 10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The hour of trial will be the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For all of these points concerning the overcomers it would be helpful to study Revelation 2 and 3 with all the notes in the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we will be able to understand much more.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Being Hot instead of Being Lukewarm</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be hot, even burning, instead of being lukewarm, to buy gold refined by fire, white garments, and eyesalve, that we may not be spewed out of the Lord's mouth, but may be invited to dine with the Lord and to sit with Him on His throne Rev 3:15-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to be those who dine, who feast, with the Lord in this age so that we can sit on the throne with the Lord in the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To sit with the Lord on His throne will be a prize to the overcomer, that he may participate in the Lord's authority and be a co-king with Him to rule over the whole earth in the coming millennial kingdom.</S>
