   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPREADING THE FRAGRANCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:15 and 16 Paul goes on to say, For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing: to the one a savor from death unto death, to the other a savor from life unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apostles, being permeated with Christ, became a fragrance of Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They were not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself was the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God, both in those who were being saved, as a savor from life to life, and in those who were perishing, as a savor from death unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word rendered unto in verse 16 means resulting in. Therefore, unto death means resulting in death, and unto life means resulting in life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This refers to the different effects of the apostles ministry upon different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is a matter of life and death!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only the captives of God in Christ, who are saturated with Christ by the Spirit, are sufficient and qualified for this 3:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As captives and incense-bearers, the apostles scattered incense.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To some, this incense was unto death; to others, it was unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, these incense-bearers became a savor from life to life and from death to death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a description of Paul s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In his preaching of the gospel, Paul was spreading abroad the fragrance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever we speak Christ, this speaking is the spreading of the sweet fragrance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul also says that this is a sweet fragrance to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that when we speak Christ to others, in our speaking the fragrance of Christ ascends to God for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, to some, to those who are God s chosen ones, this fragrance will be life; however, to others this fragrance will be death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we speak Christ to others, we need to realize that our speaking is the spreading of the sweet fragrance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While we are speaking, God is enjoying this fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I doubt that many of us have realized that when we speak forth the riches of Christ in the meetings, we are spreading Christ as a sweet fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God enjoys this fragrance, for He is happy to be able to enjoy our speaking of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have seen that in chapter two Paul says that God is always leading us in triumph in the Christ and manifesting through us the savor of the knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is to speak Christ with our spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, the apostles were a fragrance of Christ to God because they were saturated and permeated by Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because they were permeated in this way, they became the fragrance of Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When they spoke to others, the very Christ of whom they were constituted spread Himself forth out from their being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because they were full of Christ, they became the fragrance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they spoke, the Christ of whom they were constituted came forth as a sweet fragrance to God for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This should also be our experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While we are speaking Christ, He should come forth as a sweet fragrance out from our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God enjoys this fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once again, this is a matter of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From experience we know that whenever we give a genuine testimony for the Lord, we are the first to enjoy this testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the meeting we may be filled with praise to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, we also know what it is like inwardly when we do not obey the inner sense to speak for the Lord in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In such a case, we may feel deeply disappointed and deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a difference it makes to speak for the Lord in the meetings!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some saints may not speak because they are afraid of saying something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not be held back by this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes we are happy in the Lord even though we may have made some kind of mistake in our speaking, for we still spread forth Christ in our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have seen that God has attached all of us firmly to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have been linked to Christ, and Christ has been linked to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, Christ is one with the Spirit, and the Spirit is one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the Triune God is joined to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now when we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord serves, and God operates.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity we can mature in life and triumph in our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all can have a triumphant ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we open our mouths to speak for Christ, we shall be triumphant.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can allow Christ to spread His sweet fragrance to God for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This fragrance will also have an effect on others, either to life or to death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All this takes place by God s dispensing, by the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our being.</S>
