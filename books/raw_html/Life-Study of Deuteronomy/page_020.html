<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF DEUTERONOMY</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A REVIEW OF THE PAST</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Deut. 4:1-40</H1><P>From Genesis to Revelation, the entire Bible does three things: it manifests God, exposes man, and unveils Christ. Before considering further the matter of a review of the past, I would like to give an additional word on these three functions of the Bible.</P><P>First, the Bible shows us what kind of God we have. In the Bible God is manifested as the loving, righteous, and faithful God. Further, in the Bible we see that God is a God who blesses. God's heart is loving, His hand is righteous, His mouth is faithful, and His eyes are mainly for blessing. This is our God.</P><P>Second, the Bible exposes man. The Bible is the only book which shows us man's real condition. When we come to the Bible, we see ourselves. The Bible exposes us and shows us that we are nothing, that we have nothing, and that we can do nothing. In other words, we are a zero. Actually, this is what God wants, for He does not want us to be anything in ourselves. This is the reason Paul tells us that he has been crucified with Christ (Gal. 2:20). In His economy, in His plan and divine arrangement, God wants us to be crucified. This means that He wants us to be nullified, to become a zero.</P><P>Third, the Bible unveils Christ. Christ is hidden, mysterious, and abstract; no one can know Him. But the Bible unveils Him to us.</P><P>We have pointed out that the entire Bible is implied in the book of Deuteronomy. We may also say that Deuteronomy is an extract of the Bible. The Bible as a whole manifests God, exposes man, and unveils Christ, and the book of Deuteronomy, as an extract of the Bible, also manifests God, exposes man, and unveils Christ.</P><P>Let us now go on to consider some further matters related to a review of the past.</P>
