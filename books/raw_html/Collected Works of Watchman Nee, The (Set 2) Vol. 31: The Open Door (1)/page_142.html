<h2 class="head2">The Travels of Sister Yu-bing, Fukien Province</h2><p>Greetings to Sister Lee in the Lord:</p><p>Indeed the Lord has saved many people through sufferings. I went south to Yen-Ping on the fifth of this month. I stayed for a week and fellowshipped with the sisters. On the twelfth I took a steamboat for nine and a half hours to Hung-Shan near Foochow. Thank the Lord for giving me a good opportunity to testify for Him to my family, relatives, and neighbors. We had a total of five days of meetings. I spoke nine times and finished only this afternoon. May the Lord cause these word-seeds to fall into the soil of good hearts that they may grow and bear fruit to the glory of the Lord's name. Amen. I have been away from Fukien for four years. On the trip home I have done my best to visit the brothers and sisters in the Lord. My heart is very happy. Tomorrow I will go to Yung T'ai. I plan to go to Min-Ching at the end of the month. If the Lord is willing, I will then go north to Xia-Yang, Yang-Kou, Shun-Chang, and Shao-Wu. Please help me with your prayers. Thank the Lord. I am well and am very interested in the work. I am always learning some lessons. These experiences will teach me more about how I must serve the Lord in eternity. Shao-yun and Chia-en continue their studies as usual. Although I travel from place to place, they are all safe under the Father's care, so I do not have any distractions. Praise the Lord! Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Liao Ong Yu-bing<br />April 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Taishan, Kwangtung Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>On March 24 God the Father led senior Mrs. Nee, Mrs. Tseng Wen Feng-chi, Sister Lei Wei-rong, and me to leave Hong Kong. We traveled safely the entire way to Taishan. The day after we arrived, we prayed, and God gave us the word in Joshua 5:14: "As the Captain of Jehovah's army...I now come." Thank the Lord! He was the captain of the ten-day conference. There was a prayer meeting and edification meeting every morning from March 17 to April 5. Senior Mrs. Nee was the main speaker. The Holy Spirit worked every day. Mrs. Nee worked in Taishan for seventeen days. She and Sister Wei-rong then went to Hong Kong on the eleventh. Mrs. Tseng and I are staying temporarily for the work. We do not know when we will go. May you remember us often before the throne.</p><p>Your sister in the Lord, Lin Wei-shi<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Last month the Lord led Mrs. Nee Wen-shiu (senior Mrs. Nee) to Taishan. The Lord used her greatly to work in Taishan. Spiritual truths were released through her. Every day cold sisters were revived. The Holy Spirit was poured out every day. One elderly sister, Mrs. Chen, had a hunchback and walked with difficulty. Mrs. Nee prayed for her, and she became straight immediately. This was really a great miracle. We should give glory to God. Mrs. Tan, who did not know how to read, can now read some characters and has learned to sing some hymns. Mrs. Lin, who had tuberculosis, is now completely healed. Several others were healed as well. God used miracles and wonders in Taishan to prove His power and strength. The name of the Lord Jesus was exalted and sinners repented during this time of gospel preaching. The Lord Himself did everything. Glory be to Him!</p><p>Your sister, Lei Wei-rong<br />April 19<br />[Address omitted]</p>
