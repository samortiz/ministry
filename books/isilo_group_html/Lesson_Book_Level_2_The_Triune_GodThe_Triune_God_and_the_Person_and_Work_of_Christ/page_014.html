We hope you have seen something and are experiencing Him more in your daily life. In the next six lessons we want to see how the whole Bible tells us about the Triune God. Certainly we cannot cover everything in the Bible in six lessons, but we will mention some of the crucial points. </P><P>The structure of the entire Bible is just the Triune God and His full salvation. God is triune in His dealing with man, saving of man, and dispensing of Himself into man. By this, man may become His sons and members of the Body of Christ. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE TRIUNE GOD IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><P>You should know that the Old Testament tells about God and His chosen people before the birth of Christ. The New Testament begins with the birth of Jesus. Do not think, though, that we cannot see the Father, Son, and Spirit in the Old Testament. In fact, the Old Testament is full of the Triune God for our experience; it is just that He is still somewhat hidden and presented in symbols. But what is often very hard to describe with words can be understood much better by seeing a picture. This is true of the Triune God. With the help of the New Testament to explain the pictures in the Old Testament, we will see how excellent and experiential our God is.</P><P>The first sentence in the Old Testament states, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Gen. 1:1). In the Hebrew language the subject "God" is triple in number, whereas the verb "created" is singular in number. This means that God is three-one. From the very first verse of the whole Bible, we see that God is triune!</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 2: The Triune God-The Triune God and the Person and Work of Christ &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
