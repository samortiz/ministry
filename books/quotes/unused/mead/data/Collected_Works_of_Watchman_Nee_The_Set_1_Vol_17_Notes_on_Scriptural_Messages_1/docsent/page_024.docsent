   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REDEEMING THE TIME A Transcript of Lord's Day Meeting, Given in Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>on January 13, 1931</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Issue No. 13 Scripture Reading: Gal 6:10; Eph 5:16; 4:27; Rom 13:14</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today is the first Lord's Day of the new year.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, let us listen to what the Bible has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even though we do not care about the so-called new year, we should have a new impression whenever a new year comes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though to a Christian the new year is nothing, we should always have a new beginning whenever a new year comes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament there is also the record of the new year.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, in the Old Testament the month and the day for the beginning of the new year were ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, today we want to consider this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether or not you are a Christian, as the years pass by, do you have any special feelings or impressions, or do the years mean anything special to you?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I do not know what you think, but for me, every year means a little more opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To lose the opportunity is to miss the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today, whether or not you are a Christian, the first question to ask yourself is whether you have missed your opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One proverb says, "Opportunity enters by the door, but flies out through the window."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is true.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have to open the door to invite the opportunity to come in, but it can go out without waiting for you to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, for those who are here, if you are not saved, you should seek the opportunity to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you are already saved, you should seek the opportunity to serve the Lord; you should seek the opportunity to love others, and you should seek the opportunity to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have just read the phrase, "redeeming the time" Eph 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Redeeming in the original text means "buying back."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers and sisters, God gives us time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is like capital to a businessman.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Time is our capital.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps year after year you have done many things which are excellent, or perhaps year after year, as a businessman who has suffered loss, you have just been wasting your time away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps some have had few opportunities but they have accomplished much, or some have had many opportunities yet they have not accomplished anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, this year we have to redeem our time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has given us time and expects us to make good use of it in the same way that businessmen make good use of their capital.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May we all use our time properly, and may we not allow it to pass by vainly and to become wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Galatians 6:10 says, "So then, as we have the opportunity, let us do what is good toward all, but especially toward those of the household of the faith."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever there is the opportunity, we should do good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should take care of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If there is no opportunity, obviously there is no way to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, when there is the opportunity, there is no more excuse for us not to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we shall briefly look at a few things which we should seize the opportunity to do:</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I. SEEKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOVE OUR LORD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brothers and sisters, do you remember the woman in Mark 14 who poured ointment from an alabaster flask on the head of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regarding this event, the Lord spoke well of her in this way, "And truly I say to you, Wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her" v. 9 . Why did she do this? The Lord said, "She has anointed My body beforehand for the burial" v. 8 . Oh, some disciples thought that Mary was too foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why this waste?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why not use the three hundred or more denarii to give to the poor?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What did the Lord say?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He said, "For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But you do not always have Me" v. 7 . The Lord meant that one has the opportunity to help the poor every day but that there would not always be an opportunity to anoint Him because He was going to die.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once today's opportunity is missed, there cannot be another opportunity of today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The year 1931 is the year 1931.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Next year will not be the same as this year.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today is today; tomorrow is not today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord is coming back soon!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whatever you can do for the Lord today, you should do it while there is still today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By the time you come before the Lord and meet Him face to face, it will be too late to turn back to do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Who can say that the Lord Jesus will not come this year?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who can say that the Lord Jesus will not come today?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Perhaps the Lord will come today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps today is the very last opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, we should consecrate to the Lord today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is only today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On that day when you meet the Lord, even if you had ten thousand hearts, you would surely give all of them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even if there were ten thousand worlds, you would gladly forsake them all.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But it would be too late, for you would have missed your opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You should serve the Lord while you still have the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why is there a difference between the five foolish virgins and the five prudent virgins in Matthew 25:2?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is the difference between the prudent and the foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They bore the same name virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The oil was the same; they all took lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Their goal was the same, which was to go forth to meet the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They heard the same cry; they arose the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What was the difference between them?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Perhaps some would say that the foolish ones took the lamps but did not prepare the oil; the prudent ones took the lamps and also prepared the oil in the vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No doubt this is true, and I have not forgotten this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But I would say that the foolish ones also prepared the oil in the vessels; only they went to buy it later v. 10 . What is the main difference between them? This difference is that the five prudent virgins had their oil beforehand, before the coming of the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The five foolish virgins had their oil afterward, after the coming of the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There was oil, but it was bought after the bridegroom had come; the time had already passed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The question is not one of having or not having but one of timing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Time is a big question.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The foolish ones are the ones who lose the opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A certain believer gave a gospel tract to an unbeliever in the park.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>That person, after reading it, said that it was something of Christianity and was sheer nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This believer told him, "Even though today you do not believe in this, there will be a day when you have to believe that this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>By the time you go to hell, you will believe.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Everyone in hell believes, but the believing will come too late."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What he said was true.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Furthermore, the same is true for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is not that things are not done, but that they are done too late.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>An unbeliever can lose his opportunity, and a believer can also lose his opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I remember a story which goes something like this.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There was a certain young man who had just started in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He prayed that God would give him a vision so that he would know how to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He had a dream in which he was advanced in years and was being judged in front of God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God said that on a certain day, at a certain time, he should have gained many people, but that he let the opportunity go and not many people were saved, and that on another day, at another time, he should have preached to a certain person, but that he let the opportunity go and did not preach.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God said further that on yet a third certain day at a certain time, he should have done good to a certain person, but that he let the opportunity go again and did not do so.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In every case, it was concerning a certain day and a certain time in which something should have been done, but the opportunity was missed.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The believer then asked God for another opportunity to make up for this lack.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>At this point he woke up.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He was relieved that this was only a dream and that everything was not over.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Oh, if there can be any regret in heaven, the only regret will be the loss of opportunity!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If there will be regret in hell, the only regret will also be the loss of opportunity!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Oh, when a sinner misses his opportunity, he will not be saved!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When a believer misses his opportunity, he will not be able to serve the Lord fully!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Only one week has passed by this year.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Fortunately, there are still fifty-one weeks left.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>May we all not miss the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>There is a custom in Italy that when a girl is married, she receives a pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Every year on the first day of the first month, she must go to pick a rose and put it in this pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When she dies, this pocket full of roses will become her pillow in the coffin.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The sweet scent of the roses collected throughout the years is thought to remain fragrant for her for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>As we go through life day after day, we should also pick our roses, so that their sweet scent will remain with us for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We should redeem our time and not lose our opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If you are not a Christian and allow your days to pass by one after another, there will surely be a day when you will regret that you have not been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If you are a Christian and allow your days to pass by one after another, there will surely be a day when you will regret that you have not served the Lord fully.</S>
