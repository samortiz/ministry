   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Life Being the Light of Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 1:4 says, In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is absolutely true that the life is the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, receiving Him into us, the divine life came into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Immediately we had the sense of something shining within, but perhaps, at that time, we did not have the language or the utterance to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That shining was the shining of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because life shines, the life is the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shining is the strongest confirmation that we have been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Word is heard and the life is received, the life becomes the light shining within to enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God, as the divine life, shines within us as the light of life, we are under His enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Being born of God by receiving His Word, we have God as our life, and this life becomes the light within us shining all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord is the Word of God, the expression of God by which we may know God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we receive Him as the expression of God, He becomes our life, and this life becomes the light that shines within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 5 says, And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Darkness can never overcome or extinguish light, but light dispels darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the light of life shines within us, darkness can never overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, this light is the true light which enlightens every man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word enlightens in Greek is the same word used in the same way as in Ephesians 1:18; 3:9 and Hebrews 6:4; 10:32.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It refers here to the inward enlightening which brings life to the ones who receive the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the old creation, it was the physical light Gen 1:3-5, 14-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For the new creation, it is the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Life also becomes the authority for the believing ones to be the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The birth described in these verses is not the natural birth which we had through our parents; it is the second birth which occurred when we believed in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Believing in the Lord is equal to receiving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I speak of receiving the Lord Jesus, you may say that you have never done that.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, I want to ask you a question: Have you not believed in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When you heard His name, did you not believe in it?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a person truly believes in that dear name, I am certain that, in some way or other, he will say, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As long as you say His name from the depths of your being, it means that you believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you believe in Him by calling on His name, it is proof that you have received Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And since you have received Him, you have received the authority to become a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is this authority?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is Christ Himself as life to you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ as life is simply the Spirit of sonship, and this Spirit of sonship makes you God s child.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You can know that you are a child of God by two things: by the fact that you believe in Him and call on His name, and by the fact that, at times, you spontaneously and sweetly cry, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you can call God Abba, Father in such a sweet way, it proves that you are His child.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As verse 13 declares, this birth is not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Blood Gk., bloods here signifies the physical life; the will of the flesh denotes the will of fallen man after man became flesh; the will of man refers to the will of man created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we became a child of God, we were not born of our physical life, our fallen life, or our created life we were born of God, the uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For human beings to become children of God is for man to have the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why has God brought forth so many children?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not mainly because He loves us or because He has pity on us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although He loves us, the purpose of His begetting so many children is for His multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God loves to be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every father has some multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before God brought us forth, He was merely God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He could look at Himself and say, Here I am by Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am almighty, omniscient, and omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am everything, but I am alone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now, after generating so many children, God can say, Behold My multiplication!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Throughout all the centuries and generations God has been multiplying Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the beginning was the Word and in Him was life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Through creation He prepared many receivers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today, these receivers have become God s multiplication, and this multiplication has become the increase and corporate expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is fully expressed through His children as His increase and corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God originally had only one Son, His only begotten, as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That expression may be called the individual expression.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now God, through the multiplication of His life, has many sons as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This expression may be called the corporate expression, which is composed of His Son, who has now become His firstborn, and His many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is one of the main aspects of the revelation of this book.</S>
