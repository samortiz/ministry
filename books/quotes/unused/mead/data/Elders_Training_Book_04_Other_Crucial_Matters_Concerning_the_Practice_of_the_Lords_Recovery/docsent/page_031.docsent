   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE RECEIVING OF THE SAINTS 1 RECEIVING ALL THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How we receive all the saints determines whether or not we are a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Merely to say that we are standing on the ground of oneness is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should stand on the ground of oneness, yet we must have some governing conditions and terms.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first governing condition is how to receive the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In principle, we must receive all of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is fully covered by the Apostle Paul in Romans 14 and 15.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul tells us that we have to receive all kinds of believers surely he means the real believers who may be different from us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if there are believers that still keep the Sabbath and that still eat the Jewish religious diet, there is no ground for us to reject them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we reject them, we become a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One of the basic constituents by which any group of Christians is constituted to be a denomination is that they only receive the saints according to their kind of taste or their kind of belief.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Southern Baptists insist on baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With them, you even have to be baptized by immersion in their water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are baptized by others in others' water, they do not recognize this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a strong sect with millions of members.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Their numbers, however, do not justify them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Numbers do not justify anyone, but their practice does.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to receive everyone whom Christ has received Rom 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Practicing According to the Proper Principle and According to God's Love</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some may say that we have to receive the genuine believers because some believers are not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to be very careful, however, in saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must realize that we cannot discern things to a full extent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is true that we only receive the genuine believers, but we may make a mistake in this matter of discerning who is a genuine believer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, here is a person who prays and says he believes in the Lord Jesus, yet to your feeling this one has not been genuinely regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, you would insist on keeping the principle that we only receive the genuine believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The three other elders whom you coordinate with, though, may feel that this man is saved because he believes in the Lord Jesus, he confesses his sins, and he prays to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To make a decision in this case by voting surely is not the way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must learn two things: first, to keep the principle of receiving the genuine believers, and second, not to trust that any single person's feeling is one hundred percent right; we must practice the principle of the Body to have at least two or three to make the final decision by exercising their spirit 1 Cor 2:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A certain person, according to your feeling, might not be genuinely regenerated, yet he may be truly regenerated in fact.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>None of us should be overconfident to insist on his own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When all of us are not sure in our feeling concerning the genuineness of anyone's regeneration, we should make a positive decision according to God's love, as long as this one assures us that he believes in the Lord Jesus, confesses his sins, and prays to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to my experience over the years, when we practiced according to God's love in receiving ones concerning whom we dare not say definitely whether or not they are truly regenerated, our receiving was right most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such persons sometimes became very good brothers.</S>
