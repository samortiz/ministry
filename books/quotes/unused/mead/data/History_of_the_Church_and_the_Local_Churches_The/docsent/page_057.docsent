   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Two Aspects of Brother Nee's Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ and the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Nee's ministry was clearly of two aspects Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His ministry was a fully, properly, and adequately balanced ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through my reading and knowledge of church history, I have come to know something concerning the lives of many famous spiritual persons from the first century to the present.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I never saw a person like Brother Nee who was so adequately and thoroughly balanced with these two aspects Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He really saw the vision of Christ, and he also received the revelation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His publications were always on Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They were properly balanced see pages 5 and 6 of the foreword to The Orthodoxy of the Church published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He published many books concerning Christ as life and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The reality, or the content, of the church is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He also published many books on the practice, the practicality, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother Nee's ministry on Christ was not for the believers individually.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The vision of Christ which Brother Nee received for his ministry was of Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many so-called spiritual people teach about Christ for the Christians individually.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In their teaching they do not care for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are even afraid to speak about the church because they realize that this will cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To stay away from these problems, they just take care of Christ for the believers' individual life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother Nee was different.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The vision he received was concerning Christ as the believers' life and everything for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Christ whom the believers experience is the reality, the content, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to match this reality, the practicality of the church is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The reality of the church is the content.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The practicality of the church is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is not merely for the individual Christians but for the corporate Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His being for the individual Christians is for the building up of His corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church's reality is Christ being realized by us individual Christians in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To match this reality, we need the practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot hold Christ as the reality in an individual way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must come out of our private interests and come together with Christ as the reality to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we can testify, even to God's enemy, that we are one and that we have not only the reality but also the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ and the church were the main points of Brother Nee's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have realized what Brother Nee's ministry is to such an extent by reading his books and by being with him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I thank God and praise the Lord that I had the privilege of listening to his messages, of having personal, direct talks with him, and of seeing how he conducted himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I initially read some of his articles in 1925, I thought he must be an old, experienced man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, I found out that he was a very young man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time he was twenty-two years old and I was twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I first came into contact with him by reading his publications.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, I read all of Brother Nee's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I also edited many of his messages.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I was assigned to edit one of his three series of editions of The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Beginning in 1934 the main messages in that magazine were from Brother Nee, but I did the editing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, I had the privilege of reading all these writings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His writings show that his ministry was of two aspects Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is the reality, the content, of the church, and the church needs the practicality to match the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1923 Brother Nee published his first magazine called The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His second magazine, The Christian, began to be published in 1925 and continued for two years through 1926.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After 1926 Brother Nee began to publish The Present Testimony again for about seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Present Testimony was mainly on the side of Christ being life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It presented the revelation of the person and work of Christ, the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>That was the deepest spiritual publication in all of Christianity at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Christian mainly covered things for young Christians, for new beginners.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 1934 Brother Nee had the burden to publish The Christian again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By that time I was in the work, so he gave the editing responsibility to me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From that year he took care of The Present Testimony, and I was charged to take care of The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Besides this he published many books on both Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His ministry was composed of Christ and the church.</S>
