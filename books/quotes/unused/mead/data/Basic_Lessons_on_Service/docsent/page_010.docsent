   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHURCH MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second category of meetings is the church meetings, and the first meeting of the church which we need to consider is the Lord's table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. The Lord's Table Meeting 1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the First Day of the Week the Lord's Day</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acts 2 tells us that the early believers had the Lord's table, the breaking of bread, every day in their homes vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>42, 46 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later in Acts 20:6b-7a, we can see that the saints had a habit of having the Lord's table on the Lord's Day, the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 6b says that the apostle Paul and his co-workers stayed in Troas for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the next verse says that on the first day of the week they had the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This strongly indicates that by that time the Lord's table was conducted mainly on the Lord's Day, the first day of the week, the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to say a little word here about the difference between the Lord's Day and Sunday.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sunday is a heathen, idolatrous term adopted by Catholicism and maintained by our tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, it is idolatrous to say a day belongs to the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible refers to this day as the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Revelation 1:10 calls this day "the Lord's Day."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must respect the first day of the week as a memorial of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should consider this day as a day of the Lord and for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today the whole world takes Sunday not mainly for worship but for pleasures, for sports, and for all kinds of entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is more evil than idol worship, but this tide has flooded many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many Christians not only refer to the Lord's Day as Sunday, but also consider Sunday as a day of pleasure and entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We, however, should consider the first day of the week as a day for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In ancient times, the saints eventually had the Lord's table on the Lord's Day, the first day of every week.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is also proved by 1 Corinthians 16:2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this verse the apostle Paul told the saints that on the first day of each week, they should offer something of their material possessions to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This proves that on the first day of each week, the early saints met together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today the best day for the Christians to meet together is the first day of the week, the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must make this clear to the saints.</S>
