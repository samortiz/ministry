We may talk a great deal about Christ, but in our daily living we may not actually be in Christ. Instead, we may be in our culture, national philosophy, or domestic logic. When we are in the church meetings or with the saints, we may have a lot to say about Christ. But in our daily life we may live in our national philosophy, domestic logic, or family concept.</p><p>During the years we have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have come to know that the Lord is the all-inclusive Spirit and that we are one spirit with Him. The Lord is now the Spirit dwelling in our spirit. Although we know this as a doctrine, in our daily life much of the time we do not live one spirit with the Lord. Instead, we often live in our culture. We may pray, &ldquo;Lord, we thank You that You are the life-giving Spirit and that we are one spirit with You.&rdquo; Nevertheless, day by day we do not live Christ moment by moment. We do not practice being one spirit with Him all the time.</p><p>Recently the Lord has pointed out to me my shortage in living Christ. Most of the confession I make to Him is related to this lack. Day by day, I spend too little time living one spirit with the Lord. Too much of the time I live in something other than Christ, in many good things that are not Christ Himself. Because this is our situation, all of us need the Lord to have mercy on us.</p><p>Both we and the Lord have come to a point of crisis. A critical situation definitely exists among many of us today. Yes, we have seen the vision that Christ is our life, that He is the life-giving Spirit, and that we are one spirit with Him, and we talk a great deal about Christ. However, in our practical life day by day, we do not live Christ every moment. We are not found by others in Christ continually. We may be very familiar with 3:7-10. But how much have we gained Christ, how much are we found in Christ, and how much do we experientially know Christ? Because of our urgent need to experience Christ, it is not my burden in these messages to present Bible teachings. It is to minister Christ to the saints that they may grow in the divine life, which is Christ Himself, and may advance in the experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING CHRIST<br />IN THE POWER OF RESURRECTION</h2><p>In verse 10 Paul says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His suffering?, being conformed to His death.&rdquo; According to this verse, Paul aspired not only to know Christ, but also to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings. The power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is His resurrection life which raised Him from among the dead (Eph. 1:19-20). The reality of the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is the Spirit (Rom. 1:4). To know, to experience, this power requires identification with Christ&rsquo;s death and conformity to it. Death is the base of resurrection. To experience the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, we need to live a crucified life according to the pattern of His life. Our conformity to His death affords a base for the power of His resurrection to rise up that His divine life may be expressed in us.</p><p>The participation in Christ&rsquo;s suffering&mdash;&ldquo;the fellowship of His sufferings&rdquo;&mdash;(Matt. 20:22-23; Col. 1:24) is a necessary condition for the experience of the power of His resurrection (2 Tim. 2:11) by being conformed to His death. Paul was pursuing to know and experience not only the excellency of Christ Himself, but also the life power of His resurrection and the participation in His sufferings. With Christ, the sufferings and death came first, followed by the resurrection. With us, the power of His resurrection comes first, then the fellowship of His sufferings and conformity to His death. We first receive the power of His resurrection. Then by this power we are enabled to participate in His sufferings and live a crucified life in conformity to His death. Such sufferings are mainly for producing and building up the Body of Christ.</p><p>Being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death is the very base of the experience of Christ. If we are not conformed to the death of Christ, we do not have the base for the experience of Christ. In order to experience Christ, we must be conformed to His death. But to be conformed to the death of Christ, we must have the fellowship of His sufferings. By participating in Christ&rsquo;s sufferings, we are ushered into a position to experience the power of His resurrection. Then, when we experience the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, we know Him.</p><p>In Philippians 3 the sequence is knowing Christ, knowing the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, knowing the fellowship of His sufferings, and being conformed to His death. But in our spiritual experience, the sequence is reversed. Daily we are conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death; then we participate in His sufferings, know the power of His resurrection, and, by knowing the power of resurrection, we know Christ Himself. According to Paul&rsquo;s sequence, first we receive the excellency of the knowledge of Christ by seeing the vision of Christ; second, we count all things to be refuse; third, we gain Christ and are found in Him; and fourth, we know Christ, experience Him.</p><p>In order to experience Christ, we must be in the power of resurrection. We cannot be in our natural life. The more we know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the more we shall participate in the sufferings of Christ and thereby have the fellowship of His sufferings. If we experience the fellowship of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings, we shall then be conformed to His death. As we are conformed to the death of Christ, we are ushered into the power of His resurrection. It is by this resurrection power that we know Christ and experience Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Philippians &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
