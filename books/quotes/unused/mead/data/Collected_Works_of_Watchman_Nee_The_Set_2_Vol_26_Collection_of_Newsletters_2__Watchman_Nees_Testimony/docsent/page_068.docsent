   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These three testimonies were given by Brother Watchman Nee in a co-workers' meeting held at Kulangsu, an island off the southeastern coast of Fukien province, China, in October 1936.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As far as I know, this was the only occasion in his life on which he spoke about his personal affairs in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Very seldom had he publicly related his own spiritual experience, probably "lest anyone account of me something above what he sees me to be or hears from me" 2 Cor 12:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The testimony which Paul gave in chapter twelve of 2 Corinthians was not publicly divulged until fourteen years later.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have often in the past been thinking of publishing these three testimonies, but in order to share his outlook, I have postponed until now after the lapse of thirty-seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When he died in mainland China on May 30, 1972, I decided to make these testimonies public.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe this is the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I hope that the readers will not pay attention to the person himself, but will pay attention to the work of the Lord in him, and to his willingness in allowing the Lord to perform His work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this way, the glory of the Lord will be expressed through him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As Paul said, "So that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ" 2 Thes 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first testimony: Salvation and calling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second testimony: 1 Learning the lesson of the cross, 2 Leading in the work, 3 God as my healer, and 4 Four aspects of work entrusted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The third testimony: 1 How to live a life of faith, 2 Attitude towards money, and 3 Looking to God for fulfilling the need of literary work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These three testimonies by no means comprise the whole of his spiritual life and work before 1936.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we read The Present Testimony, The Christian magazine, and open letters published by him before 1936, we can see that there were still a lot of testimonies and work done which were worth mentioning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In that co-workers' meeting, he could not speak more because of the limit of time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For several years Watchman Nee and I were classmates at Trinity College, a school founded by the Church of England in the city of Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were good friends and frequently studied and played together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During our junior and senior high school years, we were both nominal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We both had some knowledge of the Bible, and we outwardly kept the Christian forms of baptism, holy communion, church attendance, Bible study, and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we had never accepted in our hearts the Christ who was crucified for our sins and who resurrected on the third day, and we did not know Him as our personal Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We both loved the world and pursued the vanities of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Watchman Nee was pursuing scholastic attainment in the field of Chinese literature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He would frequently write articles for publication in the newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The money he earned was spent on lottery tickets.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was also fond of the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I preferred sports and yearned for the fame and praise of men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In our first college year, his life suddenly changed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He became a fervent Christian and ceased pursuing the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He frequently testified to his classmates, exhorting them to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many schoolmates did believe in the Lord and began voluntarily to pray in the college chapel, even during weekdays.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He would frequently study the Bible in class; however, this did not seem to affect his grades.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He usually came out with the highest examination scores in every subject.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The lives of many of the students were changed by accepting the Lord, and the dormitory director admitted that some mischievous students, who had previously violated school regulations, had accepted the Lord and experienced a great change in their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, he found himself with fewer cases of violation of school rules by students.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Watchman Nee invited me to attend some gospel meetings, but I refused.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>My heart was set on becoming famous in the sports world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day, however, he came to my room and preached the gospel to me alone, urging me to accept the Lord Jesus as my Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Though I attempted to argue with him concerning some religious problems, he would not argue; instead, he asked me several questions: "Have you sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you know if your sins are forgiven?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you know if you are saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the time I didn't understand why, but in my heart I felt sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later I realized that this was the convicting work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He preached the gospel to me, explaining that God loved me and gave His only begotten Son for me, and that if I would truly believe in Him, I would not perish but would have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When asked if I would believe in Christ, I said I would.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We knelt together and prayed, with him praying first.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then I prayed, asking the Lord to forgive my sins and thanking Him for loving and saving me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I rose up, my heart was filled with joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I experienced a great change in my life and brought forth the fruit of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>My name had been one of the names on his prayer list, and the Lord answered his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 1924 I transferred to Nanking University and came under the influence of modernism.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>My faith was shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At that time Watchman Nee was staying in a brother's home in Nanking, recuperating from an illness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I frequently visited him for fellowship, and he helped me escape the influence of modernism.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After his health improved, I was able to make arrangements for him to preach the gospel at Nanking University.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As a result of his preaching, two of my classmates were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 1928, when I was about to leave the university, I considered serving the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I did not want to be a preacher on salary, but I did not know how to live by faith, so I went to Watchman Nee for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At that time he was quite lonely and greatly in need of co-workers who would be of the same mind.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When I raised this matter, he did not encourage me in a careless manner to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He was neither influenced by his need for co-workers nor by the personal relationship between us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He simply told me not to wait until the Jordan waters opened, but to step into the water by faith then the way would open before me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He knew that I lacked this kind of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I was waiting for the outward circumstances to change before beginning to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Fifty years ago in China it was difficult to find anyone serving the Lord by faith like Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, I laid aside the thought of serving the Lord full-time and taught college for eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the spring of 1934, Watchman Nee held his third overcomer conference in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the morning he spoke on the centrality and universality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the afternoon he spoke on God's overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Through his messages in this conference, the Lord gave me revelation which brought about a great turn in my spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As a result, I stood up in the conference and for the first time consecrated my entire life to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At that time I was still teaching school.</S>
