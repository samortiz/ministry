<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD DWELLING IN US</h2><p>In order to understand the Man-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection as His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit, we need to read John 14:10-20 carefully again and again. In John 14 we see that when the Son came, the Father was in Him. Furthermore, when the Spirit comes, the Son is with Him. Hence, the Spirit comes as the consummation of the Triune God. This means that the Spirit comes as the Triune God. When the Spirit comes, the Triune God comes.</p><p>In the Bible the Hebrew word for Spirit is <i>ruach;</i> the Greek word is <i>pneuma.</i> Both words denote spirit, breath, air. We may say that our processed Triune God is like the air&mdash;so available for us to breathe in. Now we can understand why Romans 10:8 says that the word is not far from us but is very near, even in our mouth and in our heart. When we recognize this and respond by calling on the Lord Jesus, the Lord Jesus comes into us.</p><p>When the Lord is in us, the Spirit, the Son, and the Father are all in us. The spiritual air we breathe is actually the Triune God. Sometimes when I consider this, I am beside myself with joy in the Lord.</p><p>Do you know where the Triune God is? The Triune God is now in us! This is according to the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 14. He said that He would ask the Father to give us another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, who would be in us. But eventually the Lord went on to say that He Himself would be in us (v. 20). From the revelation in John 14 we see that the Triune God now dwells in us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD<br />DISPENSED INTO THE TRIPARTITE MAN</h2><p>In our study of the Bible we need to pay close attention to portions such as John 14:10-20. We should pay much more attention to verses such as these than to verses that speak about husbands loving their wives and wives submitting to their husbands. What we have in John 14:10-20 is far beyond our natural thought, which is easily occupied with teachings concerning love, submission, and humility. In chapter fourteen of John, however, the Lord Jesus says nothing about being humble, or about wives submitting to husbands and husbands loving their wives. Here He speaks concerning Himself, the Father, and the Comforter. Therefore, we need to pay close attention to this revelation.</p><p>Before I was saved, I studied the writings of Confucius. Confucius had much to say about a wife&rsquo;s submission to her husband. In fact, whereas the Bible teaches a wife to have a onefold submission, Confucius teaches a threefold submission. When I read the Bible after I was first saved, I was still under the influence of such teachings. But eventually I learned to pay attention to what the Bible reveals concerning the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man. This is the main subject of all my ministry. This is the focal point of all my messages in conferences and trainings. I encourage all the saints to pay their attention to the crucial matter of the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man and to speak of this to others.</p><p>Do you know what is revealed in John 14:10-20? Here we have a revelation of the Triune God dispensed into the tripartite man. Concerning this, John 14:20 says, &ldquo;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; In this verse the &ldquo;you&rdquo; is the tripartite man, and the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the Triune God. Therefore, &ldquo;I in you&rdquo; indicates that the Triune God is in the tripartite man. Of course, in order to see this in full, we would need a thorough study of the New Testament.</p><p>In order for the Triune God to be in the tripartite man, it was necessary for Him to pass through certain processes: incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. Having passed through all these processes, the Triune God is now not only on the throne but also in us. How wonderful! The Man-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit, and as this Spirit He now dwells in us.</p>
