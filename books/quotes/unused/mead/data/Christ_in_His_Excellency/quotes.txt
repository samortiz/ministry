[1]  CONTENTS The Surpassingness of Christ The Transcendence of Christ The Glory of Christ The Riches of Christ The Fullness of Christ
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE SURPASSINGNESS OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Matt 16:16; Acts 10:36; Eph 1:21-23; Col 1:18; Phil 2:9; Rev 19:16; 22:13; John 8:12; 11:25; 10:9; 14:6; 4:42 CHRIST IN HIS EXCELLENCY
[3]  The topic we will consider in this book is Christ in His excellency, or Christ in His supreme preciousness.
[4]  The expression Christ in His excellency or Christ in His supreme preciousness is not my invention.
[5]  I would like to testify to you that I was saved before reaching the age of twenty, and now I am nearly eighty; in these nearly sixty years, I have been reading the Bible almost every day and have worn out several Chinese Bibles.
[6]  C. Christ Being the Head of All, the One Who Fills All in All
[7]  Christ is our Lord, and even more He is the Lord of all.
[8]  Ephesians 1:21-23 says that He is "far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come" and that God "subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all."
[9]  H. Christ Being the First, the Last, the Beginning, and the End
[10]  Philippians 3:8 says, "On account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord."
[11]  CHRIST BEING FAR SUPERIOR TO ALL THINGS AND MATTERS
[12]  In China I once met some scholars who studied the works of Confucius and Mencius, and when I preached the gospel of the Lord Jesus to them, they all said very proudly, "You Christians who believe the Western religion preached by the Westerners are very shallow.
[13]  Their morality was quite high, but they did not have Christ within them.
[14]  However, if Christ is in me, when I love, it is not I who love, but Christ who loves.
[15]  Then he turned from the law and the religion of his ancestors to Christ and aspired to have his entire being saturated with Christ and filled with Christ that Christ might overflow from him so that all who observed him might find him to be one who was fully in Christ.
[16]  Paul knew Christ, appreciated Christ, and realized that Christ was exceedingly precious; so he diligently pursued the experience of Christ.
[17]  CHAPTER THREE THE GLORY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Heb 1:3; John 17:5; 1:4, 21-24; Phil 2:15-16; 1:20-21; Col 1:27 GLORY BEING THE EXPRESSION OF GOD
[18]  We have seen the surpassingness and transcendence of Christ, and now we come to see the glory of Christ.
[19]  Christ being the effulgence of God's glory means that we cannot see God Himself, just as we cannot see the sun itself, but we can see the effulgence of God's glory, which is Jesus Christ.
[20]  CHRIST HAVING THE GLORY ALONG WITH THE FATHER IN ETERNITY
[21]  John 17:5 says, "And now, glorify Me along with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was."
[22]  This tells us that in eternity past the Lord Jesus had the same glory as God.
[23]  The Father being glorified in the glorification of His Son Jesus is a matter of life.
[24]  Two thousand years ago, among millions of people, only the Lord Jesus had the divine life and the divine nature within Him.
[25]  In other words, just as Christ has the life and nature of God for the expression of God, so also we, whom God has chosen and given to the Lord Jesus, have the life and nature of God for the expression of God.
[26]  CHAPTER FOUR THE RICHES OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 3:8; John 16:13-15; 1:14, 16; Phil 1:19 A CENTRAL SUBJECT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[27]  We have spoken about the surpassingness of Christ, the transcendence of Christ, and the glory of Christ.
[28]  Christ is the Lamb of God, the Sun of Righteousness, the tree of life, the fountain of life, the Priest, the Prophet, the King, the Savior, the Mediator, the Physician, the Shepherd, the Counselor, the Head, our Brother, our Father, our God, our Lord, our Teacher, our Beloved, our Friend, life, power, wisdom, righteousness, holiness, redemption, peace, joy, hope, comfort, glory, light, and way, for a total of thirty-three items.
[29]  Can we not simply say that the riches of Christ are all that is Christ's?
[30]  John 1:14 and 16 say, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us full of grace and reality .For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace."
[31]  When Christ came in time into the human race, He was God tabernacling and dwelling among men.
[32]  Now Christ has become the Spirit to dwell in us; therefore, we have received the grace of Christ.
[33]  Christ had to become the Spirit of reality for you to receive of His fullness and grace upon grace; the riches of Christ can now become your supply.
[34]  With the foregoing knowledge, we are clear that the riches of Christ are the Triune God Himself.
[35]  The Bible says clearly that God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[36]  THE ACCOMPLISHING OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST Incarnation Christ in the Flesh
[37]  Christ was originally the infinite God in eternity; in Him all the fullness of the Godhead was hidden Col 2:9 .
[38]  Although He is still Christ, the Christ after resurrection is different from the incarnated Christ who had not yet passed through death and resurrection.
[39]  Enjoying the Riches of Christ and Expressing the Virtues of God
[40]  The resurrected Christ, the "pneumatic Christ," is both God and man, possessing both divinity and humanity.
[41]  After the Lord Jesus resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit, the riches of Christ became in us the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[42]  In the last chapter we covered the riches of Christ.
[43]  We can say that the fullness of Christ is the most profound subject in the New Testament, and its profoundness lies in the fact that the riches of Christ become the fullness of Christ.
[44]  Many people cannot even clearly distinguish between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ.
[45]  THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST BEING THE OVERFLOW OF GRACE AND REALITY
[46]  Beginning from the time we are saved, we receive grace and reality from His fullness, and it is a receiving without end until we grow up to be a full-grown man with the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[47]  The church does not only have the riches of Christ, but it is also the fullness of Christ.
[48]  The church as the Body of Christ becomes the fullness of Christ for the expression of Christ.
[49]  If we want to become the fullness of Christ, we must enjoy the riches of Christ as food and be filled with these riches that the element of the divine life may become our riches.
[50]  Therefore, God wants us to enjoy the riches of Christ, to be constituted and saturated with the riches of Christ, and to become the Body of Christ for His expression in each locality that is on the ground of oneness.
[51]  The expression of Christ is the expression of God.
[52]  Because the fullness of Christ is the fullness of God, the expression of Christ is also the expression of God.
[53]  Ephesians 3:17-19 says, "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God."
[54]  When we experience Christ together with the brothers and sisters in the church and together apprehend the dimensions of Christ, we discover that the riches of Christ are limitless and immeasurable.
