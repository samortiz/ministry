   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST IN US Scripture Reading: Col 1:24-27; 2:2; Eph 3:4; John 20:22; 1 Cor 15:45 THE BIBLE CONTAINING A MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible, the greatest book on earth, is the most complete book, revealing many things concerning God, the universe, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A person today can learn more than the greatest philosophers of the past simply by reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, there is one thing in the Bible called a mystery, which is something that is hidden and difficult to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An example of a mystery is the physical human life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know that we have something called life, but no one has ever seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We recognize that a machine does not have life, and we know that death is the absence of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we still cannot exactly define life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A medical examination cannot locate life within a person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that life is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is unquestionably real, yet it is hidden, invisible, and beyond understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Just as there is a mystery in our physical body called life, there is also a mystery in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many great teachers have read and thought that they understood the Bible, yet they never saw the mystery in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>PAUL S STEWARDSHIP BEING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>TO COMPLETE THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Colossians 1:24-25 says, The church; of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Minister means one who serves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Attendants on an airplane meet the needs of the passengers, serving them with food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul was a minister because he served the churches with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul s stewardship was to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before Paul s writing, much of the Bible already existed, but without Paul s writing, the word of God would not be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul s fourteen Epistles are the completion of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many Bible translations, including the King James Version, do not adequately translate to complete the word of God in verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul s books are as crucial to the Bible as our heart is to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A person s heart is not easy to see.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Bible readers do not know that the heart of the Bible is Paul s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE WORD OF GOD BEING THE MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verses 26 through 27 say, The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the Greek grammar, the word of God at the end of verse 25 is the mystery at the beginning of verse 26.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The completion of God s word in Paul s fourteen Epistles reveals the mystery, that which is hidden and beyond understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE MYSTERY BEING CHRIST IN US</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 27 goes on to reveal that the mystery is Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ in us is the mystery, the completion of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In today s age people reject superstition and demand scientific explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, Christ being in us is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not something that we can substantiate by our physical senses or mental comprehension, yet we believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not superstitious or scientific, but it is real.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For nearly two thousand years countless Christians have read the Bible but have not seen the mystery revealed in Colossians 1:26-27.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When most people read the Bible, they see only outward rules and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These things are easy to see, like a person s nose, ears, and arms.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, like a person s heart, the mystery in the Bible, which is Christ in us, is real and living but difficult to perceive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This mystery was hidden from the ages and from the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even the Old Testament patriarchs, kings, and prophets did not know the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, God raised up Paul and sent him to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ in us is the heart of the Bible, and it is also the heart of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before we believed in Christ, we were lifeless corpses.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we repented, believed in the Lord, and called upon His name, a heart was transplanted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That heart is Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I first came to the United States, I found that the Christians were not aware of two crucial things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First, very few knew that they had a human spirit, and hardly anyone talked about the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Second, I discovered that most Christians in the United States did not believe that Christ is in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I began to teach that Christ is in us, some began to publish books to oppose this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They said that I made Christ small by saying that He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They believed that because Christ is unlimited and great, man is too small to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Romans 8:34 says that Christ is at the right hand of God, but verse 10 of the same chapter says that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moreover, Ephesians 4:6 says that the Father is in all, which means that the Father is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>John 14:23 indicates that the Father and the Son make a mutual abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Finally, in John 15:4 the Lord said, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ abides in us, and we abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The meaning of abide implies that Christ is not only in us but also remains and makes His dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ being in us is the mystery and the completion of the word of God, the heart of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ is in every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Colossians 1:27 says that Christ in us is the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can express Christ because He is in us.</S>
