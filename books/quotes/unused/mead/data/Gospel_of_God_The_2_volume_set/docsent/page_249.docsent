   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE GEHENNA OF FIRE IN THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are many places in the Bible that mention God's punishment for the defeated Christians in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We will take a look at these places now.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, we will draw a conclusion concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE ENTRANCE INTO AND</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE POSITION IN THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us first consider Matthew 18:1-3.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst and said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here the disciples asked a question concerning the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a question concerning greatness in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not a question concerning salvation and perdition, but a question concerning being great or small, high or low, in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus showed us that unless we turn and become like little children, we cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Following this, verse 4 says, "He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 3 gives us the condition for entering the kingdom, while verse 4 gives us the way to be great in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 3 says that we must turn and become like children before we can enter the kingdom, and verse 4 says that if we continue to be children and humble ourselves, we will be the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows us that in the kingdom we should continue in the same way that we begin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The direction we face when we enter the kingdom should be the same direction we face when we continue in it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we must turn and become like little children; and to be great in the kingdom of the heavens, we must continue to be humble like children.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here the Lord continues to bring up the matter of being like children.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Following this, the Lord said, "And whoever receives one such little child because of My name, receives Me" v. 5 . Whoever receives someone like this child because of Christ's name, that is, someone who turns to become like a child and who continues to be humble like a child, receives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe in Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea" v. 6 . This word indicates that stumbling others is a bigger problem than suffering and being killed in an ignoble way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose someone kills you and casts your body into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are not even buried properly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Indeed this would be an unfortunate tragedy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if you stumble others, your fate will be worse than this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 7 says, "Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes."</S>
