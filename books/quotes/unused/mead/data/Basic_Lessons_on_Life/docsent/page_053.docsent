   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Law of Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Natural Ability and Function of Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The law of life is the natural ability and function of life Rom 8:2; Heb 8:10 and is another item of the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because this life-law functions within us, it surely gives us a certain kind of sensation, so it is an aspect of the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 8:2 speaks of the law of the Spirit of life, and Hebrews 8:10 says that this law is inscribed on our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>C. The Holy Spirit the Anointing Ointment</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit the anointing ointment is also an aspect of the source of the sense of life Rom 8:11; 1 John 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Exodus 30 speaks of the anointing ointment, the compound ointment for the tabernacle and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In ancient times, the tabernacle with all its utensils and the priests were anointed with the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today the Holy Spirit is the ointment to the whole church with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit anoints us continuously, and His anointing is a kind of inner working and moving which gives us the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This anointing Spirit is also the source of the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>D. Christ Abiding in Us</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ abiding in us is another aspect of the source of the sense of life John 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, His abiding in us is the function of life and gives us the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>E. God Operating in Us</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is operating in us all the time Phil 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His inner operation gives us the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, it is a source of the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regardless of how moral the unbelievers are, they have only the human conscience to go by, and this has been greatly damaged by the fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even today with many unbelievers, their conscience has been damaged and even seared by their daily sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their damaged conscience does not work very well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even if the unbelievers' conscience did work well, it is the only thing that they have.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The teaching of Confucius is altogether centered on the developing of the conscience, which is referred to by him as the "bright virtue."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His ethical teachings and the positive teachings of the good philosophers are focused on the development of the human conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The development of the goodness within a person is the development of his conscience, which was created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The unbelievers have the human conscience, but we believers have not only a created conscience but also a renewed conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our conscience, as a part of our spirit Rom 9:1; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>8:16 , has been renewed through the regeneration of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition to this renewed conscience we have these five great things: the divine life, the law of the divine life, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, there is no comparison between the created conscience of the unbelievers and the renewed conscience of the believers who are indwelt by the Triune God as the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We Christians should be persons full of feeling all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not be dull or numb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be very sensitive, full of sensations because we are living and rich in life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is because we have a regenerated spirit with our conscience renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We also have the divine life, the law of this divine life, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore the sense of life is high, rich, strong, and keen within us.</S>
