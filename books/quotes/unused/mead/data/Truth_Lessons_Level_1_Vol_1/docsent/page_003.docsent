   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we are saved, in order to have spiritual growth, we must know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For two thousand years Christians have acknowledged one thing, that no one can know the Lord well without knowing the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spiritual inheritance which God has given to us includes, on the one hand, the invisible Holy Spirit and, on the other hand, the visible Holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, the Spirit is within us; on the other hand, the Scripture is outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A proper Christian must be balanced in these two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we only have the Holy Spirit within but do not have the Scripture without, we will make mistakes easily.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we only have the Scripture without, but do not have the Holy Spirit within, we will become dead, without vitality or livingness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A Christian is like a train which needs motivating power within and tracks without.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Having these two aspects the inward and the outward coordinating together, the train can move, even move very well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is exactly true of the Holy Spirit within us and the Holy Scriptures outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you are filled with the Holy Spirit within and you also know the Bible without, then, as a Christian, you are living and stable, and you are also active and accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You are a Christian who is living and stable as well as active and accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I. THE ORIGIN OF THE BIBLE A. The Bible Being God-breathed</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Scripture is God-breathed 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This tells us that the Scripture did not come out of man s thought, man s mind, but rather, it is God s breathing His thought and His word through His Spirit into and out of the writers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the Bible contains God s elements and carries His flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As Christians, our greatest joy, or shall we say, our greatest blessing, is to be able to contact God and taste Him daily through the word of His breath.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. The Bible Being the Speaking from God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>by Men Borne by the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since the Scripture is God s breathing His word out from men through His Spirit, no word of the Scripture can be of man s will; rather, men were borne by the Spirit and spoke out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word, men spoke from God, being borne by the Holy Spirit 2 Pet 1:21 , has a twofold meaning: first, men were borne by the Spirit; second, men spoke from God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the original Greek, being borne by the Holy Spirit means being carried along as a ship by the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The writers of the Bible received God s inspiration, and they were under the power of the Holy Spirit, being borne and carried along by Him to speak out God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, when they spoke, they spoke from within God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was the Spirit of God carrying men along to speak, and it was also men speaking from within God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, it was God speaking His own word from within men through their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second Samuel 23:2 says, The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This word was spoken by David.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He told us that the words he spoke were the speaking of the Spirit of God through him, and that it was God s word that was in his tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not only the Holy Spirit spoke through him, but also God s word was in his tongue and was spoken from his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>C. The Bible Being God s Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>in the Prophets and in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Old Testament is God s speaking in the prophets; the New Testament is God s speaking in the Son, our Lord Jesus Heb 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, whether it is the speaking of the prophets in the Old Testament or the speaking of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament, both are God s speaking and both are of God.</S>
