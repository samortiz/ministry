According to the Bible and even according to scientific study, it is clear that man is the center of the universe
He began with the creation of the things of the lowest form of life, the life that is without consciousness, which is the plant life
Without the human life, there would be no one to enjoy the beauty of the plant life and the stimulation of the animal life
The heavens and the earth, with the plant life and the animal life, become meaningless without man as the center
In this conference of the Godhead, a decision was made to create man in His image and according to His likeness
Genesis 1 says that God made the decision to have man in His own image and to have man entrusted with His authority
Note that the psalmist did not say that Jehovah's name is excellent 'in all the heavens,' but 'in all the earth'
To be saved is to have God identified with you, to have God incarnated in you, to have God become one with you
Without the Christians, without those of us who realize that we are VIPs, what would the situation of the world be today?
The age has been turned from religion to Christ, from doctrines to the Spirit, from the forms and rituals to the new and living way
When Stephen was being stoned to death in his martyrdom, he saw 'the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God'
After Christ was resurrected from the dead and ascended to the heavens, He came down as the life-giving Spirit and as the Spirit of power
The gospel preached at the beginning of the New Testament was: 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
In a general sense, the religious people are not only better than the materialistic people but also better than the moral people
For us to be perfect as the Father is perfect simply means that we have the Father's image, or in other words, that we express the Father
As long as you are under God's dominion, God's authority, all things will be under your dominion, your authority
Brothers and sisters, the Lord is going to gain a people of the young generation who truly seek first God's kingdom and God's righteousness
Matthew 5:10 says, 'Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
If you are seeking to be right with the Lord, to be right according to God, be prepared to be opposed and persecuted
Today what the Lord is doing is to gain such a people as a preparation for His coming back to take over the earth
In the same manner, we are incapable in the spiritual realm, but we can breathe in Christ , drink Christ , and take Christ in as our food
For the past years we have been stressing Christ as our life, but in recent days the Lord has shown us that He is also a person
When we are willing to forget about ourselves and take Christ as our person, we will be rooted and grounded in love
Before we continue with the matter of Christ as the meaning of human life let us review some of the points covered in the preceding chapters
In the Gospel of Matthew, which is the book of the kingdom, we have the term kingdom the kingdom of the heavens
In the book of Matthew we also have the phrase the righteousness of God, which equals the image of God in Genesis 1
To have the righteousness of God does not mean merely to be right with God but to be right according to what God is
The religious people stress the matter of being right with God but often neglect the matter of being right according to what God is
He also saw the vision of the transfigured, glorified Jesus and even had the experience of the outpoured Spirit on the day of Pentecost
These animals or beasts were considered common and unclean by the Jews according to the Old Testament ordinances
Rather, he behaved rightly according to the religious concept that was passed down from his forefathers for many generations
It is not so easy for you to realize that you can be deceived by religious things and even by spiritual things
Satan utilizes all things whether material things moral things religious things or spiritual things to keep you away from Gods dominion
Today the enemy not only uses material things but also utilizes religion and so-called spirituality to deceive you
He causes you to care only for being religious, for being godly, and for being spiritual, yet not to care for God's authority
When Peter went back to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision disputed with him, questioning him about his eating with the uncircumcised
With the six brothers as witnesses to his word, Peter narrated the whole story to the brothers in Jerusalem and was vindicated of his way
We have to be right day and night according to what God is and according to what God says, not according to our religious concept or opinion
In Matthew, in the so-called Sermon on the Mount, the Lord Jesus said, 'You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect'
That we should be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect means that we should be the expression of the Father
You became fallen from the dominion and the image of God, so now you need to return to the dominion and the expression of God
The gospel of God is not a matter of repenting that we may go to heaven or that we may be forgiven of our sins
There was another one, an old brother in Jerusalem named Simeon, who 'was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel'
The old holy people, holding the holy Scriptures, were worshipping and serving in the holy temple, in the holy city, and in the holy land
You may say these young people are hippies and are not holy, but the Lord says, 'They are coming along with Me
If the young people of this generation were still stuck to the old way of living, it would be rather hard for them to be saved
If two or three hundred of the young saints have the feeling and the burden to go to the beach to meet, they should do it
Apparently, Anna and Simeon were not in that move, but they were absolutely for that move and they prayed very much for it
He used those who were not in the temple, but in the boats on the sea, and He used those who were willing to jump into the water
The Lord Jesus exercised much training with Peter to bring him out of the religious and materialistic concept and into the dominion of God
John 1:4a says, 'In Him was life,' and 10:10b says, 'I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly'
All the animal lives, such as the dog life, the cat life, or the bird life, are not good for receiving another life
When we read Matthew 5 7, we may want to give up, because what the Lord says here is impossible for us to carry out by our human life
He is not the doctrinal Christ nor the Christ in teachings, but the Christ who is so present, real, and practical as the life-giving Spirit
In conclusion, we need to keep in mind that for us to express God and to exercise His authority, we need Christ as life
Man, the corporate man, as the center of the universe is for the church because eventually the church comes into being out of man
The resurrection of Christ, the ascension of Christ, the enthronement of Christ, and the glorification of Christ, all are for the church
Ephesians 4 says that when Christ ascended to the height, He led a train of vanquished foes and gave gifts to men
The new man, the church, the Body of Christ, was created with all kinds of people, who have their particular ways of living
If those dissenting ones who walked out insist on not having a certain way of meeting, that means they have a strong ordinance
If the ones who stayed insist on having their way of meeting, they also become a people with a strong ordinance
He would also travel around to find a meeting where everybody is so free to dress the way he wants and shout and be excited
If the first one does not like the second one, he cannot blame the second one but can only go to blame his parents
If you decide to drop the church because you dislike the noisy ones, this means you are keeping your choice and giving up your destiny
In our natural makeup, in our natural life, there is a kind of desire to have a community where we may live together with others
We all have to realize that the desire to have a communal life was something created in the human nature by God
Since God created in you a desire to drink so that you have such a thirst, you will be happy to drink without anyone forcing you
Due to the fall, however, this communal life was spoiled and damaged when the human race came to the time of Babel
If you put a large number of people together for even a short period of time, there will be arguing and fighting
When we Christians come together and realize that we have Christ within us, immediately we have a wonderful love for one another
Satan not only damaged the old man in God's old creation; he also tried and is still trying to damage the new man in Christ
We need to tell the unbelievers that the way to have the proper communal life is to receive Christ and get into the church
If four brothers come together to live in the same house as roommates, they all need to take Christ as their person
Young brothers and sisters, if you have the intention to go and disciple the unbelievers, you have to be on high
Jesus has the authority, not the government of the United States, nor the government of Russia, nor the government of China
Matthew 28:19 also shows us that when we go to disciple others, we need to have the realization that we are in the Triune God
You need to have the realization and the assurance that you are putting people into God, because you are in God
When the power from on high comes upon us, we will be qualified and equipped for witnessing unto the uttermost part of the earth
Many Christians try their best to preach the gospel, yet their preaching is powerless because they are not built together with others
Can you tell the enemy from your pure conscience that you are really built up together as one in Christ and with Christ?
It was not that Paul and Barnabas were praying in their home and in their morning watch they received guidance and inspiration from the Lord
Verse 3 says that three of them sent out Barnabas and Saul, but verse 4 says that Barnabas and Saul were sent out by the Holy Spirit
They went out from the church, the work they did was for the church, and eventually they came back to the church in Antioch
Acts 131 says the prophets and teachers were in Antioch in the local church and 1423 speaks of every church that is every local church
There may be much discussion about the church, the Body life, the Body ministry, the New Testament church, but where is it?
We need to pray, 'O Lord, help us to have the proper church life and to be so definite and practical in the church life'
Even a little nose which is useful for breathing becomes useless and frightening if it is separated from the body
Many dear Christians today could be really useful members, but they have become 'terrifying' because they are isolated from the Body
Many dear Christians consider themselves so wonderful and marvelous, yet they do not realize that they are terrifying due to their isolation
