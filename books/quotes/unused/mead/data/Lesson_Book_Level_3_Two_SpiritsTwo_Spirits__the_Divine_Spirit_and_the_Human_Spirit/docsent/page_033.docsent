   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Beholding and Reflecting the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 3:18 tells us how we can be transformed: "And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we behold and reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord, we are transformed into the Lord's image from one stage of glory to another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When a mirror beholds anything, it reflects what it beholds.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if a mirror is veiled, its face is not open; even if it beholds an object, it cannot reflect it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are an open mirror, we will reflect Christ by beholding Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord is the Spirit transforming us within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although we are so natural and even sinful, the Spirit transforms our natural image into His glorious image.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are still veiled in some way, we shall be like a camera with the lens covered.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No light will be able to penetrate our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we want to be unveiled, we need to say to the Lord, "Lord, take away anything that is covering me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, remove my veils.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Take away any opinions that are veils to me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, I want to be completely open, absolutely unveiled."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then with an unveiled face we shall behold and reflect the glory of the Lord and be transformed into His image from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today the glory is the resurrected Christ, and this Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the Lord as the glory is the Spirit living in us and dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now that we have the Spirit indwelling our spirit, we need to exercise our spirit more and more by praying, reading the Word, and calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we exercise our spirit with an unveiled face, the more we shall behold the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we are gazing on Him, we shall also reflect Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While we are beholding and reflecting Him in this way, His element, His essence, will be added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This new element will replace and discharge the element of our old, natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we shall experience transformation, a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We shall be transformed into the Lord's image.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Transformation is the change or reaction in our being that results from the divine life being imparted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not just an outward change but a change in life, a metabolic change in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we open to the Lord, Christ as the Spirit imparts Himself into us as the transforming element.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not be conformed to this modern age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By beholding and reflecting the Lord with an unveiled face, we will be transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>QUESTIONS How does transformation relate to sanctification?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Briefly describe how a chemical reaction can illustrate the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the difference between a metabolic change and a mere outward change in appearance?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Relate this to our transformation.</S>
