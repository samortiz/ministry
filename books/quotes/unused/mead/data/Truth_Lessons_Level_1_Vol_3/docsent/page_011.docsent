   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A HOLY CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s calling is a holy calling 2 Tim 1:9a .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has called the believers that He may separate them from all the common things and sanctify them unto Himself for His own purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, God s calling is a holy calling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A HEAVENLY CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s calling is a heavenly calling Heb 3:1 , the high calling Phil 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek word for high literally means above.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the high calling is the calling from above, from the heavens, by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is equivalent to the heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s calling to the children of Israel was a low calling, an earthly calling, to receive the earthly blessing for the possession of the physical land.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s calling to the believers, however, is a high calling, a heavenly calling, to receive the heavenly blessing for the possession of the all-inclusive Christ and all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A. A Calling of the Divine Hope</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This heavenly calling is a calling of the divine hope Eph 1:18a; 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As God s called people, we are full of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Colossians 1:27 says that Christ in us is the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, our hope is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are called with a calling of the divine hope to possess, partake of, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today He is our life and hope Col 3:4; 1:27; Eph 4:4 ; in the future He will be our glory and inheritance 1 Pet 5:1; 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this age we live by, experience, and enjoy the life of Christ, and we also pursue diligently the growth and development of life unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Christ our hope comes again, He will redeem our fallen and corrupted body Rom 8:23 by transfiguring it and making it the same as the body of His glory Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He will conform us to His glorious image Rom 8:29 , making us holy and absolutely like Him in our regenerated spirit, transformed soul, and transfigured body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will glorify us Rom 8:30 , immersing us in His glory Heb 2:10 that we may enter into His heavenly kingdom 2 Tim 4:18; 2 Pet 1:11 , the kingdom into which He has called us 1 Thes 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He will enable us to inherit the inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for us 1 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He even will cause us to reign together with Him as kings and to share His joy Matt 25:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the calling of the divine hope which we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>B. A Walk Worthy of the Calling</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We were called with the heavenly calling to walk worthily in the church Eph 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our walk in the church should be worthy of the calling with which we were called.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, we need to be transformed that we may have a proper, normal humanity, living a life of lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love, and being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace Eph 4:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, we need to have seven things as the base of our oneness: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God Eph 4:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, we can live a life that is worthy of the calling with which we were called.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The heavenly calling also supplies us with the reality of the Triune God, which is the unsearchable riches of Christ Eph 3:8b and His immeasurable dimensions Eph 3:18 , that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God Eph 3:19b for God s expression Eph 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us, such as light, life, righteousness, and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These riches are unsearchable and untraceable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The immeasurable dimensions of Christ are the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe Eph 3:18 , that we may experience Christ in His breadth, length, height, and depth, without limit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To walk in the church worthily of God s calling, we need to enjoy continually what Christ is and has, allowing Him to impart God s riches into us, that we may be filled even unto the fullness of God for the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the proper condition of the church; this is also the proper living of the called ones.</S>
