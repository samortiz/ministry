[1]  CONTENT The Significance of God's Calling The Background and Origin of God's Calling
[2]  and the Experience of the Called The Motive and Strength of Being Called The Progress in Answering God's Calling Living by Faith The Trial of the Called The Victory of the Called Knowing Grace for the Fulfillment of God's Purpose
[3]  Abraham Called by God is composed of messages taken from Life-study of Genesis, a detailed study of the book of Genesis that emphasizes the experience of Christ as life for the fulfillment of the eternal purpose of God to have a corporate expression of Himself.
[4]  1 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GOD'S CALLING Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee: and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
[5]  Genesis 12:1-3 The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles out of faith, announced the gospel beforehand to Abraham: "In you shall all the nations be blessed."
[6]  THE LORD'S JEHOVAH'S CALLING, FULFILLING GOD'S PURPOSE BY GOD'S PROCEDURE Although Satan, working through fallen man, had apparently driven God out from the earth, God is sovereign and cannot be defeated or frustrated by any kind of attack.
[7]  All of Satan's work simply affords Him an excellent opportunity to display His wisdom.
[8]  Although sometimes I was sorry that I was a fallen person, most of the time I rejoiced, because I had been redeemed, regenerated, and regained.
[9]  THE NEW BEGINNING OF GOD Now we need to consider the significance, the meaning, of God's calling.
[10]  The picture that is portrayed in Abraham is very clear.
[11]  He had the new beginning, the transfer of race, and the transfer of life, which was a great problem to both him and God.
[12]  FIRSTLY RELYING UPON ELIEZER When God called Abraham out of the corrupted land, Abraham had no sons, no successors.
[13]  Because Abraham was childless, he relied upon Eliezer, his household servant, to be the possessor of his house, saying to the Lord, "Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the son of possession of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
[14]  Later, when God told Abraham that Eliezer would not be his heir and that only the one born of himself would be his heir, God strongly confirmed His promise that Abraham would have seed of himself 15:2-5 .
[15]  BRINGING FORTH ISAAC BY THE STRENGTH OF GOD'S GRACE At the time when God changed Abraham's name and commanded him to be circumcised, God said to him in 17:21, Isaac, which Sarah shall bare unto thee at this set time in the next year."
[16]  In a sense, in Isaac the transfer of life was accomplished but it was not fully completed.
[17]  We know this by the fact that Isaac still begat Esau whom God hated Rom 9:13 .
[18]  2 THE BACKGROUND AND ORIGIN OF GOD'S CALLING AND THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CALLED And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt across the River long ago, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor; and they served other gods.
[19]  FORSAKING GOD Now in this message we need to see the experience of the called ones.
[20]  But before we come to this, we need to consider the background and origin of God's calling.
[21]  When God appeared to Abraham, he was in the darkest background.
[22]  According to Acts 7, God called Abraham out of his country and out of his kindred.
[23]  The God of Abraham the Father God's calling to Abraham was the work of God the Father.
[24]  Abraham's original name was Abram which means "an exalted father," and the name Abraham, that replaced this name, means "the father of a great multitude."
[25]  Abraham's Experience Abraham had a good beginning with being called, but there is no record of his being chosen or of his reaching an ultimate and matured end. For his completion, Abraham had the need of Jacob's being chosen and of Jacob's matured end. Do you believe that, according to the record of Genesis, Abraham attained to the highest and consummate maturity of life? We cannot find such a record.
[26]  Isaac's experience was without beginning or end. He was never called and he never matured.
[27]  Although he blessed his sons, he did it blindly 27:18-29 , not so clearly as Jacob did with his grandsons.
[28]  When God appeared to him in a dream at Bethel, Jacob said upon waking, "If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on then shall the Lord be my God and of all that thou shall give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee" 28:20-22 .
[29]  Genesis 12:1 And he said, Men, brothers and fathers, listen.
[30]  The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, and said to him, "Come out from your land and from your relatives, and come into the land which I will show you."
[31]  In the last message we saw that the Triune God dealt with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as one complete corporate man.
[32]  Outside of Stephen's word in Acts 7:2, where Stephen told his persecutors that the God of glory appeared to their father Abraham, there is no other verse in the Bible that says that the God of glory appeared to Abraham.
[33]  The second factor of the motive and strength was God's calling Acts 7:3-4; Gen 12:1 .
[34]  When God came to Abraham, telling him to get out of his country, Abraham might have said within himself, "What about the matter of being a nation?"
[35]  GOD'S PROMISE BEING THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO ABRAHAM When I read 12:2-3 as a young man, I was not inspired by it.
[36]  I did not understand what God was talking about when He told Abraham that He would make of him a great nation, and that He would bless him, and make him a blessing.
[37]  The three items of God's promise to make of Abraham a great nation, to bless him, and to make him a blessing to all the families of the earth were the gospel preached to Abraham Gal 3:8 .
[38]  In God's promise to Abraham As we have seen, in God's promise to Abraham, the nation, which is for dominion to represent God, is mentioned first and the blessing, which is for the image to express God, is mentioned second.
[39]  4 THE PROGRESS IN ANSWERING GOD'S CALLING And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
[40]  And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
[41]  Why did God need to appear to Abraham twice and call him twice?
[42]  CALLED THE SECOND TIME AT HARAN AFTER HIS FATHER'S DEATH
[43]  But Abraham was not that high; he was as low as we are.
[44]  When God came to Abraham, he lacked the boldness to take action.
[45]  Regardless of how long Abraham delayed in answering God's calling, he could not delay God very long.
[46]  5 LIVING BY FAITH By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.
[47]  Hebrews 11:8 For we walk by faith, not by appearance.
[48]  2 Corinthians 5:7 And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.
[49]  And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.
[50]  If you say that you have been called, I would ask you this question: What is the seal of your calling?
[51]  The reappearing of God to Abraham was the strength that enabled him to live by faith.
[52]  THE SECOND ALTAR After Abraham built an altar to the Lord at Moreh, he traveled through the land.
[53]  God did not give him just one little spot; He gave him a spacious land.
[54]  In his travels, Abraham came to a place that was between Bethel and Ai.
[55]  AT THE PLACE OF FELLOWSHIP Later, Abraham removed his tent to Hebron, which means fellowship 13:18 .
[56]  His tent firstly was a testimony for God to the world and then it became the center where he had fellowship with God.
[57]  This is strongly proved by what occurred in chapter eighteen when God came to stay with him in the tent at Mamre in Hebron.
[58]  By Abraham's pitching a tent God had a place on earth where He could communicate and fellowship with man.
[59]  LIVING IN A SHADOW OF THE NEW JERUSALEM Abraham's tent was a miniature of the New Jerusalem, which will be the ultimate tabernacle of God in the universe Rev 21:2-3 .
[60]  As he lived in that tent, he was living in a shadow of the New Jerusalem.
[61]  While he was living there with God, he was waiting for a city, a city that eventually will be the New Jerusalem.
[62]  We all need to be those who live in a tent and who look forward to a better country, a country in which there will be the eternal tabernacle where God and we, we and God, will live together for eternity.
[63]  Although God had told him that He would give the land to Abraham and his descendants, Abraham did not care for that.
[64]  6 THE TRIAL OF THE CALLED And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
[65]  And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
[66]  As we have seen, the second aspect of Abraham's experience was living by faith.
[67]  He had to live by trusting in God for his daily needs.
[68]  This famine was a test to see whether or not Abraham would trust in God in the matter of making a living, in the matter of his daily living.
[69]  Verse 17 says, "And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife."
[70]  After passing through the experience in chapter twelve, it might be easy for Abraham or for us to say, "Praise the Lord, I have learned the lesson!"
[71]  But some tests are needed to prove whether or not we have truly learned the lesson.
[72]  7 THE VICTORY OF THE CALLED And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
[73]  And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: and blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.
[74]  Genesis 14:18-20 So also Christ did not glorify Himself in becoming a High Priest, but it was He who said to Him, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You"; even as also in another place He says, "You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec."
[75]  Hebrews 5:5-6 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace; being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.
[76]  Genesis 14:13 says, "And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew."
[77]  The four kings had captured Sodom and all of its food supply, but one person who escaped told Abraham that Lot had been captured.
[78]  How was it possible for one who escaped to have come to Abraham, and how could Abraham have made such a brief and bold decision?
[79]  When Melchisedec came to Abraham, he blessed Abraham with the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth v. 19 . This proves that he was greater than Abraham Heb 7:6-7 . He also blessed God for Abraham's victory v. 20 . Our victory always causes our Melchisedec to grant us blessing and to give blessing to God.
[80]  Abraham's victory regulated and restituted the whole situation and rearranged the entire environment.
[81]  8 KNOWING GRACE FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S PURPOSE THE SEED AND THE LAND After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
[82]  And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
[83]  God's saying this to Abraham indicates that Abraham was fearing his enemies.
[84]  God seemed to be telling him, "Abraham, you don't need to fear.
[85]  FOR HIM TO EXIST Prior to chapter fifteen, Abraham had experienced God as the One who protected him and provided many material things 12:16 .
[86]  Abraham had given all the choices to Lot and had gained the victory over the four kings.
[87]  At this point, I need to say a word about the difference between grace and blessing.
[88]  What most Christians consider to be grace is actually blessing.
[89]  THE LAND The second thing needed for the fulfillment of God's purpose was the land 15:17-21; see 12:7; 13:14-15, 17; 17:8 .
[90]  The definition of the land What is the land?
[91]  Furthermore, during Abraham's time, the land was a place in which Abraham could defeat all of his enemies in order that God might have a kingdom on earth.
[92]  Thus, we see five points concerning the land: that it was a place for God's people to live in, a place for them to live on, a place where God's enemies could be defeated, a place where God could have His kingdom, and a place where God could have a habitation for His expression.
[93]  9 KNOWING GRACE FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S PURPOSE GOD'S COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
[94]  And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
[95]  And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
[96]  If we read Genesis 15 through 22 carefully, we shall see that in these chapters God was dealing with Abraham in order to bring him to the realization that he needed His grace in order to fulfill His eternal purpose.
[97]  So God came in not simply to bless Abraham outwardly but to work Himself into him as grace in order that Abraham might have something substantial for the carrying out of God's eternal purpose.
[98]  The seed that God promised Abraham is today the corporate Christ, and the land that God promised him is the wonderful resurrected and elevated Christ in whom we rest and slaughter our enemies and in whom God establishes His kingdom and builds up His habitation that He might be expressed and represented.
[99]  When Abraham believed in God for the promise concerning the seed, his faith, which was so precious to God, was counted as righteousness to him by God.
[100]  After this, however, when God also promised Abraham that He would give him the land, Abraham fell short, saying to the Lord, "Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?" v. 8 . Although he was able to believe in God for the promise concerning the seed, he could not believe in Him for the promise concerning the land.
[101]  GOD CONFIRMING HIS PROMISE BY MAKING A COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM THROUGH CHRIST
[102]  TWO BIRDS SIGNIFYING THE RESURRECTED CHRIST The two birds, neither of which was killed, signify the resurrected, living Christ Lev 14:6-7 .
[103]  This resurrected Christ is mainly in His divinity because, according to the Bible, a dove in typology signifies the Holy Spirit John 1:32 .
[104]  Therefore, while the cattle typify Christ in His humanity, the birds typify Him in His divinity.
[105]  So the birds in Genesis 15 signify the heavenly Christ, the Christ who came from and who still is in heaven John 3:13 , the Christ who was and who still is living.
[106]  AS FOWL FROM THE AIR, SATAN AND HIS ANGELS COMING TO MAKE CHRIST OF NONE EFFECT When the sacrifices were made ready, the fowl from the air came down trying to eat them v. 11 . This signifies that Satan and his angels come to make Christ of none effect for the church life Gal 5:2, 4 . Today Satan and his angels 2 Cor 11:13-15 are doing their best to rob Christians of the enjoyment of Christ for the church life Col 2:8 . As Abraham drove the fowl away, so we must drive Satan and his angels away from what Christ is to us for the church life.
[107]  When Abraham was in this kind of situation, God came in. Verse 17 says, "And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a torch of fire that passed between those pieces" v. 18, Heb . God did not come in a very lovely way but as a smoking furnace and as a flaming torch.
[108]  THE CALLED ONE IDENTIFIED WITH CHRIST BY OFFERING HIM TO GOD Whenever people offered something to God in the Old Testament, they laid their hand upon the sacrifice, signifying their union or identification with it.
[109]  God's asking Abraham to offer the cattle and birds to Him implied that Abraham had to be one with all of the things that he offered to God.
[110]  God seemed to be saying to him, "Abraham, you must be in union with all of the things that you offer to Me. You must be identified with the cattle and the birds." This indicates that we also have to be cut in Christ's being cut and crucified in His crucifixion.
[111]  FROM ISHMAEL'S PERSECUTION OF ISAAC TO THE EXODUS OUT OF EGYPT History proves that Abraham's seed did suffer affliction for a period of four hundred years beginning with Ishmael's persecution of Isaac 21:9; Gal 4:29 about 1891 B.C. until the exodus out of Egypt about 1491 B.C.
[112]  Ishmael's mocking of Isaac was the start of the affliction of Abraham's seed that was to continue for four hundred years.
[113]  10 KNOWING GRACE FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S PURPOSE THE ALLEGORY OF THE TWO WOMEN God said unto Abraham, Sarah shall her name be.
[114]  And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
[115]  Genesis 17:15-16, 18 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one of the maidservant and one of the free woman.
[116]  Although Abraham was not free to argue with God, within himself he probably said to God, "God, You don't need to promise me over and over again that You will give me a boy.
[117]  You already told me that my descendants will become a great nation.
[118]  You have told me three times that I would have a seed, but why don't You do anything?
[119]  God, don't You realize that one action is better than a thousand words?
[120]  THE FREEWOMAN, SARAH, SIGNIFYING THE COVENANT OF PROMISE GRACE
[121]  Sarah, the freewoman, signifies the covenant of promise Gal 4:23 .
[122]  In that covenant God promised that He would give Abraham the seed, without having any intention that Abraham needed to do anything in order to have it.
[123]  It was when the children of Israel ignored God's work of grace upon them and attempted to please God by themselves that the law was brought in. When man is ignorant of God's grace, he will always endeavor to do something to please God, and this brings in the law, of which Hagar, the bondwoman, the improper wife of Abraham, was the symbol.
[124]  THE PRODUCE ISHMAEL BY THE EFFORT OF THE FLESH WITH THE LAW
[125]  After we were saved, we came to realize that God wants us to live a Christ-like life, a heavenly life, a victorious life, a life that constantly pleases God and glorifies Him.
[126]  Yes, God does want us to live such a life, but He will work Christ into us to live for us a heavenly life to please Him and glorify Him.
[127]  So firstly we rely upon our Lot, that which we brought with us from our natural background, trying to use him to fulfill God's purpose in living a heavenly life for the glory of God.
[128]  Genesis 17:1, 5, 10 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those in uncircumcision who believe, that righteousness might be accounted to them also.
[129]  Genesis 17:1 says, "And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the all-sufficient God; walk before me, and be thou perfect" Heb .
[130]  In chapter sixteen, Abraham did not walk before God; he walked before Sarah, Hagar, and Ishmael.
[131]  In 17:5 God said to Abraham, "Neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee."
[132]  In order for us to have God added into us and to be broadened we need to be circumcised.
[133]  The covenant that God made with Abraham in Genesis 15 was confirmed in Genesis 17 with circumcision.
[134]  There was no need for God to confirm it again, for He had confirmed it once already, but it had to be confirmed from Abraham's side.
[135]  While God was faithful to His covenant, Abraham was not because he had used his natural strength to produce Ishmael.
[136]  Since Abraham's use of his natural energy with Hagar to produce Ishmael was the cause of the trouble, God confirmed His covenant by having Abraham circumcised 17:9-11, 13 .
[137]  Colossians 2:11-12 says, "In whom also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ, buried together with Him in baptism, in whom also you were raised together through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from among the dead."
[138]  In 17:15-21 we see the birth of Isaac promised more definitely than ever before.
[139]  We know that it is more definite because the name Isaac was mentioned and his mother was designated.
[140]  In the foregoing chapters, God said that He would give Abraham a seed and that Abraham would bring forth the seed, but God did not mention that the seed would be out of Sarah.
[141]  But in these verses we see that God promised in a definite way that the seed would be Isaac and that Isaac would be born of Sarah.
[142]  12 KNOWING GRACE FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S PURPOSE THE UNVEILING OF THE DIVINE TITLE AND THE CHANGING OF HUMAN NAMES FOR THE FULFILLING OF GOD'S PURPOSE The Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God.
[143]  In order to have a collective people as His expression, God created the universe and within the universe, as its center, He created man in His image with the intention that man would express Him and represent Him so that He may have a dominion on earth as His kingdom.
[144]  By coming into you, I will have you crucified and then I will make you alive by, with, and for Me. Are you willing for this?" Abraham did not wait for God to do this, but, as Genesis 16 reveals, he acted on his own to bring forth a seed.
[145]  Our mind may be bothered at the thought of such a divine drinking.
[146]  The first time that I gave a message on the eating of Jesus was in 1958.
[147]  After that message, a very highly educated brother said to me, "Brother Lee, that message was very good, but the term eating Jesus' is too wild."
[148]  Although I would prefer to liken God to a nice, tender, gentle mother with a loving breast, it is more meaningful to liken God to a cow with a rich udder, as the Scripture implies.
[149]  Although religion tells us that we must do certain things for God, what God wants us to do is to take Him in as our supply so that He may become our constituent and that we may become one with Him.
[150]  Immediately after the divine title was revealed to Abraham, God told him that his name was to be changed 17:5 .
[151]  By the Lord's mercy, we have no confidence in ourselves or in anyone else.
[152]  We do not have confidence in people because we have learned that no one is qualified to fulfill God's purpose.
[153]  13 KNOWING GRACE FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S PURPOSE CIRCUMCISION FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S PURPOSE And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.
[154]  This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
[155]  Genesis 17:9-10 In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.
[156]  TO PUT OFF OUR FLESH What is the significance of circumcision?
[157]  NOT OUTWARDLY IN THE FLESH, IN THE LETTER, BUT INWARDLY OF THE HEART, IN THE SPIRIT
[158]  14 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD COMMUNION WITH GOD ON THE HUMAN LEVEL And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, and said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant.
[159]  Genesis 18:1-3 And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness"; and he was called the friend of God.
[160]  In this message we come to Genesis 18, which contains an intimate record of Abraham's experience with God.
[161]  If we take an overall view of Abraham's experience with God as found in chapter eleven through chapter twenty-four, we shall see that his experience is in four major sections.
[162]  But the more we experience Him, the more we realize that He comes in a human form, the same as we are.
[163]  If God had not come to Abraham in such a human form, how could Abraham have been called His friend?
[164]  Genesis 18 reveals that Abraham and God spoke with one another like friends.
[165]  Abraham said to Him, "My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree" vv.
[166]  Which do you think is more pleasant for God to sit on His throne demanding that we bow down to Him and worship Him, or for God to sit under a tree and wash His feet?
[167]  No human being could have known at that time that Sarah was laughing within, but the Lord said, "Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?" v. 13 . At this juncture, the Lord clearly unveiled to Abraham that He was Jehovah God by saying, "Is anything too marvelous for the Lord Jehovah ?" When Sarah denied laughing He said, "Nay; but thou didst laugh" v. 15 , indicating that He was the omniscient God, the One who knows everything, even what is in man's heart.
[168]  Abraham's fellowship with God began after he was circumcised and had been terminated 17:24-27 .
[169]  He had not only been called and learned to live by faith in God for his existence, but he had learned to reject and deny his natural strength and to trust in God for everything for the fulfillment of His purpose.
[170]  After becoming such a person, he began to live in fellowship with God.
[171]  In his circumcised state, God came to visit him, and as a circumcised person Abraham had an intimate communion with the visiting God.
[172]  Whenever we enjoy a good time with God, having intimate fellowship with Him, at that time Christ not only is supplied to us, but we offer Christ to God, offering Him the riches of Christ for His enjoyment.
[173]  As Abraham was enjoying such sweet fellowship with God, he received revelation from Him regarding the birth of Isaac and the destruction of Sodom.
[174]  These are the two basic things concerning which God will always deal with us.
[175]  CONCERNING THE DESTRUCTION OF SODOM Abraham walking with God to bring Him on the wayFThe second revelation that Abraham received concerned the destruction of Sodom vv.
[176]  After enjoying such intimate fellowship with Abraham, God and the two angels were satisfied, strengthened, and refreshed.
[177]  God not hiding His intention from Abraham As Abraham was bringing God on His way, "The Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" v. 17 . God could not hide His intention from Abraham, but told him of His intention to judge Sodom saying, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know" vv.
[178]  15 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD A GLORIOUS INTERCESSION And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?
[179]  And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
[180]  Since God did not come to Abraham in His glory with His majesty, Abraham did not recognize at first that it was Jehovah God who was visiting him.
[181]  When God came to Abraham, Abraham welcomed Him, providing Him water and serving Him a good meal.
[182]  Although God spoke to Abraham during the preparation and eating of the meal, He did not disclose the purpose for which He came.
[183]  Only when God rose up and walked away from the tent and Abraham accompanied and conducted Him and the two angels on their way, did God tell Abraham of His intention.
[184]  While Abraham walked with them, the Lord said, "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?"
[185]  God could not hide His intention from Abraham, His dear friend and called one.
[186]  Apparently Abraham interceded for Sodom; actually he interceded for Lot.
[187]  God did not mention the name of Lot to Abraham, but Abraham understood.
[188]  The proof is in 19:29: "And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt."
[189]  Abraham's challenge to God was according to God's righteous way 18:23-25 .
[190]  Abraham said to the Lord, "You are the Judge of all the earth.
[191]  If we say this, God might say, "Yes, I am a loving God, but to love is up to Me. When I feel happy, I love.
[192]  16 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD A DEFEATED RIGHTEOUS MAN Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
[193]  Genesis 13:12 And Lot sat in the gate of Sodom.
[194]  This record shows how Abraham was called by God, how he answered God's calling, how he lived by faith in God for his existence, how he was trained to know grace for the fulfillment of God's purpose, how he was dealt with by being circumcised, and how he was brought into intimate fellowship with God, cooperating with Him on the human level.
[195]  As I read through the verses about Lot again and again, I could not find a hint that God ever appeared to him.
[196]  Although God and the two angels visited Abraham, only the two angels came to Lot.
[197]  God did not appear to Lot or reveal Himself to Lot, because Lot was passive, not actively seeking God, and was living in a wicked city.
[198]  He did not follow God in a direct way but in an indirect way and did not walk in the way of God.
[199]  DRIFTING INTO A SITUATION WHICH WAS WICKED AND SINFUL BEFORE GOD
[200]  Once you leave the source of spiritual influence, you will automatically go downhill.
[201]  Lot's children were corrupted by living in the wicked city.
[202]  The word of the angels in 19:12 indicates that Lot might have had sons as well as daughters.
[203]  17 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD A PILLAR OF SALT And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
[204]  Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven; and he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
[205]  But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
[206]  As we have already pointed out, there is no doubt that Lot's wife was saved from destruction.
[207]  BELIEVERS WHO LIVE IN THE WORLD AS THE WORLDLY PEOPLE AND SEEK TO SAVE THEIR SOUL
[208]  CHILDREN OF GOD WHO DO NOT ABIDE IN THE LORD AS THE ANOINTING TEACHES
[209]  18 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THE SEED BY INCEST Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
[210]  And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
[211]  Let us now consider these six points in more detail.
[212]  Based upon the principle that everything in the book of Genesis is a seed, we may say that Abraham's tent, in which he had intimate fellowship with God on the human level, was a miniature of the tabernacle which God commanded Abraham's descendants to build as His dwelling place on earth.
[213]  DRIFTED INTO THE WICKED CITY After Lot's group had left God's witness and testimony, they drifted into the wicked city of Sodom 13:12-13; 19:1 .
[214]  If you leave the church life, you will be defeated.
[215]  Like a piece of driftwood that cannot control its direction but is carried along by the current, you will drift with the tide of this age and float downward until you find yourself in a wicked city.
[216]  We have seen that the mother, who, as the wife, should have been the helper in life, became a pillar of salt because of her worldliness 19:26 .
[217]  When Lot's family came into the cave, there was no function of life, for there was no function of the proper wife.
[218]  19 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THE HIDDEN WEAKNESS AND A SHAMEFUL INTERCESSION And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country.
[219]  Genesis 20:1 Beautiful in elevation, The joy of the whole earth, Is Mount Zion, the sides of the north, The city of the great King.
[220]  Psalm 48:2 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.
[221]  After Genesis 18 and 19, in which we see Abraham's high attainment in his experience of God, there is a record of his weakness in Genesis 20.
[222]  Can you believe that after having such intimate fellowship with God and after making such a glorious intercession, Abraham could have the experience recorded in chapter twenty?
[223]  REPEATING THE OLD FAILURE After Abraham had left God's presence and had journeyed toward the south, he repeated an old failure lying by sacrificing his wife 20:2; cf.
[224]  Abraham told Abimelech, "It came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother" v. 13 . This hidden weakness was kept within Abraham even after he had been circumcised.
[225]  Then God told him that he must restore Abraham's wife and that Abraham would pray for him v. 7 . God did not inspire Abraham to pray for Abimelech; rather, He indicated to Abimelech that Abraham was a prophet and had the position to pray for the king and his family.
[226]  After receiving the gifts from Abimelech, Abraham prayed for him vv.
[227]  Abimelech might have said to Abraham, "Why did you, a prophet of God, lie to me?
[228]  20 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THE BIRTH AND GROWTH OF ISAAC And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
[229]  And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne unto Abraham, mocking.
[230]  Genesis 21:3, 9 And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.
[231]  Genesis 21:33 But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.
[232]  In the first section we see the birth of Isaac vv.
[233]  3, 6 , was born according to God's promise v. 1 at the appointed time, the time of life v. 2; 17:21; 18:10, 14 . As far as Abraham and Sarah were concerned, the birth of Isaac was a great matter.
[234]  According to Genesis 21, it was not the birth of Isaac that stirred up trouble; it was his growth.
[235]  When Isaac was born, Hagar and her son Ishmael were not bothered very much.
[236]  Rather, God came in and told Abraham, "Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called" v. 12 . The heavenly Judge made the final decision, telling him to do what Sarah requested.
[237]  In the first section of this chapter, we have two seeds, two kinds of persons, and two lives.
[238]  Without the second section, however, we can see neither the source nor the result of their living.
[239]  In Beer-sheba close to the land of the Philistines The well for Isaac was in Beer-sheba, close to the land of the Philistines vv.
[240]  This well, unlike the well for Ishmael, is not near Egypt but at the border of the land of the Philistines and the good land of Canaan.
[241]  With the calling on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal Mighty One Verse 33, which tells us that Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, also says that he "called there on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God" Heb .
[242]  21 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THE OFFERING OF ISAAC 1 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
[243]  Genesis 22:2 By faith Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac; indeed he who gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten, of whom it was said, "In Isaac shall your seed be called"; counting that God was able to raise men even from the dead, from which he also received him back in figure.
[244]  In this message we come to Genesis 22, where we see the climax of Abraham's experience with God.
[245]  In the original text of the Bible, there are no chapters, verses, or paragraphs.
[246]  After the mention of Abraham's planting a tamarisk tree and calling on the name of the Lord, God came in to test him v. 1, Heb . God, unlike Satan, never tempts anyone.
[247]  I say again that after Abraham redeemed the well in Beer-sheba, he undoubtedly did many things, but, except for the planting of the tamarisk and calling on the name of the Lord, the Bible does not mention them.
[248]  A life grown up by the well of the oath with the calling on the name of the Eternal God God did not tell Abraham to offer up a baby or even a little boy, but a full-grown man.
[249]  Genesis 21:34, the last verse of chapter twenty-one, says, "Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days."
[250]  During that time, Isaac grew up by the well of Beer-sheba, growing up by a life of planting and calling on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God.
[251]  Offered to God on Mount Moriah where God's temple was built When God told Abraham to offer Isaac, He told him to go to the land of Moriah and to offer him upon one of the mountains there v. 2 . The land of Moriah was a two-day journey from Beer-sheba.
[252]  In Genesis 22 we see Abraham's obedience by faith.
[253]  When I read this chapter as a young man, I could not understand how Abraham as a human being and a father could have been so bold.
[254]  When God asked him to offer to Him his beloved son Isaac, he did it immediately.
[255]  If Abraham had offered Isaac on the altar, slaying him and burning him as an offering to God, and God did not raise him from the dead, then God's word would have been in vain.
[256]  Traveling for three days Verse 4 indicates that Abraham traveled for three days, for we are told that on the third day he saw the appointed place afar off.
[257]  In the eyes of God and according to Abraham's feeling, Isaac had been killed for three days.
[258]  On the third day Abraham not only offered Isaac; he also received him back.
[259]  22 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THE OFFERING OF ISAAC 2 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
[260]  And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son.
[261]  And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
[262]  As Abraham and Isaac were climbing Mount Moriah, Isaac said, "Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?" v. 7 . Abraham replied, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering" v. 8 . Here we see that the son fellowshipped with the father.
[263]  Isaac was replaced by a ram, that is, by a lamb.
[264]  Verse 13 says, "Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son."
[265]  Christ is the Son of God, but when He was killed on the cross, He was replaced by the Lamb of God.
[266]  WITH THE SEED MULTIPLIED Abraham was blessed by God.
[267]  23 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THE DEATH AND BURIAL OF SARAH Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
[268]  And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you .
[269]  Genesis 23:2-4 By faith Abraham dwelt as a foreigner in the land of promise as in a foreign land, making his home in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise; for he eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God.
[270]  At the end of chapter twenty-two, Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac were dwelling at Beer-sheba, undoubtedly living near the covenanted well and the tamarisk tree.
[271]  This was a miniature of the church life, for the church life is always by a well of living water and a tamarisk tree.
[272]  Although Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac were living at Beer-sheba, she died and was buried in Hebron, the place of fellowship with God.
[273]  Abraham, one who had suffered the loss of his dear wife, had a very strong testimony.
[274]  The Hittites addressed him as lord and called him "a mighty prince" v. 6 . The Hebrew words translated "mighty prince" may also be rendered "a prince of God." In Hebrew, the word for "mighty" is the word for God.
[275]  In his own eyes, he was a stranger, but in the eyes of the people, he was a mighty prince and a prince of God.
[276]  Verse 6 speaks of the "choice" sepulcher, referring to the best sepulcher.
[277]  When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He did not have a good dwelling place.
[278]  24 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THE MARRIAGE OF ISAAC A PRACTICAL LIVING IN ONENESS WITH THE LORD And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.
[279]  The Bible reveals that God's eternal purpose is to express Himself through a corporate Body and that this purpose is fulfilled by the divine life.
[280]  Abraham's living was a practical living in oneness with the Lord.
[281]  Abraham did not suddenly have a vision in which God told him that He had a high purpose to carry out on earth, that He needed him, and that Isaac had to be married in order for God's purpose to be fulfilled.
[282]  CHARGING HIS SERVANT WITH THE LORD Abraham did not charge his servant to be faithful, honest, or to do a good work; he charged him with and by the Lord vv.
[283]  Here we see that the atmosphere in which Abraham lived was the Lord Himself.
[284]  BELIEVING IN THE SOVEREIGN LORD Abraham believed in the sovereign Lord, telling his servant that the Lord would send His angel with him and prosper his way v. 40 . Abraham seemed to be saying, "God will send His angel before you.
[285]  Although Rebekah had never seen Isaac, she was willing to go to him without hesitation.
[286]  25 LIVING IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD THE MARRIAGE OF ISAAC A TYPE OF CHRIST MARRYING THE CHURCH And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
[287]  And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
[288]  Genesis 24:63-64 Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.
[289]  According to the King James Version, Ephesians 3:11 speaks of "the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[290]  TO REACH THE CHOSEN BRIDE As Abraham commissioned his servant to reach the chosen bride vv.
[291]  We all can testify that at a certain time the Spirit of God came to us.
[292]  Perhaps you would say, "I didn't realize that God the Spirit came to me.
[293]  TO BRING THE RICHES OF CHRIST TO THE BRIDE The Spirit also brings the riches of Christ to the bride vv.
[294]  After the camels had finished drinking, the servant put a golden ring on Rebekah's nose and two bracelets upon her hands v. 22, Heb . The best way to catch a person is to catch his nose.
[295]  As we have seen, Rebekah responded immediately, being willing to go with the servant to Isaac.
[296]  Although there is within our old, fallen nature a reluctance to follow the Lord immediately, we cannot deny that there is also within us the willingness to follow Him.
[297]  26 HAVING NO MATURITY IN LIFE Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
[298]  And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her.
[299]  For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
[300]  If we consider all these matters, deep in our spirit we shall realize that the Holy Spirit's intention in this chapter is to show that Abraham was not a person matured in life.
[301]  Although he was old in his physical life, he was not matured in his spiritual life.
[302]  DIED WITHOUT MATURITY IN LIFE The intention of Genesis 25 is to show that Abraham did not have the maturity in life.
[303]  He died without this, for as we have seen, he died without blessing anyone.
[304]  Although Abraham was good, he was not mature in the divine life.
[305]  He was called, had faith, and lived in fellowship with God, but, to use a New Testament term, he did not have sufficient transformation.
[306]  According to the book of Genesis, the first person to bless others was Melchisedec 14:18-19 .
[307]  As the book of Hebrews reveals, Melchisedec was a type of Christ.
[308]  But even when Abraham was very old, much older than Jacob lived to be, he never blessed anyone.
[309]  27 INHERITING GRACE The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints.
[310]  Revelation 22:21 Through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand.
[311]  Romans 5:2 By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.
[312]  1 Corinthians 15:10 I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
[313]  Galatians 2:20 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
[314]  In the biblical and experiential sense, grace means enjoyment.
[315]  Our Christian life has three aspects: the aspect of Abraham, the aspect of Isaac, and the aspect of Jacob.
[316]  In the aspect of Abraham we cannot see much enjoyment.
[317]  Although Christ has come and grace has come with Him, and although we have been brought into the grace in which we stand, the greatest frustration to this grace is you and I. Hence, before we can have the experience of Isaac, we need Abraham who represents the first aspect of the experience of life.
[318]  If we only had Abraham without Isaac, we would be very disappointed with Abraham's record.
[319]  We would say, "What is the good of being the father of faith if it is only a matter of suffering loss?"
[320]  But once we see the experience of Isaac, we shall say, "Now I understand why Abraham suffered the loss of so much.
[321]  All the negative experiences of Abraham were for the positive enjoyment with Isaac."
[322]  As we have seen, God's intention is to work Himself into a corporate man that He might have a corporate expression.
[323]  This is the basic concept of the divine revelation in the Bible.
[324]  God called Abraham with the purpose of working Himself into him, but Abraham had a strong self.
[325]  After Abraham's natural strength and self-effort were dealt with by God, Isaac was born 17:15-19; 18:10-14; 21:1-7 .
[326]  This implies that Isaac was born of grace, which is represented by Sarah Gal 4:24-28, 31 .
[327]  28 RESTING AND ENJOYING Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
[328]  Genesis 24:63-64 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.
[329]  Although enjoyment is our destiny, we must still take care of the place where we have the enjoyment.
[330]  Let us consider the names of the places where Isaac had enjoyment.
[331]  We have seen that Isaac enjoyed all the wells.
[332]  29 HAVING NATURAL WEAKNESS AS ABRAHAM AND LIVING IN THE NATURAL LIFE AS JACOB Abraham journeyed from there toward the south country, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
[333]  And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister.
[334]  And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister Genesis 26:6-7 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
[335]  When do you enjoy grace more when you feel that you are spiritual and good in the eyes of God, or when you are down and feel that you are absolutely unworthy?
[336]  I have enjoyed grace the most when I have been down.
[337]  But we should not say, "Let us be down that we may enjoy grace the most."
[338]  As we have seen, Isaac had the same natural weakness as Abraham cf.
