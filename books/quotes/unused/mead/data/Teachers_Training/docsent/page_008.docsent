   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Understanding Ephesians 6:17 Experientially</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this juncture I would ask you to consider how, in a practical way, the word of the Bible can become the sword of the Spirit for fighting against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Can you give an illustration of this or a testimony concerning it?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 6:12 reveals that our enemies are the evil spirits, "the world-rulers of this darkness," "the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Can you testify from your experience how you have slain these enemies by taking the word as the sword?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to give such a testimony, we need to understand Ephesians 6:17 experientially by handling the Bible in the way of the Spirit and not merely in a mental way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am concerned that in the Summer School of Truth you will teach the young people merely in a mental way, as if you were teaching in a secular school.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all have to learn to teach the Bible in the way of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians, a book on the church as the Body of Christ, talks about the Body life, the oneness of the Body 4:4 , and the Body being the fullness of the One who fills all in all 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to realize that things such as our opinion, thought, temper, emotion, natural life, and point of view are often used by the powers of darkness in the air to damage the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As brothers and sisters in the church, we all have our emotion, thought, opinion, and natural life, and we all have our own point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Quite often we are offended, not due to the wrongdoings of others but simply due to our emotion or opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A chair cannot be offended, because it does not have feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No matter how you treat a chair, it will not be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, it is easy for brothers and sisters in the church to be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Due to their emotion, sisters are easily offended.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose an older brother speaks a word to a particular sister and she is offended because of her emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the evil power in the air comes in to take advantage of her emotion, and she determines not to forget that she has been offended.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Apparently the problem is her emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually the problem is that her emotion has been taken over by the evil force in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the real enemy is not this sister's emotion but the evil spirit in the air that takes advantage of her emotion in order to damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of the enemy's use of her emotion, this sister first has a negative effect on her husband, and then she goes on to have a negative effect on several others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a result, part of the Body is poisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the enemy is to be defeated in this situation, the sister must learn to receive the word as the Spirit, which becomes the sword to deal with the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Being Preserved in the Church Life and in the Ministry by Receiving the Word as the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is something I have learned through many years of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am not a "marble" person who cannot be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have often been offended by others in the church life or in my family life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How have I been able to get through all the offenses?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I get through by receiving the word as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word I receive as the Spirit then becomes the sword to slay the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Apparently the sword of the Spirit kills my emotion; actually it kills the evil spirit in the air who takes advantage of my emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whereas my emotion is killed directly, the evil spirit is killed indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way I have been able to get through the offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When some hear this they might say, "Brother Lee, show me a verse that can kill your emotion directly and kill the evil power in the air indirectly."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not a matter of a particular verse that touches our emotion but a matter of applying Ephesians 6:17 in an experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose in the evening I am offended by one of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because I fear the Lord, I do not dare to talk about this with others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The next morning I rise up to contact the Lord in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not read any verses that touch the matter of my emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead, I simply begin to read the Bible with the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I may read Genesis 1:1: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As I read this verse, I receive the word in a living way as the Spirit, and the Spirit, which is the word, becomes the sword that kills my emotion directly and kills the evil force indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Spontaneously, the offense is gone, and no damage is done to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, if the offense were allowed to remain, it would cause serious damage to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I believe that many of us have experienced receiving the word of God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Without the word as the Spirit to be the killing sword, there would be no way for us to be kept in the church life over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For more than half a century, I have been traveling, visiting the churches, and contacting thousands of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without the word as the Spirit to kill all the enemies, I would not still be here ministering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I had allowed myself to remain offended with a certain church or saint, I would have been finished with the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have been kept in the church life and in the ministry through the killing of the word as the Spirit.</S>
