   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEPTHS OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those who regard it as heretical to speak of God having a wife know the Bible only in a superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They have not touched the depths of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to know anything, we must know the depths of that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is also true, as we have indicated, of knowing a person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you merely know my outward appearance, not the depths of my being, you do not actually know me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today few preach what is in the depths of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They only talk about what is on the surface, the feathers or the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They do not serve the meat of the Word to others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if you are invited to someone s home for a turkey dinner, do they serve you the feathers and the skin?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You will be served with the meat of the turkey.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, many Christians today are not being served with meat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only the feathers and the skin are being set before them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not be fully satisfied with any kind of teaching or preaching that does not serve the meat of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not give too much credit to those who only present the feathers and the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What we urgently need is to touch the depths of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The God revealed in Genesis 1:1 is a bachelor God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may also say that He is the unprocessed God, the raw God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The sixty-six books of the Bible reveal the process through which the single God has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First He created the heavens and the earth as the environment for this process.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day God was incarnated; He was born of a virgin in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Certainly this was part of the process.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do not regard this as a process, what would you call it?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the process of incarnation, God became a little child.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 9:6 says that the name of the child born to us was the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The One who was born in a manger in Bethlehem and who grew up in the home of a carpenter in Nazareth was the very mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus lived there in Nazareth, a small town, for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then He came forth to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No one really understood Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who thought they knew Him said, Is not this the carpenter s son?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And his sisters, are they not all with us?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where then did this man get all these things?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Matt 13:55-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were not able to understand where He gained this wisdom and these works of power Matt 13:54 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, the Lord Jesus went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Apparently when He died on the cross, He alone died on that cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in the sight of God, the entire universe, the whole old creation, died with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ s death was all-inclusive, for this death terminated everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the Lord Jesus was crucified, He was buried in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then He took a tour of Hades, the realm of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the third day Christ resurrected bodily and spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now, in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This Spirit includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this Spirit we have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, even the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because this Spirit contains the reality of every positive thing, we say that the Spirit is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The compound ointment in Exodus 30 is a type of this all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This ointment was composed of olive oil and four kinds of spices.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The olive oil typifies the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The ointment, however, was constituted not only of oil; it was made of oil to which four spices had been added.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These spices typify Christ in His humanity with His crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The olive oil and the spices were mingled to produce an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This ointment typifies the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The olive oil was single; it was not all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, the ointment was all-inclusive, as signified by the fact that it was compounded of a number of elements.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Genesis 1 the Spirit of God likewise was single, but in Revelation 22 the Spirit is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This Spirit includes all that Christ has achieved, attained, and obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This all-inclusive Spirit also includes all that Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, this Spirit has a counterpart, an increase, an addition.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that the Spirit has something to match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God is no longer single, no longer a bachelor, for He has a bride to match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For this reason, the consummate revelation in the Bible is that of the all-inclusive Spirit with the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The term the Spirit is short and simple, containing just two words.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, this simple title is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Spirit comprises all that the Triune God is, all that He has accomplished, and all that He has achieved, obtained, and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This Spirit also includes the process through which the Triune God has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because God has passed through a long process and because the Spirit is His ultimate expression, Revelation 22:17 does not say, God and the church ; it says, The Spirit and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>QUALIFIED TO BE THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we would be qualified to be the Lord s bride, we must grow and pass through many things.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Being the bride involves more than being the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For example, a little girl is not qualified to be a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Before she can be a bride, she must grow to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>She must also attend school and learn many things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then a man will choose her for his bride.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Different men may have different standards concerning whom they will consider for a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For example, someone with a doctoral degree may want a bride with a high education.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He would regard anyone with less than a master s degree as unqualified to be his bride.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Likewise, the Spirit has very high requirements for His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Will the Spirit take a bride who is immature?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Surely, the answer is no. The Lord will not come for His bride until she is mature and fully prepared for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do not think that as long as we are the church, we are qualified to be the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is similar to saying that any female, regardless of age or maturity, is qualified to be married.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>No, certain requirements must be fulfilled in order for us to be the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is easy for Christians to say that we are all the church.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But when the Lord Jesus comes as the Bridegroom, will we be qualified to be His bride?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord may tell us at that time that we are not yet qualified, that we need further growth and maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This understanding of the Bridegroom and the bride is according to the revelation of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Many Christians have been cheated and even drugged by teachings that go no further than the feathers and skin in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Oh, we must see the depths of the truths the Lord has revealed from His Word to His recovery!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>How I thank Him that He has opened His Word to reveal what is found in the depths!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I praise the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I can testify that I treasure the words, the Spirit and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When I read of this in Revelation 22:17, I want to leap for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I can testify that I earnestly desire to be included as part of the Lord s bride.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Is this not your desire also?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But do you have the assurance that you will be included as part of the bride?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Are you content merely to attend the church meetings as a so-called Sunday-goer?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I do not believe that anyone who is merely a Sunday-goer can be part of the Lord s bride.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When the time comes for the Lord to take His bride, will you be ready?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Will you be qualified and matured?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Will it be necessary for the Lord to say to you, I saved you, but you have not yet grown ?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We all need to grow and mature so that we may be qualified at the Lord s coming to be included as part of His bride.</S>
