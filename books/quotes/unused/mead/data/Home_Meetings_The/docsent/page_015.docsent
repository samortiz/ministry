   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Believing and Therefore Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For the home meetings we need mutuality and speaking for the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But many of you will say, Brother Lee, we just don t have the gift of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank the Lord that He has given you such a gift that you can speak for many hours at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am not so gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I do not have the speaking gift.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Due to our feeling that we are unable to speak in the meetings, we need to consider 2 Corinthians 4:10-14.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In these verses Paul speaks about Christ s death and His resurrection in a subjective way, in a way that identifies us with Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 10-12 say, Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So then death operates in us, but life in you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How could Paul speak in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 13 he gives us the secret: And having the same spirit of faith...</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the spirit of faith ?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Dean Alford in his New Testament for English Readers states that the spirit of faith is not distinctly the Holy Spirit, but still not merely a human disposition: the indwelling Holy Spirit penetrates and characterizes the whole renewed man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Vincent in his Word Studies in the New Testament says, Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The spirit of faith is the mingling of the Holy Spirit with our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Doubts are in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spirit in verse 13 indicates that it is by the mingled spirit that the apostles live a crucified life in resurrection for carrying out their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This spirit of faith was Paul s secret.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 13 continues, And having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not believe your feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not believe your habit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to exercise our spirit to believe that we have experienced something of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have we not experienced the death of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Have we not experienced the resurrection of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we need to exercise our spirit to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, we must exercise our spirit to believe what we have experienced; then we must exercise our spirit to speak what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all need to speak in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps one would say, Well, you know I am just a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I don t know if I have something to speak about.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Maybe I don t.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a lie from the usurping enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The enemy has been usurping us, the Christians, for years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has made us all dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have gone for years without speaking in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now is the time for us to revolt, to stand up and declare to the enemy, Get away from me, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I don t believe that.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am not dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am not serving a dumb idol.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am worshipping a speaking God and He is speaking within me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His speaking Spirit is mingled with my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now I can exercise my spirit to believe that I have experienced Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have experienced something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have experienced Him in His resurrection as my patience, as my endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have experienced Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is my life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have experienced this, so I exercise my spirit to believe in this and to speak what I have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the secret of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the following messages I will tell you how to get the terminology, terms, expressions, phrases, utterances, and even sentences for your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But in this message we have to pick up the matter of the mutuality as the factor in our meetings for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The secret is to believe that we have experienced something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then we have to exercise our spirit to speak what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This speaking will build up the saints and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we speak, we speak by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We exercise our spirit to believe what we have experienced of Christ and to utter what we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Try to practice this.</S>
