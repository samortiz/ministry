[1]  Three Crucial Matters for the Increase and Building Up of the Church CONTENTS
[2]  Every lover of the Lord should be a full-time serving one.
[3]  If we ask them to speak a few words for the Lord, they are unable to speak a clear word.
[4]  Therefore, those who are able to make money should make money for the Lord, and those who can expound the Bible and who have a gift to speak and teach should drop their jobs and serve full time.
[5]  If we want the church to be strong and the Lord s work to spread, we need a group of laboring ones to rise up to preach the gospel, build up home meetings, and teach the brothers and sisters how to learn the truth.
[6]  CHAPTER TWO HOME MEETINGS AND TRUTH LESSONS Scripture Reading: Heb 10:25; 2 Tim 2:2, 15
[7]  After we join the Lord s army, we must know how to serve in order to be for the Lord s interest.
[8]  We must not forget the three crucial matters for the increase and building up of the church, namely, begetting, nourishing, and teaching.
[9]  The gospel is for begetting, the home meetings are for nourishing, and Truth Lessons is for teaching.
[10]  The church baptized many people during the past twenty-three years, but when we subtract the number of saints who moved abroad, those who went to be with the Lord, those who became cold and backslidden, and those with whom we lost contact, we find that our numbers have decreased, not increased.
[11]  We cannot deny that out of thousands of Christians the Lord has blessed us with a thorough knowledge of salvation and a clear understanding of the truth.
[12]  People praise us because our exposition of the Bible has influenced Christians in the Far East for the past forty years.
[13]  As believers who thank the Lord for His salvation and want to live by Him, we should not think that we must drop our jobs in order to serve Him full time.
[14]  The spread of the Lord s recovery overseas began from Taiwan.
[15]  Since then the Lord has blessed us, and we cannot forget His grace.
[16]  The Lord s table meetings should not be longer than one hour.
[17]  According to my observation, even though we spend the time after remembering the Lord to share our testimonies, there is not much enjoyment.
[18]  Many people do not speak in the meetings because they are afraid that if they speak, they will expose their condition.
[19]  After the prayer meetings we can spend half an hour to fellowship about the spiritual principles of serving, how to follow the Lord s leading, how to serve people, or how to take care of the meetings.
[20]  AND BEING FAITHFUL AND DILIGENT Scripture Reading: Matt 24:37-42, 44, 51; 25:1-30 RECEIVING THE WORD OF GRACE
[21]  All Christians love Scripture verses such as John 3:16, which says, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life ; Matthew 1:21, which says, You shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins ; and 11:28, which says, Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.
[22]  Just as we acknowledge that believing in the Lord and being saved are important, we must also acknowledge that the Lord s word in Matthew 24 and 25 is important.
[23]  Just as we love the words Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest, we should also remember the Lord s word in Matthew 24 and 25 concerning the Lord settling accounts with us when He returns.
[24]  In the Lord s recovery the Lord has given us the divine life, truth, and the proper practice.
[25]  If we want the Lord s recovery to spread and increase, we must be strengthened in the matters of begetting, nourishing, and teaching.
[26]  In the Lord s recovery, however, we must all spread the gospel, hold home meetings, and teach the truth.
[27]  PAYING THE PRICE IN OUR LIVING TO GAIN OIL
[28]  We must pay a price in order to gain oil.
[29]  When we fellowship with the Lord in the morning, He may touch our conscience, telling us to deal with our sins against others.
[30]  When we obey Him, we are inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit.
[31]  When we attend home meetings, we are buying oil, and when we teach Truth Lessons, we are buying even more oil.
[32]  If we fellowship with the Lord when we are at home, we will have oil when we speak in the meetings.
[33]  If we watch television instead of enjoying the Lord, our prayer in the home meetings will be without oil, and we will not supply the saints.
[34]  If we do this faithfully for fifty-two weeks every year, the lessons will become the riches within the saints that they can apply, and they will have oil when they preach the gospel, meet in the home meetings, and teach the truth.
[35]  AFTER CHANGING THE SYSTEM THE GOAL OF CHANGING THE SYSTEM
[36]  When we began changing the system, we spoke of our goals.
[37]  We said that we are changing the system to eliminate the traditional Christian way of meeting, to give the brothers and sisters the opportunity to exercise their organic function in the meetings, to support the brothers and sisters who meet regularly, to recover the ones who have not met for a long time, and to bring in new ones.
[38]  By doing this, the church can multiply and increase, and the Lord s recovery will have a future.
[39]  ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MEETINGS The General Meeting on Lord s Day Mornings
[40]  Even though we changed the system, we still consider the Lord s Day morning meetings to be important.
[41]  We hope that all the churches will have a general meeting on the Lord s Day.
[42]  We emphasize this matter because some of the older brothers and sisters, who have been meeting with us for a long time, cannot get used to the district meetings or even to the small groups, and we cannot force them to like these meetings.
[43]  For the sake of these brothers and sisters we need a meeting on the Lord s Day.
[44]  Genesis 1 speaks of God s creation and says that the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters v. 2 . Other portions of the Old Testament also refer to the Spirit.
[45]  Apart from the general big meetings and the meetings to teach Truth Lessons, we also need a meeting every Lord s Day to remember the Lord as our source and to fellowship with Him.
[46]  In this meeting we must learn to fellowship with the Lord and remember Him as our source.
[47]  Because we belong to the Lord, we must have a meeting to remember Him.
[48]  I hope that every meeting hall will have a general big meeting every Lord s Day morning as well as a meeting for teaching Truth Lessons.
[49]  According to our present situation, we cannot have the bread-breaking meeting in every home even though the saints in the initial church life broke bread from house to house Acts 2:46 .
[50]  Whether for the sake of the church or for our proper human living, we should have one evening a week to open our home for the Lord and let our friends and neighbors know that we are Christians who fear God.
[51]  However, if we do not practice this, when we go to meet the Lord, He will ask us whether we preached the gospel to our relatives, and we will not be able to say anything in response.
[52]  By changing the system, we are overthrowing the ordinances of Christianity, in which a few people replace the function of the other members of the Body of Christ.
[53]  We have been influenced by degraded Christianity to the extent that we are nearly beyond rescue.
[54]  Starting from today, we must reverse our old habit of not speaking in the meetings by everyone speaking for the Lord in the meetings.
[55]  Some of us never speak the Lord s word in our homes; we do not speak the Lord s word to our children.
[56]  We are very happy when a few people are saved, because we do not speak, we do not have new ones for the increase of the church, and we are not spreading.
[57]  If we all speak for the Lord and speak His word every day in our homes and in every place, people will be amazed at the kind of people we are, the number of new believers will increase, and we will spread.
[58]  Even though the people of God in the Old Testament did not receive the grace that we receive, Joshua was able to say, As for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah Josh 24:15 .
[59]  Nothing gives us more blessing than opening our homes for the Lord.
[60]  When they were in Rome, the church in Rome met in their home Rom 16:3-5 , and when they were in Ephesus, the church in Ephesus met in their home Acts 18:18-19; 1 Cor 16:19 .
[61]  We should have not only the Bible but also our publications, and we should discuss the things of the Lord all day long.
[62]  Even though we do not need to be too frugal, and we should take care of the needs of our family, we must still offer our money to the Lord for His use.
[63]  If we all speak for the Lord, no one can be the head to restrict, rule over, hinder, or control the other saints, and if we are freed from bondage to open our homes for meetings, our relatives, friends, and neighbors will be saved.
[64]  The most effective way is for the full-time trainees to coordinate with these brothers and sisters and go with them to knock on doors and visit people.
[65]  The saints can go out in the gospel, and they can also support the full-time brothers and sisters so that the full-time serving ones can offer all their time.
[66]  The church is like an army fighting for the kingdom of God on the earth; therefore, we must give our all our strength, time, and money for God s interest on the earth.
[67]  We must spread the preaching of the gospel because we live in this age and we have received a burden from the Lord to spread His recovery.
[68]  We need to go so that the Gentiles can become not only believers but also the Lord s disciples, that is, those who spread the Lord s kingdom.
[69]  We need to exercise faith toward the Lord, and look to Him for His blessing and His leading.
[70]  We do not discuss money when someone is sent out for the work.
[71]  In 1933 when I was struggling with the decision of leaving my job and serving the Lord full time, Brother Nee was returning to China on a ship in the Mediterranean Sea, and he wrote me a letter confirming my decision to serve the Lord.
[72]  Even though the Linkou project will require several million Taiwan dollars, we should not put all our money into this project and neglect the development of the work in the communities.
[73]  The brothers and sisters should labor before the Lord and learn how to use their money so that by faithfully giving, they can gradually attain the amount they have pledged to the Lord.
[74]  IN THE WHOLE INHABITED EARTH Scripture Reading: Matt 24:14; 28:18-20 THE THREE GREAT ASSETS OF THE LORD S RECOVERY
[75]  We have three great assets in the Lord s recovery, which no other Christian group has.
[76]  We have the truth, we have churches all over the entire earth, and we can produce full-time serving ones.
[77]  Our understanding of the Bible is a combination of the light the church has received from the Lord over the past two thousand years and the revelation we have received from the Lord.
[78]  After we gospelize Taiwan, every town and village will have churches with Truth Lessons classes.
[79]  Our current practice is to build up the church life in the homes; however, we still need a large meeting hall.
[80]  Some saints will preach the gospel and do the Lord s work full time; other saints are in the church life and earn money for the use of the Lord s work.
[81]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE NEW WAY BEING A WAY OF BLESSING THE BURDEN IN CHANGING OUR WAY
[82]  Based on our observations over the past few years, we have a heavy burden and feel that we must change our way.
[83]  In the church life, however, there has not been much improvement in the way we meet, preach the gospel, serve, and shepherd the brothers and sisters, even though there are many things that can be improved and need to be changed.
[84]  When we go to the home meetings, we should not merely exchange greetings.
[85]  In every meeting we should use the Life Lessons to inject the new ones with life.
[86]  Whenever we go to a home meeting, we are doctors making house calls to give injections.
[87]  In the meeting we obtain a diagnosis based on their need, and we give them an injection of the nutrients that they are lacking.
[88]  If they are lacking vitamin C, we give them vitamin C. After twenty minutes we may give them an injection of vitamin B. Then our time with them will not be a waste.
[89]  In every meeting we should inject the new ones with nutrients when we speak with them, pray with them, and pray-read with them.
[90]  These results show that it is possible to preach the gospel by door-knocking and to nourish the new ones in home meetings.
[91]  Before we beget children, we do not know that we love children, but after giving birth to a child, as we look at him and feed him, we feel that he is very lovely, and we love him more.
[92]  The key to turning the church life from the old way of meeting to the new way is to go door-knocking and have home meetings.
[93]  We should immediately make an appointment to meet with those whom we baptize.
[94]  We have heard many messages in the past, but we are still unable to speak.
[95]  Whether or not we can speak, we should all speak in the home meetings.
[96]  After some people believe in the Lord, they do not want to destroy their idols.
[97]  But what should we do when a person believes in the Lord and knows that he can no longer worship idols but still wants to keep them?
[98]  When they express such a desire, we should not hesitate; rather, we should invite them to the Lord s table to break bread with us so that they can touch the atmosphere of loving the Lord in the church.
[99]  In principle, whenever the new ones ask a question, we must give them a clear explanation.
[100]  In addition, from the time that they are baptized, we should take the new ones door-knocking with us so that they can learn how to sing the hymns, read the Bible, and lead the meetings.
[101]  If we will do this, after a year and a half, the new ones will be able to do everything that we do.
[102]  We preached the gospel, but not many people were saved; we cared for people, but not many people remained; and we visited people, but there was no result.
[103]  They know that we do not want to cheat them; instead, we desire to bring the Lord Jesus to them and to give them the Bible, truth, and light so that they can receive salvation.
[104]  AND GIVING PEOPLE FOOD BEING CONSIDERATE OF ONE ANOTHER
[105]  We should not criticize the elders by asking why they do not attend the training or why they do not go door-knocking when the saints go door-knocking.
[106]  Before we began to change the system, our condition was only slightly different from that of Christianity.
[107]  We did not refer to the brother as a preacher; rather, we referred to him as a speaking brother, as one who speaks from the platform, or as one who ministers the word.
[108]  The evil and slothful slave said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow v. 24 . When we are in the Lord s work, the Lord requires us to do what we are unable to do.
[109]  Even Christians who have believed in the Lord for many years do not understand the precious names of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[110]  We should all do our best to serve when we have the opportunity, and we should do our best to serve when we do not have the opportunity; we should look for the opportunity.
[111]  THE OPERATION OF EACH ONE PART Scripture Reading: Eph 4:16; Col 2:19 THE JOINTS AND SINEWS
[112]  Ephesians 4:16 says, Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[113]  If we do not love the Lord, we should give ourselves to love the world, but if we love the Lord, we must give ourselves for this.
[114]  We should all consider before the Lord what the church should do.
[115]  We should not say that we are a new believer, our gift is small, we do not understand the truth, or we do not have a function.
[116]  The newly baptized brothers and sisters will come to the meeting halls to meet with everyone one Lord s Day every month.
[117]  We hope that the responsibility for the home meetings will be transferred from the full-time trainees to the brothers and sisters in the church.
[118]  First, the meeting halls can coordinate with the training center so that the local brothers and sisters can go with the trainees to the home meetings.
[119]  In this way the brothers and sisters will see what the trainees are doing, and they will meet the new ones in the home meetings.
[120]  Prayer: Lord, we look to You and ask You to take us through this crucial stage.
[121]  Give us an inward sense related to how we should proceed with the home meetings and the church meetings so that we can be clear and have the same burden.
[122]  Lord, speak through every person during this time of fellowship so that we can touch Your heart s intention and Your way in our fellowship.
[123]  Christianity has been on the earth for two thousand years, but the gospel still has not been preached to all the corners of the earth.
[124]  Our present need is to obtain a large meeting hall.
[125]  Our numbers are constantly increasing, and even though we emphasize home meetings, we still need corporate meetings at least once a month.
[126]  We then had another meeting with the saints, but because we did not want this to be a financial burden on the saints, we gave the example of the meeting hall of the church in Pingtung and asked the saints to make contributions for the building of the meeting hall at Linkou.
[127]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN CRUCIAL POINTS CONCERNING THE ADVANCE AND PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY LEADING FOR THE CHURCH
[128]  Since we began to change the system to the new way in October 1984, we have released almost fifty messages concerning the practice of the new way.
[129]  However, because I was busy working on the Recovery Version of the New Testament in Chinese, I was not able to give the church much leadership or help, nor was I able to give much help to the full-time training.
[130]  Last summer we spent all our energy on a college conference and training, and about ten days ago we had a special gospel meeting for the young people in a stadium.
[131]  There are still brothers and sisters who are not willing to meet in the homes, because they feel that the home meetings lack flavor and are small and troublesome.
[132]  We also have saints who feel that after working six days a week, they should come to the Lord s Day meeting to listen to a message and relax.
[133]  However, some of the home meetings have lost their momentum because the saints who usually speak in these meetings are knocking on doors to preach the gospel, and the remaining saints in the home meetings do not usually speak.
[134]  Since the time of the Reformation of Martin Luther, most of the gospel revivals in Christianity eventually were followed by a situation of death.
[135]  If we do this, we will spontaneously be able to speak the truth in the Lord s Day meetings, and we will be able to clearly expound justification and sanctification.
[136]  Then later in the day when we are in our small group meeting, we may speak with the saints and say, Brothers and sisters, this morning I read Matthew 18:20, where it speaks of being gathered into the Lord s name, and I really appreciate the Lord s words.
[137]  In this chapter we will consider the failure of Christianity over the past two thousand years.
[138]  RECEIVING EDUCATION AND LEARNING THE TRUTH Reading Two Verses in the Bible Every Day
[139]  The whole world would be in darkness if God had not given us the Bible.
[140]  We each have a Bible in our hand, but not many of us are diligently learning the truth.
[141]  If we want to grow in life and use our gift to supply others, we need to be educated by diligently learning the truth.
[142]  AND TO MEET THE NEED OF THE WHOLE EARTH
[143]  If any of the older saints are sixty years old and begin reading two verses from the Bible a day, they will only be seventy-one years old when they finish reading the New Testament, and they will still be very useful to the Lord.
[144]  As a short-term benefit, if we read two verses a day, what we read will become very useful by the time we begin a home meeting in six months.
[145]  If we desire to be useful to the Lord, we must learn the truth.
[146]  To preach the gospel, we need to learn the truth; to speak with others, we need to learn the truth; to help others, we also need to learn the truth.
[147]  If we do not know the truth, when people come to us with a problem concerning their marriage, we can only say, Our God is almighty.
[148]  IN PHILADELPHIA Scripture Reading: Rev 3:1-6, 8, 15-16 THE CHURCHES SPOKEN OF
[149]  The characteristic of the church in Philadelphia is that it has a little power and has kept the Lord s word and has not denied His name v. 8 . In other words, the church in Philadelphia highly regards the Lord s word.
[150]  The church can be degraded and become Laodicea because the believers may not have much fellowship with the Lord, even though they love Him.
[151]  They have received grace from the Lord, and they do not want to be defiled by sin or to love the world, but they are not inwardly burning or near to the Lord.
[152]  For example, even though we read the Bible in the morning, we may not have intimate fellowship with the Lord.
[153]  If we do not have intimate fellowship with the Lord, it does not make a difference whether we read the Bible.
[154]  When we come to the meeting, we are not living, and we do not open our mouth.
[155]  The Bible reveals that a proper Christian should love the Lord, take Him as the center, and give Him the preeminence, the first place.
[156]  We must be such people, living a normal life; everything we do should be through prayer and consideration, whether it is going to bed, rising in the morning, eating our meals, or taking care of our business.
[157]  If we begin our day in this way, we will live Christ throughout the whole day, and we will be filled with thanksgiving to the Lord.
[158]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 4:10; 5:10; 2 Pet 1:2; 3:18; Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20
[159]  We should not speak idle words, human words, or negative words.
[160]  Instead, we should speak words of God, that is, words of Spirit, light, life, grace, blessing, and wisdom.
[161]  Concerning the home meetings, we have considered a life of pursuing the truth and the importance of being filled with the Lord s word in our living.
[162]  Some say that we cannot gain people, because we do not know how to speak when we go door-knocking.
[163]  It is indeed impossible to gain people if we do not know how to speak when we knock on doors.
[164]  If we fellowship with the Lord every day, labor on His Word and are saturated with the Lord s word, live before Him and genuinely live Christ, and take the gospel as our primary occupation, speaking the Lord Jesus to every person we meet, we should each be able to save one person every day.
[165]  If we fellowship with the Lord every day, are saturated with His word, preach the gospel to lead people to salvation, establish home meetings and small group meetings, and gather together with others to speak the Lord s word, then spontaneously people will be supplied and edified.
[166]  Whether we have been saved for many years or are new believers, whether we are young or old, we must fellowship with the Lord daily, be soaked in His Word, pray, live Christ, and preach the gospel.
[167]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE GOAL OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY
[168]  THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 4:8-16
[169]  In this chapter and the next, our burden is to give a clear and concise presentation of the goal of the God-ordained way and the necessary steps for its practice.
[170]  For this reason we must speak for the Lord according to the high standard of the Bible.
[171]  We look to the Lord for His grace that we would be able to present the new way clearly and completely.
[172]  After we saw the light in the Bible, we were willing to receive the Lord s grace to recover the way that was lost.
[173]  When we read the Bible, we are usually impressed with the things we already know, and we respond to them, but we are unable to understand the things concerning God s heart, even after we read them numerous times.
[174]  Therefore, when we read these verses, we must look to the Lord to give us revelation and light so that we can see the deep things of God in this portion of the Word.
[175]  BUILDING UP THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST Needing Christ as the Head
[176]  To build up the Body of Christ, we need Christ as the Head.
[177]  A body must have a head, and Christ is the Head of the Body of Christ.
[178]  The work of the gifts is not to build up the Body of Christ directly; rather, their work is to perfect the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ v. 12 . Even though these four groups of people work in different ways, they all have one goal the building up of the Body of Christ.
[179]  They also perfect the saints to establish meetings in the homes of the new ones and to lead the new ones to testify for the Lord, to read the Lord s Word, and to speak for the Lord.
[180]  When we have this desire, we will enter into many things, and we will learn to pray, to speak for the Lord, to care for other believers, and to perfect them to do what we do.
[181]  OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-3, 5-7; 19:5, 9; Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor 14:1, 4, 26, 31
[182]  In the previous chapter we saw that the goal of the new way is to build up the Body of Christ.
[183]  When we visit people to preach the gospel, we gain people for the Lord.
[184]  When we speak the Lord s word to others, we must believe that the Holy Spirit is with us, and we must exercise our spirit.
[185]  Before we go out, we must pray, thoroughly confess our sins to the Lord, and ask Him to cleanse us with His blood so that we can be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[186]  We will be able to announce to the heavens and the earth that we are preaching the gospel to sinners with the Lord Jesus Christ, and we will have the authority to command people to believe and be saved.
[187]  The second step in the practice of the new way is to perfect the new believers.
[188]  In the past we were lacking in this matter, because most of the saints did not receive the proper leading and perfecting to know how to lead and perfect the new believers.
[189]  We were not clear that God does not want to force people to attend meetings; instead, He wants us to bring the meetings to people s homes.
[190]  Just as we visit people to bring the gospel and salvation into their homes, we should take the meeting to their homes to perfect them after they are saved.
[191]  During this time we should tell them that we are not preachers who visit people for a living; rather, we have simply received grace from the Lord and have been moved by the Lord s love to lead people to be saved, to grow in life, and to be perfected.
[192]  We must lead them to do what we do in the meetings so that they gradually learn to pray, sing and speak the hymns, read the Bible, and speak the Lord to others.
[193]  As soon as we lead someone to salvation, we begin to meet in his home, and we help him to call on the Lord s name, pray-read the Word, and fellowship with the Lord.
[194]  In a local church with just one hundred people, we hope that thirty saints will be constrained by the Lord to rise up and accept the Lord s leading to practice the new way.
[195]  Lord, we are not merely going out to do a work; rather, we are going out as Your witnesses to prove that You are the true and living Lord, who died and resurrected.
[196]  In our labor in the new localities, we need to gain households, because it is difficult for a church with only single saints to be stable.
[197]  According to the Bible the practical church life is built up in the homes; hence, we must keep this principle in our work.
[198]  Everyone has an opinion, unless he is a stone.
[199]  It is best to wait a day before we express an opinion so that we can be sure that we feel peaceful about expressing it.
[200]  If we do not have the peace, we should not express our opinion; rather, we should wait until we have the peace.
[201]  During the time when we were researching how to knock on doors, as soon as a person was baptized and changed his clothes, we would rush out the door to baptize the next person.
[202]  If the people listening to our gospel are materialistic and despise spiritual things, we should not press them.
[203]  When we go out to preach the gospel, unless we have much assurance, the power of the Holy Spirit, and the Lord s leading, it is best not to force people.
[204]  The people we speak to may have a successful business, or they may be mature and already know that material things are worthless and that they should not be occupied by them.
[205]  Even if we have a clear leading and the spiritual authority to speak a serious word, we still must be careful how we express things.
[206]  With a new one we can read Philippians 3:8, which says, I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.
[207]  Question: After we establish a church in a locality, how should we manage the financial matters?
[208]  THE STEPS OF THE NEW WAY The First Step Preaching the Gospel
[209]  We want to fellowship concerning the new way that the Lord has shown us.
[210]  The new way includes three steps; the first step is preaching the gospel.
[211]  After four years of thorough research, we have discovered that it is wrong to think that it is best to save more people when we knock on doors to preach the gospel.
[212]  In order for the new believers to become living members who are built up together as the Body of Christ, we should not preach a gospel that merely leads people to salvation.
[213]  If we are able to care for four or five people, we should gain seven or eight people through preaching the gospel and give proper care to these seven or eight people.
[214]  After meeting with the new ones in this way, we should bring them to the Lord s Day meeting and to the small group meeting.
[215]  If several households in a neighborhood are saved, we can introduce them to one another and help them to visit one another.
[216]  The new gospel teams will now be composed of six people.
[217]  These six people will spread the gospel in one town.
[218]  The brothers coordinating the gospel work in Taiwan decided that every locality where we are spreading the gospel will be given a van.
[219]  AND THE GOAL OF THE NEW WAY THE GOSPELIZATION OF TAIWAN
[220]  We are full of joy and thanksgiving to the Lord that in an age in which everyone loves himself and desires a prosperous future, one hundred thirty saints are willing to disregard their future for the sake of the Lord s interest and go to the towns and villages for the spread of the gospel.
[221]  By being willing to take this narrow way to witness for the Lord, these young saints have shown that they are absolute and consecrated to the Lord.
[222]  In every place where the spread is going on, there are about forty to fifty newly baptized believers.
[223]  The four full-timers need to work on these new ones until they are stable.
[224]  We need to consider two practical problems that we have encountered.
[225]  First, as much as possible we must avoid the practice of sisters baptizing people.
[226]  When we knock on doors, we should not let the sisters baptize males, but the sisters can be allowed to baptize females.
[227]  When the full-timers were in the training, Monday was always a day off.
[228]  However, during our time to spread the gospel, if we use this day to go on an outing, we will not get any rest, and we will be more exhausted afterwards.
[229]  We should nourish a person immediately after he is saved.
[230]  We must remember these points when we go out to spread the gospel.
[231]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO BEING WITNESSES OF JESUS CHRIST WITNESSING THE CRUCIFIED AND
[232]  According to the revelation in the book of Acts, everyone who is raised up and sent out by the Lord is a witness of the Lord.
[233]  When we go out to spread the gospel, we should live this kind of living so that people can see that we have passed through death; in us the world has been judged, Satan has been destroyed, and our self, the flesh, lusts, and sin are also judged.
[234]  In 1 Thessalonians 1:5 the apostle Paul said, You know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.
[235]  In 1934 I was invited to give a conference in Ping-Yang, Chekiang Province.
[236]  At the time I was suffering from a serious ulcer, and all the saints knew this.
