   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I arrived home safely in the early morning of the twelfth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please do not worry about me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My father is still receiving medical treatment and needs much care.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the past two months, I have met with many difficulties, and I would not be here today but for the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Praise the Lord!</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From Yang Fang</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May 16, 1934</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Greetings to Sisters Chi Nien and Hui Fen also.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>NEWS FROM LIU GUNG ISLAND,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>WEIHAIWEI, SHANTUNG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>AND A LETTER FROM BROTHER LIN HSIEN HUI</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Witness:</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thank God; although our bodies cannot be together often, our spirits are one in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother, I am on this lonely island by the Lord's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the fellowship is sweet, I have seen that the enemy is very crafty and dangerously evil!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I think that the Lord has given me this opportunity to learn how to pray!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In these past few days, I have felt that there is one thing which I do not have inward peace about.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>My name is still registered in a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I think that obeying the Lord is an expression of loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I say I love the Lord with my mouth but do not follow it up with my actions, what good is it?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of course loving the Lord is not just withdrawing my name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I keep thinking that this is also one of the hundreds of things we must obey in the Bible, so why not obey in God's light?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I was originally a member of the Presbyterian Church in Yu Huang Ting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do not know who the pastor is now, nor do I know the pastor's address.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Please write and tell me, and I will send him a letter asking him to remove my name from the register.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hsien Hui</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>April 26, 1934</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord for me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am adding two questions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Please answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>1 Removing one's name from the denominations is certainly according to the Bible, and once one is clear about this, one should obey.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But I am now on an island without a meeting in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Can I wait for awhile to obey?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am afraid this is Satan's entanglement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2 Because there is no meeting in the Lord's name, I sometimes go to the denominations for the sake of listening to the Word the so-called worship .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But every time I go, I do not feel that this is proper in my heart, because there are so many things of man's will that are not from the leading of the Holy Spirit, although the pastor speaks of the Lord's cross and His precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, if I do not go, I am afraid that a few new believers will be stumbled by my condition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My life is not rich, I am spiritually immature, and for me to speak to them about the biblical truth would surely not be according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In summary, after leaving the denominations, is it all right to return to the denominations to listen to the Word because there is no meeting in the Lord's name?</S>
