In Romans 16:25-26 he says that &#8220;the mystery, which has been kept in silence in times of the ages,&#8221; has now &#8220;been manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the command of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations unto obedience of faith.&#8221; There is a mystery, then, hidden in times past but now, according to the command of the eternal God, made known to man. This passage does not tell us much else about the mystery.<p>Ephesians and Colossians further expand the meaning of this mystery. Ephesians 5:32 says, &#8220;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&#8221; There are two parties to this mystery: Christ and the church. Then Paul prayed that the Colossians might fully understand and know &#8220;the mystery of God, Christ, in Whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden&#8221; (2:2-3). The mystery concerning Christ, then, is the mystery of God. Ephesians 3 has three references to the word mystery. &#8220;That by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have written previously in brief, by which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ....And to bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, Who created all things&#8221; (vv. 3-4, 9). By putting these passages in Colossians and Ephesians together, we can see that the mystery has two aspects. There is the mystery of God, which is Christ, and there is the mystery of Christ, which is the church. Christ and the church, then, are the mystery.<h2 class=head1>EXPLAINING THE UNIVERSE</h2><p>A mystery is something hidden, hard to understand, or difficult to explain. Thoughtful people have always wondered what the meaning of the universe is. Why do the heavens exist? Why is there an earth? Why are there plants and animals and so many other things? Why are we here? What is the meaning of human life?<p>Philosophers and teachers have put out a great many books, dealing with this mystery, in an attempt to explain the universe and the meaning of life. They have done a poor job! The mystery is still hidden from them.<p>Scientists, too, have labored to grasp the nature of the universe and the reason for life. Their mentality is exhausted in trying to comprehend the universe, yet they still have discovered very little.<h2 class=head1>EXPLAINING MAN</h2><p>You are also a mystery. Can you believe that there is no meaning to your existence? If there is none, why do you have such a good mentality? Why do you have so many faculties, like two eyes and two ears? Surely your life has meaning. You do not exist merely to get dressed or to fill up on hamburgers!<p>The reason for man&#8217;s existence still baffles the philosophers.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
