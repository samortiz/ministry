<h1 class=msg>Lesson Fourteen</h1><h1 class=msg>THE DIRECT BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST BY THE PERFECTED SAINTS</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>Eph. 4:12-13, 15-16; 2 Cor. 4:1; 3:8-9; Rom. 5:18b; Jude 3b; Eph. 2:15b; 4:24; 4:1</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Being willing and ready to be perfected</li><li>The saints being perfected by the perfecting gifts with the life supply as the nourishment for the growth in life</li><li>Unto the work of the ministry—unto the building up of the Body of Christ</li><li>Until we (the gifted persons and the saints) all arrive	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God</li>	<li>A full-grown and mature man</li>	<li>The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><p>[We have seen that God’s intention is to give the gifted persons—the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers—to perfect the saints that all the saints may participate in the work of the building up of the Body of Christ. These gifted persons perfect the saints to be what they are. This is similar to the professors in a teachers’ college who perfect their students to become teachers like they are. A local church may be likened to a teachers’ college, and the gifted persons are like professors teaching different courses. They perfect the saints to be what they are—apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. The gifts’ perfecting of the saints results in a proper local church.]
