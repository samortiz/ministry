   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD TO ENJOY GOD'S SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This morning, I want to set clearly before you a way to spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In simple terms, this way is just Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that this Jesus is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the end, He entered death, and He came out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the Lord Jesus today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His Spirit is like the air which fills the earth; it is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As soon as a person repents, confesses his sins, believes, and calls "O Lord Jesus,'' the Spirit of life enters into him, and he is saved and changed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every one of us who have truly believed in the Lord experienced this story within.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As to how we should live the spiritual living after this, we should do the same thing we did in our experience at the time of salvation; that is, we should call on the Lord and pray to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today, we know a little more than before.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord is living in us already.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>More or less, we have some experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Particularly when we contact Him and call on Him when we wake up in the morning, we become different inside.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We feel peaceful and calm.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we breathe a few more breaths, the breath of life will fill us, and anxiety and temper will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, we must not think that as soon as we are saved, everything is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a saved person does not call on the Lord, he will be just like an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only when we call on the Lord will we have life, and only when there is life will there be the way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without calling, we cannot have life; there will be death, and we will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I believe every saved person here can testify to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, I hope that you would take up this matter as a principle and would practice it every day and moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way, we will be able to enjoy God's Spirit of life as the way for us to have a spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>GOD'S SPIRIT OF LIFE AS THE WAY FOR US TO HAVE A SPIRITUAL LIVING For Us to Fulfill the Righteous Requirement of God's Law</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's law consists mainly of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first commandment says that we should have no God other than Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everything that replaces the Lord is another god, and such a replacement is forbidden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second commandment says that we must not make graven images for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything apart from God can become an image or idol.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Examples of these things are money, education, and career.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can make idols out of these, and we can worship them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The third commandment is that we must not take the name of the Lord in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fourth is that we must keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For us today in the New Testament, we should keep the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This day should be sanctified to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On this day we should come to His habitation, which is the church, to break the bread, to remember Him, to learn to serve Him, and to speak the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fifth commandment is that we should honor our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Ten Commandments are divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first five were engraved on one tablet, whereas the last five were engraved on another.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The fifth commandment is put together with the first four that have to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that we should treat our parents in the same way that we should treat God, because God is the ultimate source of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, we have the sixth commandment, which says that we should not kill.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is to honor human life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The seventh commandment says that we should not commit adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is to honor human morality.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The eighth commandment says that we should not steal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is to honor human rights.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The ninth commandment says that we should not bear false witness against our neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This sin is worse than the sin of lying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The tenth commandment says that we should not covet our neighbor's wife, his house, or anything he has.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is to deal with the covetousness that is in man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Romans 8:4 says, "That the righteous requirement of the law might by fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.''</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This spirit is the spirit of life, and to walk according to the spirit is to walk according to the Lord's life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Within us there is surely another life, which is the Lord's Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is the way for us to have a spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we call on Him all the time and walk by Him, we will fulfill the righteous requirement of the law.</S>
