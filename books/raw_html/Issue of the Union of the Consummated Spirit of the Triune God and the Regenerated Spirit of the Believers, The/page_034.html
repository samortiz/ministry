<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Concerning the Eternal Economy of God</H2><P>The divine revelation in the Bible is the content of the Lord's recovery. This revelation contains six major items. The first item concerns God's eternal economy (1 Tim. 1:4b; Eph. 1:10; 3:9). God's eternal economy is something that today's theologians overlook, yet it is a very important truth in the New Testament. Briefly, God's economy is God's plan. For this plan, God made an administrative arrangement, which is His administrative management for dispensing Himself through the processed and consummated all-inclusive Spirit into His chosen, regenerated, sanctified, and transformed tripartite men so that they can become God in life and nature yet with no share in His Godhead. Thus they are being constituted to be the Body of Christ and will ultimately be enlarged and built up to be the New Jerusalem as God's eternal and corporate expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Concerning the Divine Trinity</H2><P>The second major item in the divine revelation concerns the Divine Trinity (John 14:9-20; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 1:4-5). Although theologians today also speak of the Trinity, what they speak is not very impressive or complete and is not very scriptural. For the purpose of presenting the truth concerning the Divine Trinity, the Bible expositors invented a number of new terms, such as the economical Trinity, the essential Trinity, etc. God is triune; He has an economical aspect as well as an essential aspect. Although these new terms were not invented by us, because they are quite expressive and meaningful, we also use them.</P><P>What the Lord has shown us in His recovery concerning the Divine Trinity is that the three coexist and coinhere. Although the three are distinct, They cannot be separated. All this is not for doctrinal debate or study but for our experience and enjoyment (2 Cor. 13:14). The Divine Trinity is for the dispensing of God into His chosen people that they may accomplish His eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Concerning the Person and<br>Work of the All-inclusive Christ</H2><P>We have been shown that the third major item in the divine revelation concerns the person and work of the all-inclusive Christ (Eph. 1:23). The Christ who is revealed in the Bible is all-inclusive. Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ is the One who fills all in all. This all-inclusive Christ, as the preeminent One over all things and the One who fills all in all, is the center and circumference of God's economy. By passing through incarnation, thirty-three and a half years of human living, the all-inclusive death, the all-conquering resurrection, and the all-transcending ascension, He dispenses Himself into the believers to regenerate, sanctify, renew, and transform them, and also to conform them to the image of God's firstborn Son, that is, the image of Christ, the first God-man, and ultimately to glorify them with God's eternal glory. They become the many God-men to constitute the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the enlargement and expression of God in humanity for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Concerning the Consummated<br>Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>The fourth major item in the divine revelation concerns the consummated life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; John 7:39; Rev. 22:17). The term consummated implies that the Spirit passed through the processes to become a consummated Spirit. Concerning the consummated Spirit, there are three major and crucial points. First, the Spirit of God has been compounded with a number of elements to become a compound Spirit, as typified by the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. Second, John 7:39 and 1 Corinthians 15:45b reveal that before Jesus' resurrection, in which He was glorified, the Spirit of God had not yet been processed to become the Spirit who gives life. It was at the time of His resurrection that Jesus was glorified (Luke 24:26). In His resurrection, Christ, the last Adam in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is also called the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Christ&#151;the pneumatic Christ (Rom. 8:9)&#151;the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), and the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). Third, in Revelation the Spirit of God eventually becomes the seven Spirits, that is, the sevenfold intensified Spirit (1:4; 4:5; 5:6), to enable the believers to overcome the various degradations of the church in the dark age of the church. The Spirit of God, after being compounded, transformed, and intensified, became the consummated Spirit of the Triune God (22:17a).</P>
