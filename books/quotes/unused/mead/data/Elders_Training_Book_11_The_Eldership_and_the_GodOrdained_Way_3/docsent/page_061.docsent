   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE THINGS TO AVOID IN THE ELDERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to keep a good, excellent, and beautiful order in the church, the elders should remember to avoid three things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, each of the elders should not regard himself as higher, more experienced, or better than the other elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is fully taught by Paul in Philippians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To consider that you are superior or that you are the senior one will damage you and hurt others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, the elders should not exercise any kind of control.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The elders should keep Peter's word in 1 Peter 5:5 and Paul's word in Ephesians 5:21.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Peter 5:5 says, "In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders, and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians 5:21 says, "Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only should the younger ones be subject to the older ones, but also the older ones should be subject to the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus said that He is our only Leader Matt 23:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The elders should not "lord it over" the saints 1 Pet 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no lord among us but the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not think that you are the one who can lord it over the whole congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such an attitude, way of thinking, and practice are altogether ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must avoid this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders need to set up a pattern by taking the lead to serve and care for the church so that the believers may follow v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Third, we should not try to adjust people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I may be wrong in a meeting, and you may realize that I am wrong, but you should not adjust me in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you feel burdened, you could come to me and have a nice fellowship with me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may think that others are wrong, but we may be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may have misunderstood someone and missed the context of what they said.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is best not to adjust anyone in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such adjustment kills the function of the saints, and it also kills the morale and the encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Be very careful about correcting and adjusting others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If someone says something wrong, it is better to let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>People will learn.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By practicing to function in the meetings, they will learn how to function to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
