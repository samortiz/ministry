   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Following in His Steps</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the believers go forth outside the camp to follow Jesus, bearing His reproach, they are following in His steps 1 Pet 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We enter the Holy of Holies to receive grace, and by this grace we go outside the camp to follow Jesus, to bear His reproach, and to follow in His steps.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Peter 2:21 says, To this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model so that you may follow in His steps.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The common usage of the word model cannot fully convey its meaning in the original Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The literal translation of this word is a writing copy, an underwriting used by students to trace letters and thereby learn to draw them .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In ancient times teachers would write letters on writing materials, and those letters became a master copy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Another piece of writing material was put upon the master copy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then children would practice writing by tracing the letters from the master copy onto their copy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Greek word model is the word that denotes a master copy for people to use in the teaching of writing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus has set His suffering life before us as an underwriting copy for us to copy by tracing and following in His steps.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our following in the steps of the Lord Jesus is not by endeavoring to imitate Him outwardly; rather, it is by experiencing the all-inclusive Spirit with the riches of the divine life to become His reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The result of this process is that Christ is reproduced in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As His reproduction, we can follow in His steps.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>BY TAKING THE LORD S YOKE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>AND LEARNING FROM HIM</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The believers enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by taking the Lord s yoke and learning from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Matthew 11:29 the Lord Jesus said, Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To take the Lord s yoke is to take the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not to be regulated and controlled by any obligation of the law or religion or to be enslaved by any work; rather, it is to be restricted by the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father John 4:34; 5:19, 30; 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He submitted Himself fully to the Father s will Matt 26:39, 42 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the Lord wants His believers to learn from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Matthew 11:30 the Lord Jesus continued, For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord s yoke is the Father s will, and His burden is the work of carrying out the Father s will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such a yoke is easy, not bitter, and such a burden is light, not heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Greek word for easy means fit for use ; hence, good, kind, mild, gentle, easy, and pleasant are in contrast to hard, harsh, sharp, and bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The will of God is our yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we have taken His yoke, we are not free to do as we please.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How good and pleasant it is to take the Lord s yoke and to learn from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A. In the Meekness and Lowliness of His Heart</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Matthew 11:29 the Lord tells us to learn from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is meek and lowly in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be meek means to not resist any opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be lowly means to not have any self-esteem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord Jesus submitted Himself to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself or expecting to gain something for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regardless of the situation He had rest in His heart; He was fully satisfied with the Father s will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To be meek is to not struggle or resist but to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To be lowly is to not have high thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lowliness is deeper than humility.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may be humble, but we may still have high thoughts concerning ourselves or our work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence we need to be lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not consider ourselves as anything or that we are higher than others; on the contrary, we should remain in a lowly state.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is to take the Lord s yoke, not in an outward form but in the heart, in the meekness and lowliness of Christ.</S>
