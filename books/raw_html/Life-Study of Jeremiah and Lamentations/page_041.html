<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ISRAEL'S SIN AGAINST JEHOVAH<br>AND<br>JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT UPON ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JEHOVAH THE HUSBAND'S FURTHER COMPLAINT<br>AGAINST ISRAEL THE WIFE'S WICKEDNESSES<br>AND HIS DETERMINATION IN CORRECTING HER</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Jer. 5&#151;6</H1><P>In this message we will consider chapters five and six of Jeremiah. In chapter five we have Jehovah the Husband's further complaint against His wife, and in chapter six we see His determination in correcting His wife.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JEHOVAH THE HUSBAND'S FURTHER<br>COMPLAINT AGAINST ISRAEL (ACTUALLY JUDAH)<br>THE WIFE'S WICKEDNESSES IN DETAIL</H2><P>Chapters two through four of Jeremiah are Jehovah the Husband's complaint against Israel the wife's apostasy, her spiritual fornication&#151;her worshipping and making of idols. By doing this Israel broke the first four commandments of the law (Exo. 20:1-11), which concern her relationship with God. The first three commandments require man not to have idols but only to have God (vv. 3-7); the fourth commandment requires man to have satisfaction and rest only in God and in all that God has accomplished for man (vv. 8-11). Chapter five of Jeremiah is Jehovah the Husband's further complaint against Israel the wife's wickednesses in detail. The details concerning her wickednesses show that she also broke the last five commandments of the law (Exo. 20:13-17), those concerning man's relationship with man. These commandments are concerned with killing, adultery, stealing, lying, and coveting.</P><P>As a priest, Jeremiah was very knowledgeable concerning the law. He knew the Ten Commandments, and he wrote about the wickedness and sinfulness of Israel according to the sequence of the Ten Commandments.</P>
