   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING FOR THE LORD BEING A SERIOUS MATTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must be very careful when we touch the matter of ministering the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not an easy task to touch the Lord s holy Word, so we must see the importance of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My advice to you is to spend time studying the Bible and the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are willing to mine the riches in them, many problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This can be compared to playing the piano; much time and continued practice are required for a person to be qualified to perform in a concert.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This fellowship is not to trouble you, nor is it to discourage you from ministering the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe that many of us are gifts raised up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, I am concerned that we esteem the Lord s word too lightly; we have not given serious regard to the matter of speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only God can create something out of nothing; we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are human beings, and therefore we need to learn continually.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all need to receive the Lord s grace and the Lord s gift.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul says, Fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you 2 Tim 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First and 2 Corinthians, Hebrews, and Ephesians reveal that the gift in us requires nurturing and development.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sooner or later we have to take this way; otherwise, we will never be an outlet for the rich word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At best we will be able to borrow a few main points from others and use them to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we desire to be an outlet for the rich word, we must be saturated with the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord has granted us His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything depends on how we cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I once observed some students in a seminary collecting material for fifty-two sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was to meet the need of being a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After staying in a place for one year, they would move on to another place because they had exhausted their sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they do not move to another place after exhausting their sermons, they would begin to speak on unrelated matters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is better not to speak than to fall into a similar situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>APPLYING THE WORD TO BUILD UP</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are using the same material for morning watch and for the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not a conflict; instead, it is a strengthening and an application.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the responsibility of every member in a small group to apply what he learns from morning watch.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The elders in each meeting hall must also bear this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They cannot rely on the co-workers to promote this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the elders in each meeting hall should regularly visit different small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If they notice that a particular group is falling behind, they should be willing to meet with the group for a while and help lead them to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is what the elders should do until all the small groups are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This practice will help the saints to exercise their organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we depend solely on the big meetings, no matter how much we endeavor, we will not bring the saints into a situation where everyone exercises his organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, if each of us can take what we read in the morning and apply it in the small group meeting, the result will be impressive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The elders must build up the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The co-workers should also devote themselves to working on the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must get through.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we can spend two years to devote ourselves to the small groups and lay a foundation, we will reap a great harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not like holding a revival meeting and inviting a spiritual giant to speak a few messages.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The effect of such a meeting is seen for one week, but it does not last.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Building up the small groups requires real labor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>DILIGENTLY PROMOTING THE SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>AND LEADING THE SAINTS INTO THE LORD S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the Lord allows it, I would like to consecrate three months to helping you build up the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Much is involved in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to build up the local churches, especially in large localities, we must build up the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have no excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must build up the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the small group meetings are strong, the table meeting will be rich, the prayer meeting will be strengthened, and the gospel preaching will be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The small groups are the foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the foundation is solid, we can accomplish much more with half the effort.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some people have been in Christianity for years but know very little.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, if they were to attend fifty-two small group meetings in the Lord s recovery, they would change.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Their knowledge of the truth and their utterance would indicate that they are from an educated family.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all can make this our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not devote time to this now, we will still have to do it in another ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, if we diligently build up the small groups, within half a year all the saints will be getting into God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should labor in one accord toward this goal by diligently facilitating the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then the saints will be brought into the Lord s word.</S>
