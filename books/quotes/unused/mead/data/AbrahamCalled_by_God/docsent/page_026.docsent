   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING IN A SHADOW OF THE NEW JERUSALEM Abraham's tent was a miniature of the New Jerusalem, which will be the ultimate tabernacle of God in the universe Rev 21:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As he lived in that tent, he was living in a shadow of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While he was living there with God, he was waiting for a city, a city that eventually will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Jerusalem, the eternal tabernacle, will replace that temporary tent in which Abraham lived.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Abraham's tent was a seed of God's eternal dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This seed grew in the tabernacle erected by his descendants in the wilderness Exo 40 , and its harvest will be the New Jerusalem, the tabernacle of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God still needs to have such a seed in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all need to be those who live in a tent and who look forward to a better country, a country in which there will be the eternal tabernacle where God and we, we and God, will live together for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Abraham's interest was altogether in a better country.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although God had told him that He would give the land to Abraham and his descendants, Abraham did not care for that.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was looking for another country and for a city with foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, the Bible tells us that this better country is the new heaven and the new earth and that the city with foundations is the New Jerusalem, the eternal dwelling place for God and for all His called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today we are repeating the life and history of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once there was only one Abraham; now there are many.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church life today is the harvest of the life and history of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Abraham's life by faith is presently being repeated among us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all are here building an altar and pitching a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Look at the church life: we have an altar and a real tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a picture of the coming New Jerusalem where we shall spend eternity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible ends with a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate tent, the ultimate tabernacle, in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Maybe one day Abraham will meet with God in the New Jerusalem, and God will say, "Abraham, don't you remember that day when we feasted together in your tent?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Your tent was a miniature of this eternal tabernacle."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Abraham's tent was a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The growth of that seed is in Exodus and its harvest is in Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In principle, there is no difference between Abraham's tent, and the New Jerusalem, the ultimate tent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I were Abraham meeting with God in the New Jerusalem, I would say, "Lord, I remember the day You came to my tent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now I come to Your tent."</S>
