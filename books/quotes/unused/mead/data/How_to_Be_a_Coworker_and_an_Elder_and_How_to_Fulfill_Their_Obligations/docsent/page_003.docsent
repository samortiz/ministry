   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, thank You for putting us in Your recovery to be the slaves of Your children.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As co-workers and elders we all are slaves in Your house.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, only You are the Lord, the Sovereign Master; we worship You, serve You, preach You, and dispense You to people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For Your sake we are willing to be Your household slaves to serve You and take care of Your children.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>O Lord, do speak a clear word to us again in these six meetings; speak something which You have not spoken before and which we have not heard before.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It seems that we heard many things before but did not take them in. O Lord, we pray that You would give us a glorious beginning; glorify Yourself, glorify the Father, and glorify the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>O Lord, we are Your slaves, and we can only bow down and worship before You, looking to You to grant us a good beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>O Lord, we also cannot forget Your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>While You are giving grace to us, he is disturbing us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, we truly hate the evil one; we accuse him before You.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We declare before You that You have already destroyed him through Your death in the flesh on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We pray that You would destroy Your enemy, Satan, the evil one, among us in Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, release Your children, release Your rich grace, and release Yourself that we may receive Your rich and abounding supply.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this conference we want to see how to be a co-worker and an elder and how to fulfill the obligations of the co-workers and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The central burden of these messages can be expressed in the following statements:</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1 The full ministry of Christ is carried out in three stages for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2 In the first stage of incarnation to bring God into man, to express God in humanity, and to accomplish His judicial redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3 In the second stage of inclusion to be begotten as God's firstborn Son, to become the life-giving Spirit, and to regenerate the believers for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>4 In the third stage of intensification to intensify His organic salvation, to produce the overcomers, and to consummate the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a special conference originally initiated by the brothers from Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since I have not returned to Taiwan for many years, they requested repeatedly that I speak in Chinese in this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the past few years I did not comply since there should be no differences of nationalities in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although we still have the language problem passed on to us from Babel, we keep the Lord's word by not having national differences.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Lord's Body there is no room for any nation or race, but He is all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the new man there is only our Lord, who is all the members and in all the members as their content.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since the Lord is in us, we should not have any national differences.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, because we are still in our flesh, language remains a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, although we are releasing the messages in Chinese, may there be no differences of nationalities among us.</S>
