I also went to Wuhan and preached the gospel with the brothers and sisters there. I formally began to stay in C'hang-sha in October of last year. The Lord arranged a teaching job for me, and I have been learning how to serve Him with the brothers and sisters.</p><p>There have never been many brothers and sisters in the church in C'hang-sha. The condition of the meetings has been lifted up during this year, and there is the inward supply. As everyone felt the inward need, we began to formally break bread in remembrance of the Lord on March 12 of this year. There are about ten people who come to break bread.</p><p>I was really burning when I first returned to the inland region. My entire heart was filled with the desire to serve the Lord. At the beginning the Lord really had mercy on me, but later I saw that I could not make it....Thank the Lord for giving me some deeper dealings.</p><p>I hope to learn some Greek during my vacation and spend more time studying the Bible while I am still young. I do not know if this is what the Lord wants. Please pray for me concerning this matter.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Fangzheng<br />June 4</p><p>Mailing Address: 1 Xundao Street, C'hang-sha, Hunan province</p><h2 class="head2">Brother Lie-shan's Orphan (Hweichang, Kiangsi)</h2><p>After my older brother, Lie-shan, left this earth, my sister-in-law remained in Hangchow for three years before returning to her hometown. Our family is very poor and does not produce anything. We depend on manual labor to make a living. My sister-in-law was very thankful to receive our occasional help. She became ill with a tumor in her nose and left this earth last June! My brother had three daughters who are all grown and married. He had one son named Xiang-xin who is eighteen years old. Last semester he graduated from junior high school, and he wanted to attend high school this coming semester, but he was unable financially.</p><p>My brother Lie-shan was the eldest child in the family, and I am the fourth son. Since graduating from the Gospel Hospital in 1924, I have been working in the neighboring countryside of Junlingzhen as a doctor to make a living. I have had some ability to support my nephew in his studies after graduation from junior high school. This has really been the Lord's great grace, and I thank and praise Him for it.</p><p>Because my nephew will not be able to go to high school next semester, he has become mentally ill. For the last two months he has hardly eaten or drunk, and he has become physically weak. Although he has taken medicine, received shots, been exhorted with kind words, and been the subject of many prayers, nothing seems to work. His future is very precarious, and I am very worried. I hope that you pray that he will be healed soon, lest something terrible happen to him.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Tseng Chi-zhong<br />November 27, 1949</p><p>Mailing Address: Jien Min Hospital, Junlingzhen, Huichang County, Kiangsi province</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_085.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_087.html">Next</a> </body></html>
