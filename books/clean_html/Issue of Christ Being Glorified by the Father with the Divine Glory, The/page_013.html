<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Son Coming Back to Be Another Comforter to Make the Believers Live with Him</H2><P>The Son as the first Comforter left His believers through His death and came back to be another Comforter to them through His resurrection to make them live with Him (vv.18-19). This is why He said, "Because I live, you also shall live" (v. 19b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Consummated Triune God and the Regenerated Believers Becoming an Incorporation in the Resurrection of Christ</H2><P>The consummated Triune God and the regenerated believers became an incorporation in the resurrection of Christ. John 14:20 says, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you." "In that day": This is in the day of the Son's resurrection. "You will know that I am in My Father": The Son and the Father are incorporated into one. "And you in Me": The regenerated believers are incorporated into the Son and into the Father in the Son. "And I in you": The Son in the Father is incorporated into the regenerated believers. Here we have three ins. In verse17 we have a fourth in: "The Spirit of reality...abides with you and shall be in you." The in of the Spirit of reality in verse17 is the totality of the three ins in verse 20. The in in verse17 is a general statement, and the three ins in verse 20 are the detailed statement.</P><P>In this message we have been burdened to point out that Christ's glorification produced an issue&#151;an incorporation. According to the divine revelation in the Scriptures God's work in the universe is to complete His economy, and God's desire in His economy is to have a unique incorporation. This is His universal concern. Millions of Adam's descendants have become believers in Christ. God's intention is to incorporate Himself with all the believers of Christ into one incorporation. The three of the Divine Trinity are an incorporation by coinhering mutually and by working together as one. This means that the three of the Divine Trinity are an incorporation by what They are and by what They do. This is the beginning of the universal incorporation, an incorporation which started with God Himself. God's intention is that all the believers of Christ would be incorporated into His incorporation to be an enlarged incorporation. This enlarged incorporation is unveiled in John 14:16-20. May the Lord open our eyes to see that the Triune God, who is Himself an incorporation, has incorporated all the believers of Christ into His unique, universal incorporation. This incorporation is the issue of Christ's glorification.</P>
