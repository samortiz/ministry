   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE THIRTY GOD S GOVERNMENTAL JUDGMENT 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:17; 2:23; 4:5-6, 12, 17-19 A BASIC THOUGHT IN PETER S WRITINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message and in the message following we shall have a thorough review of all the matters in chapters one through four related to God s governmental judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The concept of God s governmental judgment is a basic thought in Peter s composition of this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s judgment as seen in 1 Peter may be likened to the hub of a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the hub were taken away from a wheel, all the spokes would collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Likewise, if the thought of God s judgment were removed from the books of 1 and 2 Peter, these Epistles would lose their basic structure.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many Christian readers of these Epistles may not pay adequate attention to the matter of God s governmental judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reason most readers may pay attention to things other than God s judgment is that their mentality has not been trained to concentrate on this subject in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, John Nelson Darby was an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In his treatment of 1 and 2 Peter he focuses his attention on God s governmental judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether or not we pay attention to this matter in the Epistles of Peter depends on whether or not we have a mind trained to pay attention to such a subject.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many years ago, some of us were having fellowship concerning the main subject of the books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all knew that Matthew is on God s kingdom; Mark, on service to God; Luke, on God s salvation; and John, on life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When someone asked about the subject of the Epistles of Peter, much to my surprise Brother Nee said that these two books are on God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From that time onward I began to consider what God s government is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I said to myself, Isn t the kingdom in Matthew God s government?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is the difference between the kingdom of God and the government of God?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Gradually I began to understand the difference between kingdom and government.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Of course, in 1 and 2 Peter we cannot find the word government.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in these two books we see the means by which God carries out His government.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The means by which God carries out His government is by judging.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, after God s judgment has been completed, there will be a new heaven and a new earth wherein righteousness dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The new heaven and the new earth are the consummation of 1 and 2 Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all need to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we have already pointed out, at the beginning of 1 Peter we have a word concerning the foreknowledge of God before the foundation of the world, that is, in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the last chapter of 2 Peter we have a word concerning the new heaven and the new earth in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that the scope of these two Epistles extends from eternity past to eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These two books consummate with the new heaven and the new earth with righteousness as their contents.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is related to the government of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s judgment began to be exercised in the Old Testament, and it has been continually exercised throughout the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today God is still judging.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the New Testament we see that God s judgment begins from His own household and ends with the burning of the old heaven and the old earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That burning will be the last step of God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When that last step of judgment has been completed, the new heaven and the new earth will appear.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that when God has thoroughly cleansed the universe through judgment, there will be a new heaven and a new earth wherein righteousness will dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a matter of God s governmental judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am burdened that all the saints, especially the young ones, have a clear understanding of 1 and 2 Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In particular, we need to see that the subject of these two books is God s government carried out by His judgment.</S>
