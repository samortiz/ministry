   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SEVENTY ORDINANCES AND DOCTRINE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the divine Spirit has been mingled with the human spirit to produce one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This oneness of the divine Spirit with the human spirit is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because the church is produced by the mingling of divinity with humanity, we may say that the church is a hybrid.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The book of Ephesians also deals with certain negative things that damage or hinder the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reason these things are covered in this book is that Ephesians is focused on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>ABOLISHING THE ORDINANCES</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>TO CREATE ONE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who have been Christians for years know that on the cross Christ died as the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, on the cross Christ crucified the old man, destroyed Satan, and dealt with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that on the cross Christ dealt with sin, with the old man including the old nature, with Satan, and with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, not many Christians realize that on the cross Christ also dealt with the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ dealt with sins and with sin so that we might be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He dealt with our old nature in order to set us free from the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, Christ dealt with Satan so that we may be victorious and overcome the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Finally, Christ dealt with the world, so that we may be holy, sanctified, separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But why did He deal with the ordinances?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He dealt with them in order to create one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christians do not see this point because they concentrate on personal salvation, sanctification, or victory, and pay no attention to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even many Bible teachers fail to point out that in Ephesians Christ abolished the ordinances in order that the church might be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is one of the most important revelations the Lord has given to the church in recent days.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ s death was not only for our salvation, liberation, sanctification, and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His death was also to abolish the ordinances in order to create the church as the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ordinances, commandments, and the law are in the same category.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Apart from the law, we would not have any commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These commandments give rise to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the cross Christ abolished the law of commandments in ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ordinances are related both to religion and to culture and also to human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to our nature, we have a strong tendency toward ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our ordinances match our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more cultured we are, the more ordinances we have.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ abolished the ordinances in order to create in Himself one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not abolish them so that we may be holy, spiritual, or victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a sense, He did not abolish the ordinances even that we may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He abolished them so that the church might come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>DROPPING THE ORDINANCES</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>FOR THE PROPER CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we know the church, we shall reject all ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is the mingling of the processed God with the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here in this mingling there are no ordinances, commandments, rules, or regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more we are in the mingled spirit, in the mingling of the divine Spirit with the human spirit, the more we shall be set free from ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, if we cling to ordinances, we shall be divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christians have been divided mainly because of ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some denominations have been established because of ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you have the confidence to say that you have no ordinances?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Few of us can say this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The young people have their particular ordinances, and the older saints have theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Most of the problems among the leading ones in the churches are caused by ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some Christians have an ordinance, for example, regarding speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After one meeting, a brother came to me very happy because he had not been bothered by a sister who had spoken in tongues in that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I told this brother that even his happiness proved that he still had feelings about speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, his reaction was not altogether positive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If he could be surrounded by those who spoke in tongues without having any feeling about it, that would prove that he had no ordinances concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we would have the proper church life, we must drop all ordinances and concentrate on the mingling of the divine Spirit with the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only in this mingling can we enjoy the genuine church life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Ordinances are particularly related to religion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without ordinances, it is impossible to have religion, for religion is composed of ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But Christ does not want a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What He wants is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, He abolished the ordinances on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some may prefer shouting in the meeting, whereas others prefer silence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But to be either for shouting or for silence is to have an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not be for either one or the other, but for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, according to our nature and upbringing, we are prone to have ordinances of one kind or another.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But as long as there are ordinances, we do not have the reality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The church life does not consist of ordinances, but of the living Spirit.</S>
