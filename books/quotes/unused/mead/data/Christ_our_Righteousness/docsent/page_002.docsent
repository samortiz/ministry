   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BECOMING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once I was talking to a theological student.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I said, "The Bible does not say that we have put on the righteous garment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It only says that we have put on Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Galatians 3:27 says that we have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today we have not put on the righteousness of Christ, but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The righteousness of Christ is something that is in Christ Himself, and it is history.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today Christians come to God through putting on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ Himself has become our righteousness, and we can come to God at any time because Christ lives forever.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How can we, as sinful persons with so many failures, come to God?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why should God answer our prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One sister did not feel that temper was a sin, and she would not deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later, she could not get over a particular matter, and she wanted to have a thorough dealing before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She called me by phone and made an appointment to talk to me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I told her to go and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She took my word and went to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before she went to God, the subject of righteousness was not in her thought.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, as soon as she turned to God, the matter of righteousness came.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She thought to herself, "With what kind of righteousness should I come to God?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then she realized that her temper was a sin, and she acknowledged that she did not have any righteousness of her own.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A new believer very often prays and asks, "What is my basis for coming to God?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose you are in your bedroom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You can dress any way you like, but when you meet a guest, you have to properly attire yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one ever dresses up to go to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is because you are alone when you go to bed, and there is no need to dress up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But during the day you have to meet people; consequently, you have to dress up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same way, as soon as a man comes to God, he considers how he should dress.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a certain member of one's family is sick or in trouble and he is forced to come to God, he often suddenly remembers many sins that he has otherwise ignored.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How do we come to God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Corinthians 1:30 is a great verse in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This verse reveals that a Christian does not come to God through his own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Neither does he come to God with his many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, he comes to God through Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A Christian's access to God is not based on his righteousness or his unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This verse shows us clearly that Christ has become the righteousness of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not something about Christ that has become our righteousness; rather, Christ Himself in His entirety has become our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Something of Christ can never be as absolute and perfect as Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Christ Himself becomes our righteousness, God receives us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The experience of many Christians follows a certain pattern: If they read the Bible in the morning and manage to control their temper during the day, they can pray in a strong way at night.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if they fail during the day, their prayer at night is very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, even when we sin, Christ is still our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fact has not changed, because we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we behave well today and think that we are more qualified to come to God, we are coming to Him by our own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God does not receive us based on our righteousness, much less on our unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His receiving is based on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A Christian does not become more unrighteous through sinning, nor does he become more righteous through doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sin does not diminish a Christian's righteousness, nor do good works increase his righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our righteousness before God is not dependent on our conduct, but on Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our righteousness before God never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Righteousness is a person; it is not a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The righteousness that a Christian has is the living Christ; it is not some dead object.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even if we committed all the sins of the world, our righteousness is still Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sooner or later every Christian must realize who this One is who is his righteousness.</S>
