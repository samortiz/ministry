   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT SEEKING WHAT IS THEIRS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 14 says, Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be an encumbrance; for I do not seek what is yours, but you; for the children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse we have a very important word: I do not seek what is yours, but you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all need to be deeply impressed with this word and remember it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we work for the Lord, we should not seek what belongs to others we should seek them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that we should not seek others money or want their money.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul could say boldly to the Corinthians, I seek after you and I want you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not seek what is yours your wealth, your possessions, your material things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I seek you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At least a few times Brother Nee pointed out to us that if one who works for the Lord cannot be faithful in the matter of money, he cannot be faithful or strong in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many Christian workers, when they come to the matter of money, immediately become weak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because they are afraid that their financial supply would be cut off, they dare not preach certain things, teach certain truths, or rebuke certain sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, they will not deal with certain matters, also because they are afraid that if they do so, the supply of money will be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who have this problem are subdued by money.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not think that we are the only ones who know the truth concerning the church revealed in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At least some others know this truth; however, they dare not practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They know that in every locality there should be just one church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But, fearing that their supply of funds will be cut off, they are not willing to teach this or practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am concerned that when you enter into the genuine ministry for the Lord and are faced with the matter of money, you may not be bold for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is indeed a failure to be influenced by money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a shame and a defeat before the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all must receive grace to forget considerations about money and have the boldness to say to the believers, I do not seek what is yours I seek you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In these verses we do not have doctrines, but we do have a number of very practical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 14 Paul says that the children should not store up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we see once again that Paul was frank and honest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He would not give up his standing with regard to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this verse Paul seems to be telling them, Corinthians, you cannot deny that I am your spiritual father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I begot you in Christ through the gospel, and I have raised you as my children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As your parent, I do not seek what is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a shame for parents to seek their children s money.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Corinthians, I do not want to receive anything from you I want to give to you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>UTTERLY SPENT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, But I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls, even if loving you more abundantly, I am loved less.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this verse spend means to spend what he has, referring to his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be utterly spent means to spend what he is, referring to his being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul was willing to sacrifice himself his soul, his life, his entire being for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was also willing to give all his money and material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus gave His soul for us; He was utterly spent for us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In like manner, Paul s desire was to be utterly spent for the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the saints in the Lord s recovery need to learn this crucial lesson: to receive grace to spend what we have and to be utterly spent for the saints and for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 15 Paul says that he was willing to be spent, even if loving the believers more abundantly, he was loved the less.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul was still willing to be spent for the Corinthians even if he loved them more and they loved him less.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul did not care about their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Their condition could not change his attitude toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here Paul seems to be saying, No matter what your attitude is toward me, I still love you, and I am glad to spend what I have and what I am for you.</S>
