   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these messages we have clearly seen that the revelation of the Scriptures is progressive and consistent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It starts from Genesis and goes through sixty-six books, ending with Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 1, after God finished the work of His creation, He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But for man to be for God he must have an organ to contact God and take God in. This organ is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, Zechariah says that God created the heavens and the earth and the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The whole universe serves God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His purpose is to have a group of human beings that He may work Himself into them so that they might bear His image.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this way God would become their life and content.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God would be one with them, and they would be His expression, filled with all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this purpose, God had to create man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For man to exist there is the need of the earth, and the earth needs the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sunshine, the rain, and even the air are all required for life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without these things, no life can exist.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The heavens are for the earth, and the earth s existence is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the earth were a little closer to the sun, everything on the earth would be burned up, including man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the earth were a little farther from the sun, everything on the earth would be frozen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praise the Lord that the distance between the earth and the sun is just right!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CONTENT FOR THE CONTAINER</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 4:24 says, God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God made a spirit for man that man might worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way God made man was unique.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He did not make anything in His own image but man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A glove is made in the image of a hand that the hand might enter into the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When it does, the glove is no longer empty, but has a content which is expressed by the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we remove the hand from the glove, the glove becomes empty and useless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Its usefulness is just to contain the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the same way, God made man in His image that He Himself might come into this man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All containers are made in the form of the content.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A round item has a round container.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A square item has a square container.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God made man in His image that man might contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, Paul tells us in Romans 9:23 that man is God s vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And what if He should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man was made as a vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This vessel as the container of God was made exactly in the form of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We human beings are not good for anything but God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Anything else does not fit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever else we have tried to fill ourselves with can never satisfy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we called on the Lord Jesus, He came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we all testified that we had found the purpose for living.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To put anything but a hand into a glove is awkward and meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A pencil or a book does not fit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only a hand fits.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul says in Galatians 4:19, My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you.</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God created man in His image that He might become the very content of man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To have the image is one thing, but to have God s life and nature is another.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A wax man is made in the image of man, but does not have man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our parents not only gave us man s image, but also man s life; but God in His creation only gave man His image, not His life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, after man was created, God placed him before the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This indicated that man had God s image, but he still did not have God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Genesis 1 we see the image of God, and in Genesis 2 we see the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God gave us His image in creation, but until we take in the tree of life, we do not have His life.</S>
