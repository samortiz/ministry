<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO ADVANCE THE SMALL GROUPS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH NEEDING TO ADVANCE THE GROUPS</h2>
<p>In the previous message we fellowshipped concerning dividing into groups. The church in Taipei has already formed over four hundred groups. The primary need now is to advance the groups. The church in Taipei currently has about four hundred serving ones, including elders, co-workers, deacons, those who minister the word, coordinators of various services, young full-timers, and part-timers. Every one of these serving ones, whether experienced or not, must be in a group.</p>
<p>From now on the move of the church will be carried out mainly through the groups. The work of the small groups is mainly to restore the dormant saints and to promote the gospel preaching in the homes. Then the groups can promote the gospel work on the college campuses, among the high school and junior high school students, among the children, and in the community. In other words, the foundation of each area of work is the groups. The group is the basic unit and foundation of the church. In order to have a foundation in our work, we must nurture the groups. Once the groups begin to function, every aspect of the work will be carried out smoothly. When the groups function, we can spontaneously bring in dormant saints, and it will be easy for them to be restored. At the same time, we can spread the gospel in the homes. Then we can be aggressive in the gospel work on the campuses, among the children, and in the community. This will result in the multiplication and increase of the church.</p>
<p>Concerning the practice of the group meetings, we are short of experience and personnel, even though we have four hundred groups. This means that every serving one, including the elders and co-workers, should be assigned to help and advance a group. In other words, the serving ones should all serve to advance the groups. If there are not enough serving ones, we should ask other saints to help. For example, the movement of a large truck is slow. If we want it to move faster, it is best to push it. However, as we push it, we will discover that some parts are out of order and defective. Then we can make the necessary repairs so that the truck can run at an ideal speed.</p>
<p>Every serving brother and sister should help in leading a group, but this does not mean that they should regard themselves as a person who is &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; for the group. Neither should they consider themselves as a &ldquo;group leader&rdquo;; they should take the lead only in regard to fanning the gift within the saints into flame. If the fire in a group has not been kindled, the serving ones should bear responsibility to help kindle the fire. If the fire in a group is dying, the serving ones should fan it into flame. The serving ones should fan the gift in the saints into flame.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIVIDING INTO GROUPS ACCORDING TO GEOGRAPHY</h2>
<p>In forming the groups, there should not be groups for brothers and groups for sisters or groups for elderly saints and groups for younger saints. Neither should there be groups for working saints and groups for students. Rather, the grouping of the saints should be according to geography. If there are eight to ten saints who live close to one another, they should form a group. The members of a group should include brothers, sisters, elderly saints, and younger ones, without any distinction. Even the serving ones should be assigned according to geography. In other words, serving brothers should not be assigned to nurture brothers&rsquo; groups, nor should serving sisters be assigned to nurture sisters&rsquo; groups. Furthermore, there is no need to consider whether serving saints are suitable for a particular group. They should simply go and work with a group according to geography.</p>
<p>In order to advance the small groups, we must first drop our old concepts. The only factor we should consider in forming groups is geography. There should be no other consideration. This will limit the impact of preconceptions that can frustrate this simple principle of arrangement. This way of arrangement can be compared to the old-fashioned marriages in China in which the husband in an arranged marriage often did not even know what his wife looked like until her veil was lifted. Nevertheless, this way often produced very stable marriages.</p>
<p>Please do not analyze or doubt the benefit that will come from forming groups according to geography. It will help every saint to endeavor to strengthen and supply each group. After much consideration before the Lord, we believe that we should take this way. We have eaten much of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and our eyes are opened (Gen. 3:7). When our eyes are so &ldquo;open&rdquo; about certain matters, we often hesitate to act. For example, a person who knows everything about the preparation of food is often reluctant to eat food prepared by others because he is afraid of eating food prepared using unhygienic methods. It is better to be blind.</p>
<p>The eyes of some of the younger elders and co-workers are too open. When I propose something, some of them immediately begin to think of possible complications in how to carry it out. For example, before the meeting I said that we needed four hundred brothers and sisters to help the small groups. Immediately, a brother asked whether sisters should lead only sisters&rsquo; groups and not lead brothers&rsquo; groups. This brother has too many considerations. Having eyes that are so open makes advancement difficult.</p>
<p>The principle for arranging the small groups is by geography. We should not say that it is difficult to lead a group that has more older saints. Neither is it necessary to ask an elderly sister to help with a group of elderly sisters. Such thoughts are wrong. Instead, it is possible for an elderly sister to lead young sisters and for a young sister to lead a group of elderly sisters.</p>
<p>We do not agree with special arrangements. When we make arrangements by anything other than geography, we are no longer according to the principle of an old-fashioned Chinese marriage, that is, &ldquo;a match made in heaven.&rdquo; When heaven acts as the matchmaker to put a couple together, it is the best match. Therefore, the elders should not be involved in grouping the saints and the serving ones together in any way other than geography. The church in Taipei has over twenty meeting halls and around five thousand saints who meet regularly. These saints have been divided into more than four hundred groups. Some halls are larger, and others are smaller. Some halls may have only eight or ten groups. These four hundred groups should be divided into eight districts, and every district should have fifty groups. We must still study how to combine the groups into districts for the advance of the Lord&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>We have not yet reached the stage of forming districts. We first need to advance the groups. After the groups begin to function, the elders and co-workers should combine the groups to form districts. Every district should have fifty groups. Then ten to twenty elders and co-workers should encourage the districts. This is similar to pushing an old car. Initially, many people are needed to push it, but once the old car starts moving, those who were pushing can take care of other matters. In the same principle, once the groups begin to function, we will not need four hundred serving ones to push them. We will probably need no more than a hundred serving ones to nurture them.</p>
