[1]  a Kingly and Divine High Priest Scripture Reading: Heb 7:1 8:2 The book of Hebrews is focused on the heavenly Christ, and the chief point concerning the heavenly Christ is that He is a Priest not according to the order of Aaron but according to the order of Melchisedec 1:3; 4:14; 8:1; 9:24; 12:2; 5:6, 10; 6:20: Hebrews is primarily concerned with the priesthood of Christ, and all the aspects of Christ in chapters one through six are the necessary qualifications for Him to be a kingly and divine High Priest, who can minister to us whatever we need and save us to the uttermost 8:1; 7:11, 25.
[2]  The heavenly Christ revealed in Hebrews is the present Christ the Christ now, the Christ today, and the Christ on the throne in the heavens, who is our daily salvation and our moment-by-moment supply 8:2; 4:14-15; 7:26.
[3]  Matt 26:27-28; Luke 22:20 The new covenant consummated with the blood of Christ is not merely a covenant but also a testament with all the things which have been accomplished by the death of Christ bequeathed to us Heb 9:15-17: A covenant and a testament are the same, but when the maker of the covenant is living, it is a covenant, and when he has died, it is a testament.
[4]  13:20; 12:1-2; 9:14; 10:29 As the ascended One sitting on the throne in the heavens, Christ is now executing the new covenant, which He has bequeathed to us as a testament, interceding for us and ministering to us that we may realize, experience, and enjoy all the bequests contained in the new testament Heb 12:2; 7:25; 8:1-2: The new testament, the will, has been validated by Christ s death and is being executed and enforced by Christ in His resurrection and ascension.
[5]  Christ Himself is the new covenant, the new testament, given to us by God Isa 42:6; 49:8: God s salvation, God s blessings, and all of God s riches have been covenanted to us, and this covenant is Christ: The reality of all the hundreds of bequests in the New Testament is Christ Gen 22:18a; Gal 3:14; 1 Cor 1:30; 15:45b; Eph 1:3.
[6]  After His resurrection and ascension, the individual Christ became the corporate Christ; thus, before God today not only is the individual Christ interceding, but the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, the Head with the Body, is also interceding to carry out His intercession 1 Cor 12:12; Acts 12:5, 12; Rom 8:26-27: If we have this view of the incense altar, our prayer life will be revolutionized, and we will pray for the executing of God s purpose, for the carrying out of the divine administration, and for the dispensing of God s supplying grace.
[7]  John 1:14, 29; 4:23-24; 14:6a The will of God is to have Christ as the replacement for all the offerings in the Old Testament so that we may enjoy Him as everything in living and practicing the Body life for the building up of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God Eph 1:5, 9-11; Heb 10:7-10; Rom 12:2: Christ s replacing of all the Old Testament offerings, taking away all the Old Testament types and establishing Himself as everything to us, is God s great will: The Old Testament predicted in Isaiah 53 that Christ would come to be the sacrifice for sin, that is, to replace and terminate the Levitical sacrifices vv.
[8]  The peace offering signifies Christ as the Peacemaker, the One who became the peace and the fellowship between God and us by shedding His blood and dying for us, enabling us to enjoy Christ with God and to have fellowship with God in Christ for our mutual satisfaction with God Lev 3:1; Eph 2:14-15; John 12:1-3; 20:21; Rev 21:2.
[9]  Jesus is the Author of faith, the Originator, the Inaugurator, the source, and the cause of faith Heb 12:2a: The faith of the believers is actually not their own faith but Christ entering into them to be their faith Rom 3:22 and note 1; Gal 2:16 and note 1: Our believing is our appreciation of Christ as a reaction to His attraction Rom 10:17.
[10]  Faith is the unique way to carry out God s New Testament economy 1 Tim 1:4: The believers in Christ are justified by faith, and have life and live by faith Rom 1:17; Gal 3:11; Heb 10:38: By faith, which is the moving and working God in Christ who puts us into Christ as our righteousness 1 Cor 1:30 , we have the divine life according to God s righteousness judicially.
[11]  3:6; 4:9; 12:22-24, 28; 13:20 The church is a living composition of the many sons of God, who are the many brothers of Christ brought forth in His resurrection Heb 2:10-12; Rom 8:29; John 20:17; Heb 1:5; 5:5; Acts 13:33; 1 Pet 1:3: God is our divine Father, and we are His divine sons born of His divine life with His divine nature John 20:17; Eph 1:5; Gal 3:26; John 1:12-13; 2 Pet 1:4: As the many brothers of Christ, we are the same as the firstborn Son; He is divine and human, and we are human and divine Heb 2:11; 1:6; Rom 8:29.
[12]  Since Christ as the firstborn Son of God is God s appointed Heir and we as the many sons of God are His joint-heirs, we are Christ s partners Heb 1:9; 3:14: Christ and we are in one partnership, sharing the same interests in the divine corporation Christ and the church Eph 5:32.
[13]  Message Twelve Enter within the Veil and Go outside the Camp Scripture Reading: Heb 6:19-20; 13:13; Exo 33:7-11 The goal and ultimate conclusion of the book of Hebrews is that we would enter within the veil and go outside the camp Heb 6:19-20; 13:13: To enter within the veil means to enter into the Holy of Holies, where the Lord is enthroned in glory, and to go outside the camp means to come out of religion, whence the Lord was cast in rejection: The camp signifies the organization of religion, which is earthly and human.
