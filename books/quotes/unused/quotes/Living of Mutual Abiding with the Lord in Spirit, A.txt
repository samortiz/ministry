Since every religion has its book of religious teachings, it seems Christianity also has its book, which is the Bible
In reality the Bible is entirely a book on life, and this life which is referred to in the Bible is the Triune God as our life
In the first two chapters of the Bible, in the book of Genesis, we see that God created the heavens and the earth, and He created man
Today there are some so-called Bible scholars who say that the tree of life is too ancient and has ceased to exist
It is not a huge cedar but a vine that continues to spread out, and it is for man's supply, not something to be used as material
At the end of Revelation 22, it says, 'Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life'
It is evident that the tree of life has not passed away but continues to exist and will continue unto eternity
What the Bible tells us is that this Triune God has become our tree of life and that He is the source of the supply of life
In John 3, the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus, 'Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
That which is born of our parents is of the flesh, just as the Lord said that that which is born of the flesh is flesh
The demonic gods that the backward nations worship are rough and wild; the idols that the civilized nations worship are rather refined
Whether the god which man worships is true or false, refined or barbaric, the fact that man worships God proves that man has a spirit
If you do not have the second birth, then you are incomplete, not up to par; you have not reached the standard
He is such a life-giving Spirit waiting for you to repent, confess, and open up yourself to receive the Lord Jesus to be your Savior
In the sixty-six books of the Bible, there is one book, the Gospel of John, which focuses on the matter of life
In reality the emphasis of the Gospel of John is not on the outward things but on the matter of being born to live
In John 3, the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus that he must be born again and that he must be born of water and the Spirit
As a poisonous serpent, Satan bit us; hence, we received his poisonous element into us and became little poisonous serpents
On the one hand the Gospel of John tells us that as the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus took away the sin of the world this is to deal with sin
On the other hand, it tells us that He was hung on the cross as the bronze serpent; this is to deal with the serpentine nature within us
The Lord Jesus said, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
Because this phrase who gives life has a twofold meaning in Greek, a better rendering is: 'who causes man to live and gives life to man'
He not only gives life to man but also causes man to live; He not only causes man to live but also gives life to man
Praise the Lord, today we who are saved have the Lord Jesus as the Spirit within and the Bible as the words without!
The words without are not for teaching but for nourishment; likewise, the Spirit within is also for nourishment
Today we no longer live by our old life; instead, we live by another life, a regenerated life, a resurrected life
In this way we know that He is in us and we are in Him because He and we, we and He, have become one, and we live together
The Word is mentioned at the beginning of the Gospel of John In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God
At the end of the Gospel of John, this Jesus Christ is the Spirit as the breath breathed into us for us to receive
Today He is living in the heavens at the right hand of the throne of God, but this is not the point of emphasis
Today if we open to Him from our innermost being to receive Him, He will come into us, and we will receive life and be regenerated
After this, He will be in us as our food to supply us that we may live and have life abundantly for us to live by Him
You must realize that formerly you had only your life, but now it is no longer you but the Lord Jesus who is living within you
Our religious concept is that man should do good to please God and to glorify God that he may worship God in peace
The central revelation in the Bible tells us that the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-has a move, a work, in two great steps
The first step of His work was to accomplish redemption for us that He might rescue us, the fallen men, and solve the problem of our sins
He does not impart His life to us without coming into us Himself; rather, He works Himself into us to be our life
We must realize that even if our life were clean, sinless, and perfect, God still needs to and wants to come into us to be our life
Whenever we do anything of darkness, we try to hide ourselves, and whenever we do anything of light, we feel free to make a display
The glove by itself is empty; when you put your hand into the glove, the glove has its content, its inner reality
Now our love has reality, and our light has content; we are truly sanctified, and our conduct is fair, just, righteous, and upright
In the whole universe, God's plan, God's desire, God's eternal purpose, God's divine goal, is to work Himself into us
Today, in their reading of the Bible for the study of the truths, many Christians stop at this step-God's redemption
We do not need to pay any price or do any work; to be saved we only need to repent and open ourselves to receive the salvation of the cross
The goal of God is that after He has redeemed and cleansed us, He enters into us to be our life and become our nature and everything
In the context of 1 Corinthians 15:45 we see that Paul used an illustration when he referred to the matter of resurrection
He said that when a grain of wheat is sown into the earth, although apparently it dies, in actuality the life within does not die
The last Adam, the incarnated Jesus, lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, and then He died on the cross and was buried
It is a pity that today's Christianity neither sees this matter nor pays attention to the second half of 1 Corinthians 15:45
John said, 'Every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit which does not confess
If you say that the Lord Jesus is not a creature, you do not confess that the Lord Jesus has come in the flesh
The Lord Jesus became a man, a creature; this does not mean that in becoming a creature He ceased to be the Creator
As such a man, He was the Lamb of God who could shed pure and genuine human blood for the redemption of the human race
He took a second step, that is, He died and was resurrected, and in His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit
In the first step, as God, He became a man-the last Adam; in the second step, the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
Verse 17a says that 'the Lord is the Spirit,' whereas 17b says that 'where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom'
The Bible shows us that the Lord Jesus, who was God, took two big steps for the accomplishment of God's purpose
Today the Lord Jesus in whom we believe is not only the One who became flesh but also the One who died and resurrected
Today there are some who say that the Lord is in heaven and not in us and that He is so great and man is too small to contain Him
They say that the Lord is not in us, but rather that He has a representative, the Holy Spirit, who is representing Him within us
We must not consider the Lord Jesus with our small brain; we must consider Him only according to what the Bible says
On the one hand, Romans 8:34 clearly says that today the Lord Jesus is in heaven sitting at the right hand of God
John 7:38-39 says that out of the innermost being of those who believe into Him will flow rivers of living water
In other words, at the time He was resurrected from the dead and was thus glorified , He then was the life-giving Spirit
When we believed into Him, God forgave us of our sins, and this life-giving Spirit entered into our spirit to regenerate our spirit
Obviously this is not an allegory but a factual statement, proving that today our Lord dwells in the spirit of those who have been saved
If the Lord Jesus were not the Spirit and if we did not have a human spirit within, how then could we be one spirit with the Lord?
Strictly speaking, we cannot find a verse in the New Testament that tells us to walk according to the Holy Spirit
It is basic for us Christians, the children of God, to walk according to this spirit, that is, the two spirits becoming one spirit
Dear brothers and sisters, we all must live according to this spirit, the spirit that is two spirits becoming one spirit
The result of our living with the Lord is that we live out Christ, and thus Christ is always magnified in our body
It is not a matter of outward right or wrong; rather, it is a matter of our living Him in the spirit, in the one mingled spirit
Although we do not pay much attention to so-called ethics, when we walk according to the spirit, our ethics will be the highest
These two spirits becoming one spirit is the greatest mystery in the universe; it is something incomprehensible to the human mind
Formerly He had been a carpenter at home, but when He became thirty years of age He came out to speak for God to do the work of preaching
After doing this work for nearly three and a half years, one day He told the disciples that He would be leaving them
What He meant by His going was that He was going to the cross to die and that after His death He would be resurrected
If someone today were to say that he is our food and that we must eat him, we would find this word hard to accept
We would definitely say that this man is crazy, that he is sick in his mind, and that he ought to be sent to the mental hospital
At the end of John 6, many of the disciples, after hearing this word, said, 'This word is hard; who can hear it'?
In John 14, the Lord told the disciples that He was going, but He also said that after going He would come again
Almost everybody in Christianity is in darkness with respect to this matter of God being man's life; there is no one who speaks about this
If He had not been incarnated, being without blood and flesh, He could not die for us and even more He could not shed His blood for us
Praise the Lord, He had flesh and blood so that He could die for us and shed real human blood to redeem us from sin!
At the time He was raised from the dead, He was like a grain that had died in the earth and grown up in a different shape
Corinthians 15, which is a chapter on resurrection, speaks of a grain being sown into the ground and growing into another shape
It speaks of the last Adam as such a grain resurrecting from the dead to become a 'tender sprout,' which is the life-giving Spirit
The Lord said, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone, but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
If you see this light, you will then realize that the theology taught in Christianity concerning the Trinity is very shallow
If you see the light in 1 Corinthians 15, you will realize that Christ and the Spirit are related and that They are two yet one
Whether the Lord could spread in them, whether He could abide and expand in them, depended on whether they were willing to abide in the Lord
What the Bible tells us is not only walking with, being with, dwelling with, or living with, but even more it is mutually abiding in
Ephesians 5 says that we must be filled in spirit , and not just filled but even overflowing with all the fullness of God
In reality it is the fullness of God that has filled us and has saturated our entire being so that we overflow God
They do not know the truth, nor do they know the reality of the Spirit; they teach people as religion the husks and feathers of the Bible
We thank and praise the Lord that here today we all are willing and we have received Him; thus, we have been saved
After reading the entire context, you will see that today our God, our Savior Christ, is the consummated Spirit
If the Lord Jesus did not go through death and resurrection, then there would not be the 'story' of the life-giving Spirit
If God did not become flesh, there would not be the story of the last Adam; there would only be the story of God
After the conception was completed, He with the human nature was born to be a God-man, possessing both divinity and humanity
The Lord lived and worked on earth for thirty-three and a half years, and eventually He died on the cross to accomplish redemption
If the vessel is dirty, you must first wash and even sterilize it; otherwise, the contents placed in the vessel would be contaminated
Even though God is Spirit, without going through incarnation, death, and resurrection He would have no way of dispensing life into us
He advanced from being the Spirit of God to being the Holy Spirit, and then from being the Holy Spirit to being the life-giving Spirit
Rather, it means that we have gone through creation and redemption and are now in the new creation, which is the church
Because He has gone through incarnation, death, and resurrection, He is now in us as the One who has been processed
In Genesis 1, He had not gone through the process, but today in the Epistles in the New Testament, He is a processed God
In this Spirit, there are the element of man, the element of God, and the elements of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection
In this abiding, He as the indwelling, all-inclusive Spirit solves all our problems, eliminates our preferences, and kills our lusts
In Him is God; in Him is our Savior; in Him is the killing effect of the cross; and, even more, in Him is the power of resurrection
If you put your hands in the solution and allow them to abide there for five minutes, your hands will be clean
Having been saturated with the power of resurrection, you will have the ability to humble yourself and apologize to others instead
In the previous three chapters we saw the matter of our living with the Lord and our mutual abiding with the Lord
The phrase develop the bright virtue seems very profound in wording, but actually there is nothing mysterious in it
Although this wonderful person in the Bible has passed through two thousand years of human research, He remains mysterious and unfathomable
Not only is His person wonderful, but His deeds, His might, and His transcendence are also difficult for us to comprehend
Napoleon occupied a dominant position for a period in history, but eventually he was banished to an island for imprisonment
Some say that to see the Son is to see the Father because the Son represents the Father, but this does not prove that the Son is the Father
In his Gospel John clearly stated at the outset that the Word was God and this God was the complete Godthe Father the Son and the Spirit
The blood of goats and calves cannot accomplish redemption for man's sins because it is only a type and a shadow
In the evening of the day of His resurrection, He showed His body to the doubting disciples because they thought He was an apparition
The Lord Jesus told them that He had bones and that they could put their finger into His side to touch the wounds
In China, not many believe in the Lord Jesus solely because of sins, but a great number believe because of sufferings
The new believers of the Lord Jesus usually have the thought of Jesus having great mercy and compassion, though they may not say it
According to the human concept, we always think that we need a Savior because we are so wicked, sinful, and full of sufferings
Some may understand that our living by Him means that we have to live outwardly in a manner which is proper good bright holy and overcoming
Confucius spoke of developing the 'bright virtue,' which is to develop and magnify the bright virtue that we had originally
In the universe, there is such a One who lived on the earth two thousand years ago for thirty-three and a half years
In Genesis 18, when Abraham was cooling himself at the tent door, three men came, two of whom were angels and the third was Jehovah God
In reality, He came to visit Abraham in the likeness of a man four thousand years ago, even before He became flesh
The Southern Baptists published an article about their faith, quoting many Scripture verses as the basis of their faith
Some may question, 'How could He have the form of a man at that time, and not only so, even have the reality of a man'?
He was buried and was resurrected on the third day, and at the time He was resurrected, He became the life-giving Spirit
On the evening of the day of His resurrection He came into the midst of His disciples as a spirit, yet with bones and flesh
On the one hand, the Bible tells us that the Lord Jesus was God who became a man as our Savior to bear our sins on the cross
On the other hand the Bible tells us that He died and resurrected and in His resurrection He became the lifegiving Spirit to enter into us
He was resurrected from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit to dwell in us and be mingled with our regenerated spirit
Whenever you walk according to the spirit, the Spirit comes out and the Lord Jesus is lived out because He is in your spirit
These teachings are not the center but the periphery of the Bible; they are the 'branches' and not the 'roots and trunk' of the Bible
Zechariah 12:1 says, 'Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him'
We can see that whether people are civilized or barbarian, Chinese or from abroad, all have something within them
You may call it the conscience, the innate knowledge and ability, or the bright virtue, but within you there truly is such a thing
When you do this, you are outside of your spirit; you are in the improper functioning of your lusts, emotions, and mind
On the other hand, while you are doing this, you sense an inner voice condemning you, even forbidding and criticizing you
Later, Wang Yang-ming studied it further and called it the innate knowledge of good and the innate ability to do good
If we add together the conscience, the knowledge of good, and the ability to do good, they equal the bright virtue
When he preached the gospel, his messages were not up to the standard of the truth, but he had the power to touch people
Sometimes while he was speaking, he would pull out a small wine bottle and act out a person getting drunk and beating his wife
When she returned home and thought things over, the Holy Spirit worked in her and said to her, 'How can you hate them?
It was not the speaking of doctrines that convinced her reasoning and persuaded her to admit that she should not be a concubine
The Bible does not merely speak of the function of our conscience, which causes us to repent and confess our sins
Before He could enter us He first had to be incarnated as a man go to the cross to die for us and shed His blood to redeem us from our sins
After He accomplished His redemptive work, that is, after His death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection
Timothy 1:7 says, 'God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness'
Within our created spirit we also have the Spirit of God, who is our Redeemer and who became the life-giving Spirit
Your being saved is not just a matter of your sins being forgiven, your being cleansed by the blood, or your being redeemed and regenerated
More than that, the Lord as the Spirit has entered your regenerated spirit and mingled with your regenerated spirit to become one spirit
They love the Lord, and they read the Bible and pray, but their experience of the Lord remains the same as it was forty or fifty years ago
One layer is the soul getting angry and the other layer is the hand which is a part of the body hitting someone in cooperation with the soul
Since the Lord is mingled with our spirit, and the two spirits have become one spirit, how do we need to exercise?
When you speak in the meetings, even more you must be according to the spirit; you must exercise your spirit and speak from your spirit
As long as you open your mouth in the meeting to testify, pray, or pray-read the Bible, you will be able to gain the enjoyment
If you do not open your mouth, you will have nothing, but as soon as you open your mouth, you will be supplied inwardly
When we come to the meetings, we are coming to worship, praise, enjoy, glorify, and exalt the Lord, so we cannot simply sit quietly
According to the revelation of the Bible, we all are priests; we were bought by the Lord with His blood to be priests
It does not matter if a person is young or old; as long as he has been saved and regenerated, he is a priest of God
When you want to go shopping, you must learn not to make a hasty decision but wait for half a minute to return to your spirit
When you turn to your spirit in this way you are exercising your spirit initiating from your spirit and living and walking from your spirit
By doing this, you will find that your whole experience is totally different, as different as heaven is from earth
If we truly live in spirit, our living will be heavenly; but if we live in ourselves, our living will be earthly
The Bible tells us that it is through His Word and His Spirit that God is able to work Himself into us to be our life and our life supply
The word of God is not abstract at all; it has been written out and solidly put into our hands, and we can read it every day
We should fix our mind on the words of the Bible, digest the words of the Bible, and masticate the words of the Bible
If God gave us merely His Word, we could understand only His intention and at the most know His revelation, but He could not enter into us
When we believe in Him, confess our sins, and receive Him as our Savior, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into us
When someone dies, we do not like to say that he died, but we say that he expired, that is, he breathed his last breath
Another example is that when a car tire does not have sufficient air, it needs to be taken to the gas station and pumped up
It tells us that this Christ who is the Word became flesh lived on the earth for thirtythree and a half years and eventually was crucified
Through His death Christ accomplished redemption signified by the blood and He flowed out the Spirit as living water to supply man with life
Is the Word and then the Spirit, and in the middle of the book there is John 6:63, which says, 'It is the Spirit who gives life;
In the beginning of the Gospel of John is the Word, at the end is the Spirit, and in between are the word and the spirit
If there were only the Word, there would be only the expression of intention; if there were no Spirit, the Lord could not come into us
Many Christians admit that the words of the Lord are the Spirit, but they have a hard time believing that the Spirit is the word
Ephesians 6:17 says, 'And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God'
Corinthians 15:45b says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,' and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
These three verses, John 6:63, Ephesians 6:17, and 2 Corinthians 3:17, show us that the Lord, the Word, and the Spirit are all one
Hu Shih read the Bible in the way of research, so he could see the Bible only as a literary work of high quality
If the word of God were not the Spirit, it could not be the sword but merely words, doctrines, or black letters on white paper
You can pray-read not only in one way but in many ways: by yourself, with your spouse, with a group, and in the meetings
Paul said that we should receive the sword of the Spirit, the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition
The words of the Bible are the breathing out of God, but when you turn them into prayer, they become your breathing in
In Matthew 4 the Lord Jesus said, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
In Matthew 4 the Lord Jesus dealt with the three temptations of the devil by quoting the words of the Scriptures
From the first verse to the last verse of the sixty-six books of the Bible, every word is a word that proceeds out of the mouth of God
It is not enough for us just to read and to understand what God breathed out because then it would be mere knowledge revelation and doctrine
It is necessary not only for the food to be prepared in the kitchen and set on the table; it is also necessary that you come to eat it
The best thing to do is to have a daily reading of some portions from the Old Testament and some from the New Testament in sequence
Begin with the first chapter of Genesis in the Old Testament and with the first chapter of Matthew in the New Testament
You may not feel that you have sinned, but you are still defiled because you are still in the old creation, in the flesh, and in the self
Even though we have not sinned, and even though we have not done anything wrong or thought anything wrong, we are still the flesh
The types in the Old Testament show us that whenever anyone went before God, he had to offer the sin offering and the trespass offering
When you come to the Lord, you need to take Him as your sin offering and trespass offering, asking Him to cleanse you with His blood
When your spirit is made alive, you must learn not to speak according to your thought and your mind but according to your spirit
The more you use your spirit, the sharper your mind will be and the clearer and wiser your thoughts will become
Paul said, 'All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness'
Rather, we pray by means of the Word of God and the Spirit of God to take in God Himself, who is in His words and in His Spirit
In this way, His words in us not only become a supply to us, but they also convict and teach us from deep within
Prayer: Lord, thank You for the constant cleansing of Your precious blood that we may receive mercy from You again to enter into Your word
We pray that You will give us the word of grace that we may be nourished, supplied, enlightened, strengthened, and comforted within
Because the human heart is too wild, like a horse running wild that easily causes problems, mankind needs religion to restrict the heart
The heavens, the earth, and all things did not come out of themselves but were created by God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth
He grew up in a poor family in Nazareth of Galilee, and He passed through thirty years of human living in that poor family
Since He was God, He possessed eternal life, against which death cannot prevail; thus, it was not possible for Him to be held by death
Since this Redeemer, this Savior, is in our spirit to be our life, we should contact Him and enjoy Him to receive His supply
The Bible says that this Savior of ours is food to us; as the bread that we can feed on, He can be received into us for our supply
Sometimes, not understanding what we speak, some may say, 'You are belittling the Lord Jesus by such a teaching
One day when the Lord Jesus was proclaiming God on the earth to carry out God's salvation, a Canaanite woman came to seek help from Him
Some people, not having seen this light in the Bible have criticized, saying, 'You liken the Lord Jesus to a small piece of bread
The Bible says that He is the tree of life to be food for man to eat; it says that He is also the living water to be water for man to drink
The Lord Jesus came into the midst of His disciples on the night of His resurrection and breathed into them saying Receive the Holy Spirit
All these are figures of speech, using physical and visible things to describe the spiritual and invisible reality
The Lord Jesus is our spiritual life, food, drink, and air; we cannot be separated from Him even for one moment
Peter 2:2 says, 'As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation'
The word of the Lord is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path, bringing life along with it that we may receive a supply within
Open the Bible, and whether it is morning, noon, or evening, you can contact Him and enjoy Him through His Word in this way
O Lord, we worship You for giving us this environment that we could meet freely and come together before You to seek You
Also, give us the utterance that You could speak from within us into everyone, so that each one of us can be supplied
If there were no Bible among men on earth, if there were no word of the Lord, then the entire world would fall into darkness
570 when Catholicism was formally established and papal authority was set up, that the Bible was declared to be sealed
The excuse was that common people could not understand the Bible and, therefore, would easily make mistakes and suffer loss in their reading
From that time until around 1518 when Martin Luther was raised up by the Lord, there was a period of almost ten centuries
Those who study history all know that this period of time in history is called the Dark Ages, or the Middle Ages
, Jewish scholars living in Egypt began to translate the Old Testament from Hebrew into Greek; this was called the Septuagint
When the apostles continued writing the New Testament, they quoted the Old Testament from the Septuagint version
We must know that it is useless to merely take the black and white printed words of the Bible and study them with only our mind
Young people studying in school are being trained mainly in the functions of their mind: the understanding, memory, and use of their mind
We can all tell that listening to a lesson in the classroom is one thing, while listening to a message in the meeting is another thing
In the classroom, you might be touched at times to shed tears or to laugh, but these have nothing to do with your spirit
In this way, you use your spirit, soul, and body, and you will not merely be touching the Bible without contacting the Lord
If you do not use your spirit to pray, then you may remain in a situation where you only touch the Bible without contacting the Lord
When you open the Bible to read, you will be able to inwardly understand what you are reading, and you will desire the Word
When you turn the Lord's Word into your prayer, the Spirit comes, and at the same time you are seeking the Lord
Hu Shih also read and studied the Bible, but he studied only with his mind and never touched the Spirit; therefore, he did not receive life
Once we understand, we spontaneously have a desire, and then at this time we turn what we have read and desired into a prayer
At the time the Lord Jesus was on earth, the Jewish teachers and leaders were zealous to search the Scriptures
They did not merely read, but they searched and studied because they thought that in the Scriptures they had eternal life
The reason the Scriptures have eternal life is because the contents of the Scriptures speak about Me, the Lord Jesus
When you read the Bible without exercising your spirit, it is the same as searching the Scriptures without coming to the Lord
You must read the Bible with your body, understand and long for it with your soul, and pray over it with your spirit
Because the Lord as the Spirit abides in our spirit, whenever we pray, we exercise our spirit and are able to contact the Lord
If we only get the doctrines or touch the Bible without contacting the Lord, then we have no way to obtain eternal life
We must combine our reading of the Bible with our praying, so that our reading is our praying and our praying is our reading
In this way, not only the words of the Lord will enter into us, but He also will enter into us in and with His words
As a result, not only will we obtain the Lord's words, but the Lord will be one with His words and enter into us as our supply
When the words are merely words, they are only black letters printed on the white paper; they are not the Spirit
When the words get into your mind through your eyes and you begin to pray with your spirit, then the words become the Spirit
These passages show us that the Bible is not merely a book for us to receive religious teachings and obtain knowledge about God
We all know that if we ate sand and got it into our stomach, this sand cannot supply us as food does, and it will even harm our body
Because God is abstract and mysterious, we must have the substantial Bible, the word of God, as the means for us to obtain the supply of God
On the one hand, we should not consider the Bible to be mere teachings, but on the other hand, we still need to be taught
If you read and eat the Lord's word every day, then His word will shine brightly within you and prevent you from stumbling
The word opening here does not mean the opening up of a truth through an explanation, but it refers to an actual digestion
Their exhortation, however, does not have much effect because the Lord's word has not been digested within you
You see that not only have you lost your temper with your wife, but your attitude toward others is also inappropriate
It is not necessary that you specifically pray-read the verses about loving your wife or submitting to your husband
Similarly, we should spend at least ten minutes every day, and it is best if we spend half an hour, to read the Lord's Word
We must first ask Him to cleanse us with His blood and then we exercise our spirit to pray over what we have read and understood in His Word
