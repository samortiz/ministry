   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRAVELING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God wants us to be persons in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The soul's use is as an organ; it is not to be our person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many, many times in the course of the day, however, we travel back and forth from spirit to soul and from soul to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our soul needs to be exhorted, "Soul, formerly you were my person, but now you are simply an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I do not regard you as my person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My real person is the inner man, my spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit with the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ask the Lord to help you practice.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Lord, thank You that I have a new person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am not that old man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My regenerated spirit, indwelt by You, is my new person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Help me to walk, live, act, and speak in the spirit, no longer in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I want to live by the inner man."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of prayer may be new to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is far more common to pray for the Lord to help us submit to our husband or to love our wife, that we might obey His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But praying in an ethical way like this results in even less submission and love than before.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rejoice in this new Person within you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He submits to the headship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Him is the love for your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Person is the very Lord Himself mingling with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What we have said thus far is a preparation for us to understand Ephesians 3:16: "That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For many years I have been considering this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"STRENGTHENED"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the apostle prayed that God the Father would grant us to be strengthened, he was praying for our precise need.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our need is to be made strong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"ACCORDING TO THE RICHES OF HIS GLORY"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This phrase, though we can easily read the words, is hard to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are to be strengthened according to a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That standard is the extent of the riches of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The strengthening is not only according to the degree of God's glory, but even to the riches of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What do these profound words mean?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Glory is God manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we pray that we may be strengthened into our inner man, the result will be that we are full of God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When God is expressed, there is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The riches of His glory are the divine virtues; namely, love, life, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These riches of God's expression will be seen in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Others will sense the glory of God upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the meaning of God's strengthening us according to the riches of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"WITH POWER"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Greek word for power here is related to the English words dynamo and dynamic.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The power referred to is like a generator; it means a tremendous force.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the very power that sufficed to raise Christ from the dead, uplift Him to the third heaven, and seat Him there far above all Eph 1:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is with this same power that God the Father would strengthen us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What a mighty power there is within our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"THROUGH HIS SPIRIT"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is through the Spirit of God that we are strengthened with power.</S>
