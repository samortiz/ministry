   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FULFILLING OUR STEWARDSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO DISPENSE THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>INTO PEOPLE BY PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The stewardship of the apostle is to dispense, to minister, the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel to the nations Eph 3:2, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some may think that only the apostle Paul has received this stewardship because he was the top apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many believers also maintain that there have only been twelve apostles throughout church history.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This concept is based upon the erroneous teaching of some of the Brethren teachers which stated that the twelve disciples selected by the Lord Jesus were the only apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to this teaching, Paul replaced Judas as the twelfth apostle, instead of Matthias.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They say that Matthias was excluded because he was selected by lots and not by Christ directly as Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This teaching, however, is not according to the entire revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts 1:26 says that after the lot fell upon Matthias, "he was numbered with the eleven apostles."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the next chapter, the Holy Spirit inspired the writer of Acts to say, "Peter, standing together with the eleven" 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that Matthias, who was chosen in 1:26, was recognized as one among the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, there are other apostles in addition to the first twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Barnabas was an apostle Acts 14:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Silas and Timothy also became apostles 1 Thes 1:1; 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Revelation 2 the church in Ephesus was commended by the Lord because they discerned the genuine apostles from the false apostles v. 2 . This implies that there were more apostles than the twelve apostles; otherwise, it would have been easy to identify the false apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Apostle is an anglicized Greek word which means one who is sent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every proper believer is a sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are examples of sent ones in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Isaiah was such a sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When he saw the glory of Christ John 12:38, 41 and heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Who will go for us?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Isaiah said, "Here am I; send me" Isa 6:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whoever is sent by the Lord is an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A little sister who is willing to be sent by the Lord to preach the gospel to her parents is an apostle, a sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Lord's new way, we have been instructed, encouraged, and charged to go out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Going out to preach the gospel equals being sent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As you go out to preach the gospel, you must have the realization that you are being sent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should be able to declare to the Lord, "My going out is Your sending."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because everyone who goes out to preach the gospel is a sent one, the number of apostles is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be sent out by the Lord is the intrinsic significance of the word apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Each day, if we would answer the Lord's call by saying, "Here am I, send me," we would be the Lord's sent ones, His apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The stewardship mentioned in Ephesians 3:2 was given not only to Paul but also to all of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul was a person fully consecrated to Christ, only caring for Christ day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The saints who have full-time jobs are a little different from Paul in that they must be occupied in making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In addition to this, there are various other affairs they have to take care of in regard to their families; otherwise, they could not survive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But even with such responsibilities, at least three hours could be spared during the week for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may tell the Lord, "Lord, I cannot be Your apostle with all of my time because I must earn a living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But I want to give You three hours a week.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>During these three hours, I would visit sinners with the gospel, feed the new believers, or perfect the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you would do this, you would be an apostle of Christ during those three hours.</S>
