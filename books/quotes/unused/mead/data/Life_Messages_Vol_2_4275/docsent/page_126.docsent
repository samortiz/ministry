   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Word exhorts us to walk according to spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible firstly serves to develop our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we read its pages, especially as we pray-read it in spirit, our spirit is nourished and developed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Secondly, the Bible corrects and preserves us lest we veer from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the spirit is abstract, we may misinterpret our inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, we need the Bible as a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose, for example, we have the feeling that we should beat our wife.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since such a feeling is contrary to what the Bible says, we can be sure that the feeling we have is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some brothers may be praying about wearing their hair long, to give another example.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their sense may be that it is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians 11:14, however, says that man should not have long hair.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the Bible preserving us from being led off from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our living and our activities must not be according to the dead letter of the Bible, however, but according to the living spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>CONSTANT EXERCISE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To remain in spirit, you must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you neglect to pray constantly, you will find yourself out of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By constant exercise you will become a person in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the last book of the Bible, John said he "was in spirit on the Lord's day" Rev 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You must also be one who is in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not desire the praise of others for your good living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Most people who seem good to us are in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not aspire to be a good person in your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You need to be in spirit when you speak, when you express your attitudes, when you love others, and even when you hate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All your daily living should be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then when you go to the meetings, you will be full of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may pray, or testify, or read a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever you do, the spirit will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not think that shouting releases your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are not daily exercising the spirit in your living, there can be no content of the spirit in your shouting; you are only making noise.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are saturated with the spirit, however, then when you open your mouth, your words will have the weight of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may shout spontaneously, but you should not shout purposely.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may say, "Lord, I praise and worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you are filled in spirit because your daily living has been in spirit, your words will release life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If not, your words will sound empty; they will lack the anointing and the riches of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If your shouting has an empty ring to it, you need to practice the proper exercise of the spirit during the whole day, not living by your soul or your flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you practice what I have suggested, you will experience the Lord's leading, presence, and anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He will permeate and saturate you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then when you preach the gospel, the spirit will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you fellowship with others, when you visit them in their homes, and when you are in the meetings, the spirit will come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The result of the Lord's changing us from men of flesh into men of gold is a lampstand in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The seven Spirits have a way paved for them to be released from the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The one lampstand with seven lamps can send forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is what the testimony of the lampstand should be in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church, the golden lampstand, expresses the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The key is to live according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Set your mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Watch unto this in all perseverance Eph 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Quench not the Spirit 1 Thes 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then you will be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The fullness of God dwells in Thee;</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thou dost manifest God's glory;</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As Spirit, oneness with me sought.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All things of the Father are Thine;</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All Thou art in Spirit is mine;</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Spirit makes Thee real to me,</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That Thou experienced might be.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Spirit of life causes Thee</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By Thy Word to transfer to me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received,</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thy life in me is thus conceived.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In spirit while gazing on Thee,</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a glass reflecting Thy glory,</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Like to Thyself transformed I'll be,</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>That Thou might be expressed thru me.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thy Spirit will me saturate,</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every part will God permeate,</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Deliv'ring me from the old man,</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>With all saints building for His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hymns, #501</S>
