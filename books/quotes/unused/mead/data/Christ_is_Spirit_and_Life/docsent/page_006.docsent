   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO RECEIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS SPIRIT AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Just as our human life is sustained by eating food and drinking water, so the divine life is received by the way of eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this purpose God has created for man a receiving organ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The organ for us to receive physical food is our stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The organ by which we can receive spiritual food and drink is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has created a spirit for man, which is designed particularly so that man can receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man's spirit is different from man's body, and it is also different from man's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a part that is deeper than man's soul and lies hidden within man's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible calls this part the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ as Spirit and life is real today, but He cannot be realized by means of our soul, that is, our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you try to understand Him with your mind or feel Him with your emotion, you will not be able to experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The proper organ to receive Christ is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our spirit is our spiritual digesting organ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With our spirit we can eat and drink Christ as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Two very important things related to life are eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without eating and drinking, man cannot survive physically.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every day we must eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The same is true with our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Bible there are the river of life and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The river of life is for our drinking, and the tree of life is for our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The river of life is a picture of Christ as the Spirit of life, and the tree of life is a picture of Christ as the supply of life to man in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has no intention for us to worship Him in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His intention is that we would take in Christ as food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By enjoying our God as food and drink, Christ as the Spirit and life comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The best way to eat and drink of Christ is to pray by calling on His name and to read the Bible by praying with the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not a religious exercise or a legal duty, but a way to enjoy Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE RESULT OF RECEIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>AS SPIRIT AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the divine life comes into us, we are regenerated; we have God's life, and we become God's sons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be a Christian is not a matter of fulfilling certain religious obligations or reforming our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One does not become an American by reforming himself, but by being born with a life from American parents.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, we do not become sons of God by doing anything, but by receiving God's life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our human life, after we are born we continue to grow by eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the same way, by eating Christ as the spiritual food and drinking the Spirit as the water of life, our spiritual life will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Day by day as we eat and drink of Christ, we will grow in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way we will be a people who are filled with God and will eventually express God in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the meaning of the Christian life.</S>
