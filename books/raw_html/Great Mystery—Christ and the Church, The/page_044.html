        <h2 class="head1">EATING TO CULTIVATE<br />
OUR SPIRITUAL APPETITE</h2>
<p><em>Question: Can we visit the saints who do not have a spiritual appetite and give them &ldquo;nutrition shots&rdquo; in order to boost their spiritual appetite? What should we do if we visit a home that has contracted a spiritual infectious disease, and we become infected?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This medical illustration is very appropriate, because medicine is closely related to our physical life. This principle can also apply to our spiritual life. If a patient does not have an appetite, he might be given an injection or fed intravenously in order to restore his appetite. This also applies to the spiritual realm. Sometimes saints are weak and do not come to the meetings; hence, we need to visit them in their homes. However, we need to bring a &ldquo;sterilizer&rdquo; with us. For example, some saints still enjoy playing mah-jongg. If we go to a saint&rsquo;s home while he is playing mah-jongg, and we are tempted to play with him, we have been &ldquo;infected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a person is accustomed to a certain kind of food, he will always prefer that food. People from northern China are accustomed to eating steamed buns; to them steamed buns are the most delicious food. They also like to eat dumplings. When I started the work in Taiwan, I established the workers&rsquo; home. Although a small number of the saints staying there were from northern China, the majority were from the south. For nearly half a year dumplings were not included in the meals, and the brothers from the north murmured and complained. After this, the kitchen crew served dumplings frequently, but then the saints from the south began to complain. The dumplings were a delight to the northerners but a suffering to the southerners. This example shows that the northerners liked to eat dumplings because they were accustomed to eating them. In the same way, the more we eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word, the more we will enjoy eating it. Therefore, we must build up the habit of eating His Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING OVER THE WORDS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p><em>Question: When I am with the saints in the meetings, I am eager to pray, but I realize that I am short of words and utterance. Why is this so?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There are two reasons: there is a lack of prayer, and there is a lack of pray-reading. Therefore, you must learn to pray more. The best way to pray is to pray-read, that is, to pray over the words of the Bible. Then the words of the Bible will become the words in our prayers. It is not easy for us to come up with words to pray when we are by ourselves. It is also not easy to compose a prayer. The best way to pray is to use the words of the Bible, because the words of the Bible are exhaustless. We need much practice in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING PRAYER IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><em>Question: I feel that the messages and prayer should be separated; in other words, we should not use prayer to give a message. Is this view correct?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The Lord Himself should be the object of our prayer. It is not right to admonish people with our prayer. For example, if we feel that a certain brother is lazy and that his clothes are always dirty, we should fellowship with the brother. However, if we are afraid of offending him, we may use the time when everyone gathers for prayer to admonish him, praying, &ldquo;Lord, teach us to be diligent and clean. We do not want to be lazy and dirty.&rdquo; This is a criticizing prayer. There should not be such prayers in the church.</p>
<p>However, there may be a burden to release a particular truth through prayer, and we can find examples of this in the Bible. In Ephesians 3 Paul bowed his knees unto the Father and prayed that He would grant us, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith (vv. 14, 16-17). This type of prayer is acceptable in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING THE GOOD NATIONAL CHARACTER<br />
WITHOUT REPLACING CHRIST</h2>
<p><em>Question: Since national character can become a hindrance to the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on the earth, what are some points in the Japanese character that might become a hindrance?</em></p>
<p>Answer: National character is part of culture. A certain kind of culture produces a certain kind of national character. We cannot completely abandon culture; rather, we should use culture in a proper way for the sake of the Lord but not replace the Lord with culture. Every nation has its national character. Some national characteristics are good, but others are not. We must learn to apply the good national characteristics and to reject what is not good. The Japanese have a very good national character. They are conscientious, patient, and thorough. This fact is recognized throughout the whole world. Anything that is processed by the Japanese is a fine and delicate work.</p>
<p>When I was in the United States, I received the Life-study message outlines and the Recovery Version of the New Testament that were published by the Japanese Gospel Book Room. I showed them to the American brothers and said, &ldquo;The Japanese do a better job in printing and binding than the Americans. Their work is delicate and careful.&rdquo; The Japanese character is very meticulous. The Japanese character is also diligent and frugal. Such characteristics are helpful when we are conducting ourselves and handling things. We should learn to apply them, but they must not replace Christ.</p>
<p>Even more, the aspects of national character that are not good should not replace Christ. The national character in areas near the Equator tends to be loose. This has much to do with the weather. In South America and Southeast Asia the hot weather makes people dizzy, and they do not want to do anything. The local people need to shower in cold water many times a day. The coolest time in Brazil is the winter. When Brazilians are asked to do something, they often say, &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo; Everything, except for eating, is postponed to the next day. This national character is related to weather.</p>
<p>In contrast, the countries in North Asia have a colder climate. Japan, Korea, and northern China, for example, have a strict national character. This is related to the weather as well. Similarly, the countries in Europe that are at higher latitudes, such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, also have a stricter national character. However, the countries that are at lower latitudes, such as southern France, southern Italy, Spain, and Portugal, have a looser national character. A loose national character is undesirable.</p>
<p>If we preach the gospel to a Brazilian, he may say, &ldquo;Wait until tomorrow,&rdquo; or if we tell him to repent, he may reply, &ldquo;Okay, I will repent tomorrow.&rdquo; This is not a good national character. The countries that are at higher latitudes, such as England, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden, and Japan, have a strict national character. This is an indisputable fact. However, we must be cautious and not let good national character replace Christ. For example, the national character of the Jews has its strengths, but the Jews want their national strengths rather than Christ. This is wrong. We can use good national character and apply it to the things of the Lord. However, if we replace Christ with national character, we are repeating the mistake of the Jews.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
