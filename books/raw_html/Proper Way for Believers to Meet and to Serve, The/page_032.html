        <h2 class="head3">Choking and Killing<br />
the Spiritual Life of the Believers</h2>
<p>The practice of one person speaking and the rest listening not only annuls the life function of the believers; it also chokes and kills the believers&rsquo; spiritual life so that they do not sense the need for the growth in life. As a result, the meetings are for recreation and are the fulfillment of their duty. The believers simply flow with the tide. Some brothers regret serving as elders, because in every meeting they have to sit on the front row and take care of the meeting, which includes calling a hymn, praying, and speaking. Before they were elders, some of these brothers always sat at the back and never opened their mouth for three or five years. But once they were made elders, they immediately had to sit on the front row and function in every meeting. For this reason, I have said that the best way to make the brothers function is to appoint them as elders. As soon as they are appointed as elders, they function in the meetings. I have also observed that when some elders who were active in the meetings withdrew from the eldership, they stopped functioning. We no longer see them in the meetings or hear their voices. The moment a person ceases to be an elder, he is no longer active and stops functioning. This is wrong, and it shows that their spiritual life was choked and killed. This is the second drawback to our old practice.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Building Up a Social Group<br />
but Not the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The practice of one person speaking and the rest listening can build up only a social group, which is an organization. It cannot build up the Body of Christ, which is an organism. According to our practice of one person speaking in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting, the rest of the believers merely sit and listen, give money, and then go home. This way of meeting can maintain a social group and build up an organization, but it cannot build up the Body of Christ. An organism needs to eat, to drink, to rest, and to exercise. An organism also needs training to learn how to move according to its inward supply and outward expression. A wooden desk is an organization. It can be built by nailing a few pieces of wood together, and it can retain its original appearance even if it is put aside for thirty years. Our body, however, is organic and requires activities in order to be maintained and built up.</p>
<p>For example, I speak with my mouth, but my eyes, my eyebrows, and the rest of my body are also moving. When a person dies, his body is motionless; when he is alive, the body is always moving. If I were to lie down for a long time without moving, I would appear to be dead. But if I am speaking and jumping, you can be sure that I am alive; even my hair seems to be alive. This is the expression of an organism. Therefore, the church as an organism should not meet in a way that is similar to a social organization. The church should meet in the way of the members supplying one another out from the Head. In the church meetings there should be the mutual supply by everyone speaking to minister life. This is the manifestation of an organism and the practical building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL MATTERS TO BE RECOVERED<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY TODAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Recovering the Church Meetings in Mutuality<br />
as Revealed in the Bible</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today we should recover what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. These verses are the Lord&rsquo;s divine speaking and ordination, but they are not being practiced in Christianity. These two verses are in the Bible but not in Christianity; hence, they must be recovered.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Recovering the Organic Building Up<br />
of the Church</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; Then through the apostle in Ephesians 4:11 He said that He &ldquo;gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers.&rdquo; These are gifts who, instead of building up the church directly, perfect the saints to do the work of the ministry (v. 12). In the New Testament there is only one ministry, and this ministry carries out the work of the building up of the Body of Christ (v. 16). This one ministry is the work of the gifts. After the saints are perfected, their work is also this ministry, which is for the building up of an organism, the Body of Christ, not the building up of a social organization.</p>
<p>In verse 15 the apostle says, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; Meetings with one person speaking do not give the believers the sense that they should grow in life. But the main goal of the church meetings is to minister life in order for the saints to grow. This growing is the building up. The growth of a newborn child is his being built up. In order to grow, the child must eat, drink, and exercise. This growth, development, and edification is for the building up of his human body. Likewise, as members of the Body of Christ, we need to grow through the spiritual supply for our development. Such a need cannot be met by meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. Rather, meetings where everyone functions to supply one another for the manifestation of the functioning of every member of the Body will cause everyone to grow up into the Head, Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; <em>Out from whom</em> refers to the Head, Christ. <em>All the Body</em> includes you and me. The phrases <em>through every joint of the rich supply</em> and <em>through the operation in the measure of each one part</em> indicate that we all have to function so that we can be joined together and knit together. Joining is through the joints, and knitting is through the operation of each part. Both result in the gradual growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. The gifts do not build up the Body directly; rather, they perfect every member of the Body so that the members can carry out their function for the direct building up of the Body. This building is the growth. In order to grow, there is the need of a life supply. Without the life supply, the Body cannot grow, and without growth, the Body cannot be built up. This word in Ephesians 4:16 is very clear.</p>
<p>We must see that if we continue to meet according to our old way, we will not have the building up of the Body; instead, we will only have the sustaining of an organization. The harm caused by the old way includes annulling the organic function, choking and killing the spiritual life, abandoning the building up of the Body, and abolishing the reality of everyone functioning. When we speak of recovery, we mean the recovery of the organic building up of the church by restoring what has been annulled, choked and killed, abandoned, and abolished.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
