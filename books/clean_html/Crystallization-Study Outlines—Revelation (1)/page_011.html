<h1 class="title">Christ as Another Angel<br />
and the Finishing of the Mystery of God</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 7:2; 8:3-5; 10:1-6; 18:1; 10:7</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In His work in the divine administration, Christ is another Angel&mdash;7:2; 8:3; 10:1; 18:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is called &ldquo;another Angel&rdquo; because He stands on the position of one who has been sent by God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the Old Testament Christ was called the Angel of the Lord&mdash;Gen. 22:11-12; Exo. 3:2-6; Judg. 6:11-24; Zech. 1:11-12; 2:8-11; 3:1-7.</li>
		<li>In the book of Revelation He is called &ldquo;another Angel,&rdquo; the unique, special Angel, because He is the One sent by God to carry out His economy&mdash;7:2; 8:3; 10:1, 5, 9; 18:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As another Angel Christ takes care of God&rsquo;s people, both the sons of Israel and the believers:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In 7:2-8 He takes care of the chosen remnant of Israel and is unveiled as another Angel in relation to &ldquo;a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel&rdquo;&mdash;v. 4.</li>
		<li>In His work as another Angel, Christ takes care of the believers, the redeemed saints of the church, preserving them throughout all the tribulations&mdash;vv. 9-17.</li>
		<li>Christ as God&rsquo;s Angel controls the whole universe, directing the other angels to carry out God&rsquo;s judgment upon the earth&mdash;vv. 2-3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In 8:3-5 Christ as another Angel executes God&rsquo;s administration over the earth by ministering to God as the High Priest with the prayers of His saints:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The incense altar (golden altar) is the executing center of God&rsquo;s administration&mdash;v. 3.</li>
		<li>The golden censer signifies the prayers of the saints (5:8), and the incense signifies Christ with all His merit added to the saints&rsquo; prayers.</li>
		<li>When the prayers of the saints ascend to God with the incense of Christ, God carries out His administration&mdash;8:5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God&rsquo;s administration needs the saints&rsquo; prayers, which are their response to Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry.</li>
			<li>As we pray He administrates, and as He administrates we pray.</li>
			<li>Christ first offers our prayers to God and then pours out God&rsquo;s answers.</li>
			<li>The pouring out of God&rsquo;s answers to our prayers equals God&rsquo;s universal administration.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In 10:1-2 Christ comes as another Angel to take possession of the sea and the land:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>His having one foot on the sea and the other on the land signifies that He is coming to take possession of the whole earth&mdash;v. 2b.</li>
		<li>Although the earth and the sea have been usurped by God&rsquo;s enemy, one day Christ will no longer tolerate this usurpation, and He will come to claim His rightful inheritance&mdash;Psa. 2:8; 24:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In His work as another Angel Christ will come to declare God&rsquo;s judgment over Babylon the Great and to appear in glory to make the whole earth the kingdom of God&mdash;18:1-2; 11:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The seventh trumpet, as the conclusion of the eternal economy of the processed Triune God, closes the present age of mystery; hence, Revelation 10:7 says, &ldquo;The mystery of God is finished&rdquo;:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Daniel 9:24 speaks of the seventy weeks, which were apportioned to &ldquo;seal up vision and prophet&rdquo;:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To seal up vision and prophet is to close the age of mystery (the age of the church), that is, to finish the mystery of God.</li>
		<li>The vision and prophet will be sealed because everything will be fulfilled:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>There will be no further need of vision and prophet.</li>
			<li>In the kingdom age, there will be kings and priests but no prophets.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the dispensations from Adam to Moses and from Moses to Christ, everything was unveiled, manifested, and there was no mystery; also in the dispensation of the millennial kingdom everything will be unveiled, and there will be no more mystery.</li>
	<li>In the dispensation from Christ to the millennial kingdom&mdash;the church age, the age of grace&mdash; everything is a mystery:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The incarnation of Christ, as the beginning of the dispensation of mystery, is a mystery&mdash; 1 Tim. 3:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Through the incarnation of Christ, the infinite God was brought into the finite man.</li>
			<li>The entire God, not God the Son only, was incarnated; hence, Christ in incarnation is the entire God manifested in the flesh.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ is the mystery of God&mdash;Col. 2:2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God.</li>
			<li>As the mystery of God, Christ is the embodiment, definition, and explanation of God; all that God intends to do is related to Christ.</li>
			<li>In Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; that is, the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Christ in a bodily form&mdash;v. 9.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The church is the mystery of Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:4-6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ is a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ.</li>
			<li>This mystery is God&rsquo;s economy, which is to dispense Christ, as the embodiment of God, into God&rsquo;s chosen people in order to produce a Body to be the increase of God&rsquo;s embodiment in Christ, that God may have a corporate expression.</li>
			<li>Christ and the church as one spirit are the great mystery&mdash;5:32.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 13:11), the gospel (Eph. 6:19), the indwelling of Christ (Col. 1:27), and the resurrection and transfiguration of the saints as the ending of the dispensation of mystery are also mysteries.</li>
		<li>At the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet, all these mysteries will be completed; therefore, the mystery of God will be finished.</li>
		</ol></li>
