<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE SPIRIT IS PARTICULARLY CALLED<br>THE SPIRIT OF LIFE, THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST,<br>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS, THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST,<br>THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD, AND THE LORD SPIRIT</H2><P>The Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7b), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19b), the Spirit of the Lord (2 Cor. 3:17b), and the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18b) are new terms for the Spirit in the New Testament. The Lord Spirit is a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. He is the consummated Triune God.</P><P>The Triune God was processed to become the all-inclusive Spirit. The first step of the Triune God's process was incarnation. The second step was human living, and the third step was His death. The fourth step was His resurrection. After going through such a "tunnel" of His process, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The life-giving Spirit is the processed and consummated Triune God. This Spirit, the processed and consummated Spirit, is the consummation of the Triune God, who is both God and man, having both the divine nature and the human nature. Within Him there is the element of divinity. Within Him there is also the element of the sanctified and uplifted humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE SPIRIT IS A COMPOUND SPIRIT,<br>TYPIFIED BY THE COMPOUND ANOINTING OINTMENT</H2><P>The Spirit, after Christ's resurrection, is a compound Spirit, typified by the compound anointing ointment. Exodus 30:23-25 says, "Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, and of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive a hin: and thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be a holy anointing oil." The compound anointing ointment in these verses is a unique type of the all-inclusive Spirit.</P><P>The Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament, is full of types. The burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering are types (Lev. 1&#151;7). The tabernacle is also a great type (Exo. 25:8-9; 40:1-2). In Exodus 30 there is also the wonderful, mysterious type of the compound ointment. We need to be impressed with the significance of this type.</P><P>The one hin of olive oil is the base of the compound ointment, and this oil is compounded with four spices&#151;myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. These five elements compounded together become an ointment. An ointment may be compared to paint. Paint is not merely oil, but it is oil compounded with other elements. The ointment in Exodus 30 is a compound of five elements. God told Moses to compound these five elements together to make an "ointment compound."</P>
