   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After living on earth as a God-man for thirty-three and a half years, the Lord Jesus died on the cross as the fulfillment and reality of the type of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By His death on the cross He accomplished redemption and terminated all the negative things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The outcome of such a death was resurrection with the issue of the divine life, which is the reality of the consummated Triune God to be our portion.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He still needed a consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before His incarnation, He was merely God without a consummation.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All this has become a wonderful feast for God and for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The ultimate issue of the processed Triune God is Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By the time we come to the feast of Pentecost, all the negative things have been cleared away, and all the positive things have been released.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The processed Triune God as the consummated One has been poured upon us to bring us into Himself so that we may be His extension, enlargement, increase, and expansion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we are Christ's Body, and in this Body we have the mingling of the consummated, processed Triune God with the chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The entire universe is for this, and it will remain forever.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, it will become the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as the complete, eternal testimony of the consummated Triune God with His redeemed ones.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are enjoying the feast of Passover, and we are still in the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of the first-fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, we are still in the feast of Pentecost, which is actually a feast of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The second group of feasts points to the future, to the coming days, to the time of the Lord's coming back.</S>
