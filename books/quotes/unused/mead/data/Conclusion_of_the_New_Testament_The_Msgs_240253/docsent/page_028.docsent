   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ITS REALITY, ITS NATURE, ITS EXPRESSION,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ITS RELATION TO GOD S GLORY,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND ITS UNSHAKABLENESS 2</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the foregoing message we covered the kingdom of God in its reality and in its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message we shall consider the kingdom in its expression in the divine attributes and with human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We shall also see that the expression of the kingdom is in peacefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>ITS EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The expression of the kingdom involves three matters: the divine attributes, the human virtues, and our shining as the light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A. In the Divine Attributes</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s attributes refer to all that belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the things that belong to God become our experience, they become our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With God there are attributes, and with us there are virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, love is an attribute of God, not a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But when the love of God becomes our experience, it produces the virtue of love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, with respect to God we use the word attributes, but in relation to ourselves we use the word virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Divine Love</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First John 4:8 and 16 tell us that God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The divine love is the nature of God s essence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, it is an essential attribute of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Love as the nature of God s essence is the source of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Gospel of John love is manifested as grace 1:14, 16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Epistle of 1 John we have the divine love as the source of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Epistle of 1 John reveals that when we are in the fellowship of the divine life, that is, in the enjoyment of the processed Triune God, this enjoyment will have a certain outcome.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The outcome of the enjoyment of the processed Triune God is the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we enjoy the Triune God, this enjoyment issues in the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With this divine love we spontaneously love others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Divine Light</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Light is the nature of God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the divine light is an expressive attribute of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As love, the nature of God s essence, is the source of grace, so light, the nature of God s expression, is the source of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Gospel of John we have light manifested as truth in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1 John we have the divine light as the source of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Son we come to the Father and experience Him as the source of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First John 1:5 says, God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Light is God s expression; it is God shining.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we dwell in God, who is the shining One, we are in light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The very God in whom we dwell is light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 1:5 we are told that in God there is no darkness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As light is the nature of God in His expression, so darkness is the nature of Satan in his evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank God that He has delivered us out of the satanic darkness into the divine light Acts 26:18; 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The divine light is the divine life in the Son operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This light shines in the darkness within us, and the darkness cannot overcome it John 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we follow this light, we shall by no means walk in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Divine Holiness</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Holiness is one of the main attributes of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word holy not only means sanctified, separated, but also distinct, different, from everything that is common.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only God is distinct, different in His nature from all things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, He is holy; holiness is the distinct quality of His nature, as one of His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First Peter 1:15 and 16 say, According to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also become holy in all your manner of life; because it is written, You shall be holy, because I am holy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Holy One is the Triune God the choosing Father, the redeeming Son, and the sanctifying Spirit 1 Pet 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Father has regenerated His elect, imparting His holy nature into them 1 Pet 1:3 ; the Son has redeemed them with His blood from the vain manner of life 1 Pet 1:18-19 ; and the Spirit has sanctified them according to the Father s holy nature, separating them from everything that does not fit in with God s holy nature so that they, by the holy nature of the Father, may become holy in all manner of life, even as holy as God Himself is.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The way God makes us holy is to impart Himself, the Holy One, into us so that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For us to be holy, therefore, is to partake of God s nature 2 Pet 1:4 and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This makes our being holy, like God Himself is in His nature.</S>
