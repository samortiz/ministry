   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We need to be impressed deeply that the safeguard of our whole Christian walk and the balance of our Christian life is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we have seen the church, we will never be divided by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are clear concerning the vision of the church, we will never have hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For one to place bishops above elders indicates that he has not seen that the church is a living Body, an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church cannot be controlled by human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hierarchy is human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the church is the organic Body of Christ, it can have nothing to do with organization.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If something is wrong in our physical body, it is healed organically.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The body is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It cannot be touched or dealt with in an organizational way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is not only the Body of Christ but also the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Just as the life within our physical body takes care of sicknesses, the life within the Body of Christ can take care of any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there are some problems in a local church, it is best if we keep our hands off of these problems and leave them to Christ, the heavenly doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is the life in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to let the life in the Body work within the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our own doing apart from this life is organization, and this will not help the Body but damage the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we see problems in the church, we need to learn to hold back our being and our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every problem and trouble in the church is a temptation to the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the leading ones in the churches hold themselves back when there is a problem, that is a great victory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The biggest temptation to the leading ones in the churches is the troubles and problems in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They may feel that they have to do something to solve these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While we are doing something, however, we can be in the realm of organization, which damages the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to restrain our doing and let the life in the Body take care of the troubles and the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do this, it means that we know that the church is not an organization but the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a person cuts his finger, he may need to take care of it in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if he takes care of it improperly, he will do more damage to it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, the cut on his finger will be healed by the life within his body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church is not an organization but an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Church history has shown that organization has damaged the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all need to see what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we see the church as the corporate goal of God, whatever we do will be profitable to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the defenders of the truth in the past lacked the proper knowledge of the church, they made mistakes that damaged the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today in the Lord's recovery we need to see the church, to see the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then whatever we do will be a profit and will never be a loss or a damage to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The vision of the church is our safeguard and balance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as we stand with the church, we are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we stay away from the church, we are in danger of damaging the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we may see that opinions, organization, rank, and different teachings damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This damage takes place because people do not have an adequate vision of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today in the Lord's recovery, the Lord desires to show us the ultimate goal of His purpose the church life.</S>
