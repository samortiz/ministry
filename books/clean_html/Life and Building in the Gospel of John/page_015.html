<h2 class="head2">Darkness Being to Feel Nothing</h2>
<p><em>Darkness</em> in verse 5 does not refer to outward, visible darkness but to spiritual darkness. In a simple sense, spiritual darkness involves the absence of any spiritual feelings. The light that shines within a Christian causes an abundance of rich, keen, and fine feelings. Regrettably, some brothers and sisters can go for days, weeks, or even months without having any spiritual feelings. Even if we have a routine of rising early to pray and read the Bible, going to work during the day, and going to a meeting at night but have no rich, keen, or fine feelings, we are in spiritual darkness.</p>
<p>Other Christians, however, are full of spiritual feelings. As soon as they rise in the morning, they feel that they have been loose with their words and loose in their attitudes. When they pray and read the Bible, they feel that they have not been absolute in paying a price to follow the Lord. They feel that they have followed their own preferences related to finances and clothing. In addition, they feel that their intentions and motives are not simple and pure. These feelings prove that there is light shining within them. Furthermore, their words are able to shine into others when they fellowship with others.</p>
<p>It is possible for a saint to have no feelings or to be full of feelings. Those who have no feelings are in darkness, and it is easy to be affected by their darkness. When we listen to such ones, it almost feels like darkness is seizing and conquering us. The more they speak, the more darkness envelops and floods over us. With others, however, we sense the shining of light as soon as we contact them. Everything they speak conveys a sense of light, and their speaking even brings us into the light. The more they speak, the more their light shines forth upon us and even conquers us. Their speaking causes us to become shining.</p>
<p>Being in darkness causes us to feel nothing; it causes us to be numb, to be without a feeling of thirst or hunger, and to have no sense of need or conviction. In such darkness it is easy to feel good about oneself. In contrast to being in darkness, however, the light causes us to have many feelings. It fills us with a sense of thirst and hunger, and we have no ground for feeling good about what we are in ourselves. Instead, we feel that we are unacceptable, that our words are inaccurate, that our attitude is improper, that our thoughts are unholy, that our motives are impure, that our love is impure, and that we are full of mixture in spiritual matters. Such persons are in the light, and the light is shining within them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Darkness Being Related to Death</h2>
<p>Being in darkness not only involves the loss of spiritual feelings but also the stillness of death. Light produces vitality. Wherever there is light, there is vitality. Those who are inwardly living are full of light and those who have the stillness of death and dejection are in darkness. A brother may be quiet, but quietness is different from the stillness related to death. A Christian who is lacking in spiritual vitality is in darkness, and this darkness is related to the stillness of death.</p>
<p>A meeting that lacks vitality is a meeting in darkness. I once joined a bread-breaking meeting that was scheduled to start at 7:30 in the evening, yet as the time approached 7:30, no one rose up to select a hymn. Everyone was still and quiet. At 7:40 the stillness and quietness made me almost cry. There were many seated in the meeting hall, but they were all so still, and they did not look at each other. Everyone sat in complete silence. This is what I call the stillness of death. Such deathly stillness is related to darkness. If we have light, we will weep when we encounter such situations, and we will not allow the meeting to be still for even a few minutes. We do not have to follow a set practice of selecting a hymn; instead, we can pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us so that we may be made alive. People in death cannot praise You. Lord, do enliven us.&rdquo; Such a prayer can enliven us with the shining of light. Light produces feelings related to life and vitality. Darkness can also hinder us from preaching the gospel in a living way or from fellowshipping freely with a brother or sister. If we have the shining of light, we will be full of inward feelings and vitality. Then in our meetings, in our preaching of the gospel, and in our fellowship with others, we will be full of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DARKNESS NOT OVERCOMING THE LIGHT</h2>
<p>Third, darkness does not overcome the light. In one sense light is very strong; it is capable of driving away darkness. However, in another sense light is very weak; it can easily be blocked by anyone who does not receive it. Hence, whether or not the light shines on us depends on whether or not we receive the light. The morning sunlight is able to break through the darkness, but one can either receive it or reject it. For example, after we rise up in the morning to pray and read the Word of God, we often receive an inner sense from the Lord. If we ignore this feeling, we will not receive the light that overcomes darkness. Likewise, when we fellowship with a brother during the day and the light in his words shines into us, we should receive it rather than closing ourselves to his speaking. When we close ourselves, we reject the light and remain in darkness. We can also reject the light that comes to us in a meeting. The speaking in the meeting may stir up a certain feeling within us. When we begin to consider the cost of responding to and receiving this speaking, however, it is easy to reject the light. Such rejection causes us to remain in darkness.</p>
<p>Genuine Christians should be in the shining of light every day. God is light, and He is shining in us. Thus, we should be full of feelings. However, we often reject this light; that is, we ignore our inner sense of life. When we reject the light, we are in darkness. Our original condition is one of darkness, and the more we preserve this condition by rejecting the shining of the light, the more we become numb and dead. The light shines in the darkness; it shines in our dark being. Whenever the light shines in us and we receive even a little of its shining, the light overcomes the darkness and changes our situation by enlivening us.</p>
<p>Many of us pray and read the Bible every day. While it is difficult to feel nothing when we pray and read the Bible, I am afraid that we reject many of the feelings that we receive. When the light shines in the darkness, we must receive it so that the light can overcome our darkness. If we respond to the shining of the light every day, we will be full of light, and everyone who touches us will feel bright and shining as well.</p>
<p>The light is very strong; it is capable of driving all darkness away. However, it is also very gentle; it can be easily rejected. There is no difference in the light that we receive and the light that we reject; it is the same light. However, there is a difference to us if we do not receive the light. We can be either bright, living, and full of feelings when we receive the light, or we can be dark and dead when we reject the light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DARKNESS NOT SEIZING THE LIGHT</h2>
<p>Fourth, the darkness cannot seize the light. However, we must seize the light. When God&rsquo;s light shines within us, it often does so little by little. There is a flash here and a manifestation there. We need to learn to be in fear and trembling lest we neglect the light. Once the light shines and we have a feeling from the Lord, we should seize it immediately. If we do not seize it, the light will fade. Hence, some brothers and sisters carry a notebook with them to write down the feelings that come from God&rsquo;s speaking and shining. Then they pray according to these feelings. If we do not seize the light, the light will fade and make no further impression on us. Many of us have had the experience of light shining upon us in the morning but fading by the time we fellowship with others at night. Therefore, we must seize the light and fix our eyes on the light. Even when we read the Bible, it is good to briefly write down the light and feelings that we have received. The shining we receive will be a supply of life that enlivens us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DARKNESS NOT CONQUERING THE LIGHT</h2>
<p>Fifth, the darkness cannot conquer the light. The darkness of man cannot conquer the light. Man may reject the light, but man&rsquo;s rejection does not negate the light. Man has no way to conquer the light. As long as the light is of God, man has no way to conquer it. The light that shines on us today will come to shine on us tomorrow; it will shine on us this month, and it will shine on us in the following month.</p>
<p>Our Lord Jesus has been shining on the earth for two thousand years. Many people reject Him and resist Him, yet they cannot overcome Him or conquer Him. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness does not overcome it. We may reject it, oppose it, or ignore it, but it is still shining. The light is shining on man because the darkness cannot overcome or conquer the light. Thus, even if some do not receive the light, others will receive it. Hence, John 1:12 says, &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God.&rdquo;</p>
