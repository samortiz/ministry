For such a reality, we need the solid foundation of teaching. Then we can go on from this foundation to share something of our experience.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH AND THE CHURCH AS THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST AS REVEALED IN ROMANS</h2><p>If we speak from the book of Romans about Christ as the life and content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ, we need to show people the whole structure of the book of Romans. Romans is a full record of the entire Christian life, including the inner life and the church life. It starts from our being sinners under God&#8217;s condemnation (1:18-3:20). This is why we need Christ&#8217;s redeeming blood so that we can be justified before God (3:21-5:11). Thus, the first part of the book of Romans shows us that we were sinful under God&#8217;s condemnation, but we have been justified by God through the redemption of Christ. We have been justified, saved, redeemed, and brought back to God.<p>Then Romans goes on to tell us how God works in us for our sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. On the negative side, God gets rid of our old nature, our old man, to make Christ our new nature, our new man. This work is done through the cross on the negative side and the Spirit on the positive side. We have to experience the cross, to be identified with the death of Christ. The cross must do away with all the old things of the old nature, all the things of the self, and all the natural things. This is pointed out in chapter six of Romans.<p>Then chapter eight tells us that after the work of the cross, we are living and walking in and by the Spirit. This means that we are living in Christ and walking by Christ. In this way we are daily and gradually conformed to the image of Christ. In other words, we are gradually made the image of Christ to be the expression of Christ. Our old nature, our old self, the &#8220;I,&#8221; has been done away with by the cross, and all of what Christ is has been wrought into us. Christ has been made our life and even our daily walk, our living. Now we are persons who are not living by ourselves but by Christ. We are not walking in ourselves but in Christ. There has been a translation from the old nature into the new nature and from the old man into the new man by the cross and the Spirit. We have been translated into Christ through the working of the cross and the moving of the Spirit.<p>God is doing a work of translating us out of Adam into Christ, out of the self into Christ. This translating work is the sanctifying work, the transforming work, the conforming work, and the glorifying work. Now we are under the process of sanctification. The more we are sanctified, the more we are transformed, conformed, and glorified. When we are fully sanctified, that will be the day of our glorification. This is the content of the section of Romans 5:12 through 8:39.<p>Holiness is God Himself. The more God works Himself into us, the more we become holy. We can see this in the type of the tabernacle. All the boards of the tabernacle were of wood overlaid with gold. The wooden boards were sanctified, made holy, by being overlaid with gold. To be sanctified does not mean to be cleansed or to be kept away from filthy and worldly things. To be sanctified means to be overlaid with gold, signifying the divine nature. The more we are overlaid with the divine nature, the more we are sanctified. The divine nature is not only the holiness but also the glory. When the boards were overlaid with gold, they became holy and were in the glory. They were glorified by being overlaid with gold. The more we are overlaid with the divine nature of God, the more we are sanctified and glorified.<p>Sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification are actually one thing. We have been justified, but we need to be translated from the old being into the new being, from the old nature into the new nature. We have to be overlaid with the divine nature, to be sanctified. All that we are has to be swallowed up by Christ. Then we are transformed, conformed to the image of Christ, and glorified to become the expression of Christ.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
