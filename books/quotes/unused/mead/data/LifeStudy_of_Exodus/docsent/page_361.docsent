   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN ETERNAL DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you would read through all twenty-seven books of the New Testament and study each verse related to Christ s redemption, the death of Christ, or the cross of Christ, you still will not have a clear view of what the death of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ s death is great and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the Bible, it is not simply a temporal death it is an eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to Revelation 13:8, in the sight of God, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, He is the eternal Redeemer, and His death, unlike that of sinful human beings, is an eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot understand the death of Christ in full.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Certain aspects of the redeeming death of Christ simply cannot be explained.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the grating signifies the all-inclusive Christ with His eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He bore the burning and the weight of the righteous judgment of God exercised upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But although the picture of the altar portrays this, we still cannot understand in full all the details related to Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE ASHES AND THE FRAGRANCE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One matter related to the altar that I do not fully understand is the ledge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Regarding the ledge and the grating, the two words under and beneath are used.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I believe that the ledge with the grating beneath it formed a hearth, a place of burning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As I have pointed out previously, the ledge may have protected the acacia wood inside the bronze covering on the four sides of the altar from being scorched by the intense heat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, I cannot say exactly what the spiritual significance of the ledge is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It may signify the support given to Christ as He bore God s judgment on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As He was bearing the burning of God s righteous judgment, He, as a human being, certainly needed something to sustain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The ledge may signify the support given to the redeeming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would ask you to consider again the picture of the altar with the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the wood and the sacrifices burned on the grating, the sweet fragrance ascended to God, and the wood and the sacrifices were reduced to ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To repeat, ashes are a strong confirmation that we have been accepted by God and that our sins have been forgiven by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we can have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ashes are a sign of this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The ashes, therefore, are for us, whereas the sweet fragrance is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May we all be impressed with the redeeming Christ as signified by the grating and the altar of the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE REDEEMING CHRIST ISSUING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The grating issues in the four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The rings were not added to the grating; neither were they welded to it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the record, the four rings came out from the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe that the four ends of the crossbars of the grating were inserted into holes in the side.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I also believe that the ends of the bars projecting out through the holes in the altar were fashioned into rings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the rings were not separate from the grating, but formed one piece with it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I do not believe that after the grating was made, four rings were fashioned and then connected to the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The rings forming one piece with the grating indicates that the redeeming Christ issues in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit is not added to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Certain Christians have a concept that the Spirit has been added to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the revelation in the Bible is that Christ issues in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, the all-inclusive Spirit is identical to Christ, and Christ is identified with the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The four Gospels present the grating, the redeeming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The redeeming Christ is absolutely a Person of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was born of the Spirit, He was filled with the Spirit, and He was always under the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, this redeeming Christ issued in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, according to the New Testament, the redeeming Christ became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the night before His crucifixion, the Lord Jesus told His disciples that another Comforter would come John 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this prophecy the Lord indicated that this Comforter would be Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He, the Lord Jesus, would be the second Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When He was speaking regarding this, He was the first Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, the first Comforter is the redeeming Christ; the second Comforter is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The second Comforter is not another one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, the first Comforter came back in another form as the second Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is signified in typology by the grating issuing in the four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many years ago, when I was in organized Christianity, I held the concept that Christ and the Spirit were separate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to this concept, Christ has ascended to heaven and remains there, and the Spirit has come to earth in His place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that the first has gone and that the second is here.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But through the study of the Bible and through more experience, I began to realize that these two, Christ and the Spirit, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The second, the Spirit, issues out of the first, Christ, and Christ issues in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 15:45 that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Who is this last Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The last Adam is the redeeming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now this last Adam, the redeeming Christ, is a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Concerning the altar, the burning depended on the grating, but the moving depended on the four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The rings, however, were not separate from the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As we consider this picture, we see that Christ, the Redeemer, is the grating, and the Spirit, typified by the rings, is for strengthening and moving.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have seen that the entire grating with the weight of the wood and the sacrifices was upheld by the four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the four rings had been taken away, the grating and everything on it would have fallen down.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Apart from the four rings, the grating had no support, no strength.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The grating could stand in place and bear a heavy load for the burning judgment of God because the grating was upheld by the four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, the rings were not only the power for moving, but also the strength for upholding the grating.</S>
