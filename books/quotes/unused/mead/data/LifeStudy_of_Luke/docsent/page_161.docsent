   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Sign of His Success</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ s resurrection was also a sign of the success of His achievement.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose Christ had remained in the tomb after He died.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If such had been the case, then what Christ did would not have been a success.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the Man-Savior s resurrection from the dead is a strong sign of His great success in His universal achievement.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His Victory</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ s resurrection was also His victory over the world, Satan, death, Hades, and the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These five things caused the Lord Jesus to be put into the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when He came forth from the tomb in resurrection, this was His victory over the world, Satan, death, Hades, and the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As Peter says in Acts 2:24, Whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because Christ is resurrection John 11:25 , death could not hold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is impossible for death to hold resurrection; resurrection overcomes death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His Glorification</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ s resurrection was also His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ s resurrection brought Him into glory Luke 24:26; 1 Cor 15:43a; Acts 3:13a, 15a .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord s divine nature, His divine being, was concealed and confined within His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through death the confinement of His humanity, His flesh, was broken, and then in resurrection He was released as the very God with His nature and riches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because He was released from the confinement of His flesh in resurrection, He was glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was the reason the Lord said to the disciples on the way to Emmaus that it was necessary for Christ to suffer and enter into His glory Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was through His resurrection that He entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His Transfiguration</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, Christ s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was Christ in the flesh, but He has been transfigured into the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who essentially is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Resurrection was His actual transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before His death and resurrection, He was transfigured on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, that transfiguration was only temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His actual transfiguration was His resurrection, for in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who imparts life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Germination of the New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ s resurrection was also the germination of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just as His death was the termination of the old creation, so His resurrection was the germination of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What He terminated in His death He germinated in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This germination includes us; we were regenerated through His resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, His resurrection is our germination and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way we have become the new creation 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are regenerated people in His new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Producing the Church</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, Christ s resurrection produced the church as His Body, even as His reproduction John 12:24; 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the church is Christ s reproduction in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord Jesus was incarnated, He was an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when He was resurrected, He became corporate, a corporate Christ 1 Cor 12:12 , the Christ who is both the Head and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to understand these seven aspects of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Resurrection was God s vindication of the Lord s life and work, resurrection was the Lord s great success in His universal achievement, resurrection was His victory over all enemies, resurrection was His glorification, resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit essentially, resurrection was the germination of the new creation, and resurrection produced the church, the Body, as Christ s reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These matters are clearly revealed in the Acts and Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all need to know Christ s resurrection to such an extent.</S>
