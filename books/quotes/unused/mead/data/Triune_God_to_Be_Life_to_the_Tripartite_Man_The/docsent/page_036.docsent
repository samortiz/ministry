   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN TO BE SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE DIVINE LIFE OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10; 8:2, 6b, 4; 12:2a; 6:19b, 22b; 12:2b; 8:6; Col 3:4; Rom 12:1, 3-5; 8:29b, 6, 11, 30c; Phil 3:21; Rom 8:11, 23; 5:17; 16:20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To be saved in the divine life of Christ is something which is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many times fundamental Christians will ask people, "Have you been saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was asked this question more than fifty-five years ago, I would respond very emphatically by saying, "Yes, I certainly have been saved."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if you ask me this same question today, I may say, "Well, it is hard to say.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yes, I have been saved in some areas, but there are still too many areas where I have not been saved."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have been eternally saved from eternal perdition, eternal judgment, and eternal death in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in terms of being released from the law of sin, we still have not been fully saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Romans 7:15, 17, and 20, Paul said, "For what I do, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do...So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me....But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These verses indicate that the evil Paul practiced was due to the indwelling sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans 7 is a matter of the indwelling sin, and Romans 8 is a matter of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sin is the embodiment of Satan, and Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These two embodiments are within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ as the embodiment of God is in our spirit, and sin as the embodiment of Satan is in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our loss of temper is an indication that we have not been released from the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may seem to be very holy one moment, but after only a few minutes, we may lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we lose our temper, the law of sin is operating within the members of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, we have not been completely saved from the bondage, the slavery, of sin, the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On some occasions, we experience being saved from the bondage of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But at other times, we are defeated by the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At such times, we, like Paul, may say, "Wretched man that I am" Rom 7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we have a more thorough knowledge of ourselves and the Lord's way of saving us, we cannot boldly say that we are saved in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can only say that we have been saved in some things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are still many other things in which we have not yet been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the Christian life is a life of being saved continually.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans is a particular book because it contains many particular terms and subjects which are not covered in the other books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Justification, sanctification in life, transformation, and conformation are subjects which are unique to Paul's Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These subjects are stressed very much in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Phrases such as "present your bodies" 12:1 , "present your members as weapons" 6:13 , and "crush Satan under your feet" 16:20 are also unique and are used only in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is very useful in studying Romans to collect all of these particular terms, subjects, and phrases and to study them.</S>
