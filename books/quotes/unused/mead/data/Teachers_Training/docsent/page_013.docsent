   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Giving Lectures but Talking in a Personal Way</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As you are teaching the young people in your class, you should frequently talk to them in a personal and practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For instance, you might say, "Are you not unhappy when your brother or sister has something that you do not have?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you not hate that?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Also, have you not offended your parents many times?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you not have a sense deep within that it is wrong to offend your parents?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do you not realize that you should honor, respect, regard, and love your parents?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead of only covering the points in the lesson book, talk to the young people in a very personal way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every point of the lesson should be presented in a way that will create an experiential impression.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Apply every point to their actual situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When you teach a class in the Summer School of Truth, do not take the way of giving messages or lectures.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, you need to have personal talks with the young people, teaching every point experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As you are talking with them, you should be watchful over each one, paying particular attention to their expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This will help you to know the needs of your students.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then in the next class session you should endeavor to meet these needs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the Lord leads you, you may speak to certain ones in particular and then ask them to pray with you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way you will help them to open up, you will strengthen their praying spirit, and you will bring them into the experience of the truths which you are presenting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The principle is the same with preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we preach the gospel, we should not just gather people together and give them a message.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should have direct, personal contact with people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may give a message, but afterward, according to the condition of the attendants, we need to talk with them in a personal way about their need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we should pray with them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need to learn to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Stirring Up a Praying Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The hardest thing for us to do in teaching in an experiential way is to get people to pray with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may be able to give a message and talk with others, but when you come to the point where it is necessary to pray, you may be void of the praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are void of the praying spirit, you cannot stir up a praying spirit in someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you want to stir up a praying spirit in the person with whom you are speaking, you yourself must be a person who is full of the praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I hope that there will be much prayer in your class in the Summer School of Truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Adequate prayer will accomplish at least three things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It will impress the young people in an experiential way with the points of the lesson; it will stir up the praying spirit within them; and it will cause them to become living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who attend such a summer school will surely become very living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us not merely train the young people in our summer school with the knowledge of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Mere doctrinal knowledge is vain, and I have no confidence in it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, let us impress the young ones with truth as the reality of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the truth which we are burdened to impart to our young people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to carry out this burden, you need to put into practice all the points we have covered in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Be governed by a clear view of God's economy; fan into flame the gift of God which is within you; and be a person of prayer with an atmosphere of prayer who can stir up a praying spirit in others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a teacher in the Summer School of Truth, you should be ready to pray at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then you will be able to teach.</S>
