   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Man s Spirit Being Unique</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Causing Man to Hunger for God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the Bible, human beings were created by God with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Zechariah 12:1 says, Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Job 32:8 says, There is a spirit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are different from the animals because we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No animal has ever worshipped something, but throughout human history every kind of people has worshipped something.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even atheistic governments have been unable to suppress the worship of God, because God created man with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just as we have an appetite for physical food and grow hungry several times each day because we have a stomach, so we have a spiritual appetite and hunger for God because we have a spiritual stomach our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Calling On the Lord to Receive God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>and Living God as a God-man</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is available to be received by man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, we have a spirit, which causes us to hunger after God and is our organ to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the Spirit, the processed Triune God is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is on the throne in heaven, and He is also everywhere on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Triune God is like the air, which is constantly present around us and comes into us anytime we breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Speaking of Christ, Romans 10:8 says, The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Calling on the Lord is our spiritual breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The processed Triune God as the Spirit comes into us when we simply say, O Lord Jesus! v. 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the Spirit is always present and available, we should no longer live by the natural life or the self.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God does not want us to live merely a good life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Good and bad both belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, God wants us to live Him, to live as God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A married couple may decide to love and honor each other.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, even if they are successful for a time, they are living as good men, not as God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wants His people to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of making up our mind to be good, we should simply pray, Lord, thank You that You are the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thank You for creating me with a spirit and for regenerating my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the all-inclusive Spirit, You are now in my spirit and are one spirit with me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I just want to live You.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we pray sincerely in this way, we will spontaneously be good, not by our endeavoring or striving but by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE FUNCTION OF</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE, INDWELLING SPIRIT The Law of the Spirit of Life</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Being a Spontaneous Operating Power</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Romans 8:2, 9, and 11, He is the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the resurrecting One.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit is not only rich but also living, active, and functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is neither silent nor dormant in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to see, open to, and enter into the function of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The spontaneous operating of the law of the Spirit of life is the first function of the all-inclusive Spirit v. 2 . A law is a natural power that works automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, if someone who is holding a book releases it, the law of gravity will immediately and spontaneously function to cause the book to fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The all-inclusive Spirit in us is such a law, a spontaneous power that works automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we call on the Lord, we switch on this law, and the Spirit is activated in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I was a teenager, the barbershop in my hometown in China did not have an air conditioner or electric fan to cool the customers in the summertime.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, they had a fan hanging from the ceiling that was operated by a boy who constantly pulled a string.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the boy was distracted or tired, he sometimes neglected his duty and would be chastised by the barber.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After being admonished, the boy would make up his mind to pull the string regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, when the barbershop eventually obtained an electric fan, there was no longer the need for a boy to make up his mind to carry out a required task.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead, when the fan was needed, someone only had to switch it on.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today the Spirit within us is like an electric fan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, we do not need to make up our mind to live properly and virtuously by our own effort, which does not work well anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, we only need to switch on to activate the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit has been installed in our being, and this Spirit is a natural law, a power that works automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Spirit of Life Supplying Life to Us</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As the Spirit of life, the all-inclusive Spirit continually supplies life to us v. 2 . He Himself is the life and the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His function is to minister life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we are praying or calling on the name of the Lord, we sense deep within that life is flowing in to supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This supplying is the function of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To try to do good, improve ourselves, or behave better is to be unbelieving.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must believe in the indwelling, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is real, and He is within us, supplying us with life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not focus on ourselves; instead, we simply need to call on the name of the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The way to cause the all-inclusive Spirit to function in us is to pray continually by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we call, we touch the Spirit and cause the Spirit to function.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we receive the supply of life by the functioning of the indwelling Spirit.</S>
