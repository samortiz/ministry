   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Key to Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 1:1 is the key verse to the entire book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Just this one key can open all the doors.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have the master key.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can go to any door and open it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must pick up 1:1 as the master key.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The key point is "by signs."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the pictures in this book are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Fundamental teachers would surely agree that Christ as a lamb does not have four legs and a little tail.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They would not make such a ridiculous interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But what about the New Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I was young, I also believed that the New Jerusalem was a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was happy in the belief that one day we would be in a mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As part of our gospel preaching, we had a song about how we would enter the pearly gates and walk on the golden street.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gradually, however, as I studied the Bible I found out that the New Jerusalem is a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Who would marry a literal city?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even if that city had twelve gates of pearl and a golden street, would anyone marry it?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In studying and understanding the Holy Word, Christians often bring in their natural thought.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the new heaven and new earth we shall dwell in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But we must not think of the New Jerusalem as a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is God who will be our abode.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I was young, I heard some Bible teachers discussing what we would eat and where the restroom would be in the "heavenly mansion."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How poor it is to bring in our natural thought!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today I asked some saints if they are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they answered yes, I asked them to show me the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The New Testament tells us that the church is God's house, and that God is abiding in His house; but where is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church as God's house and as our home is not a physical building, but a composition of living believers 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a physical, lifeless entity, but an organic composition of living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It exists wherever the believers come together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church as God's house today is a composition of living persons; it is a corporate person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is true in this age and it will be true in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Consistent with the Whole Bible</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The thought of God's house is also in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moses says in Psalm 90:1, "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus said that if anyone loves Him, His Father and He will go to him and make an abode with him John 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We shall be His abode, and He will be our abode.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In John 15 the Lord says, "Abide in Me and I in you" v. 4 . First John 3:24 and 4:16 say that we abide in God and God abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this church age we are abiding in God, and God is abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you believe that when we enter into the new heaven and new earth we shall get out of God and God will get out of us?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If in this age we can dwell in God, taking Him as our dwelling place, and can give God a place in us, it is not logical to think that in eternity we will no longer have Him as our dwelling place, but rather live in a golden city as our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must believe that our abiding in the Lord and His abiding in us will be intensified, enlarged, and uplifted to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why John says he saw that the city had no temple in it, "for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb" Rev 21:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a strong indication that the city is not a physical place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this city the temple is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This Person is God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The very Triune God will be the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the temple within the city is a Person, do you believe the city could be something lifeless?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since the temple is a divine Person, the Triune God Himself, the city must be persons also.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Actually the entire city is the Holy of Holies with three equal dimensions 1 Kings 6:20; Rev 21:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since the Triune God will be the temple and the entire city will be the Holy of Holies, the city cannot be something physical.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It must be an organic composition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In New Testament times God's dwelling on this earth was firstly a single Person, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was God's tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then following Him, the church is God's temple Eph 2:21-22; 1 Cor 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Jesus, a single Person, was God's tabernacle, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the church as a corporate person became the temple of God, God's dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After the New Testament age, when we get into eternity, God's dwelling will not change from living persons to a lifeless, physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must believe that these persons built together as God's dwelling place will be enlarged and intensified.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the coming age there will be an enlargement of these living persons as God's dwelling place.</S>
