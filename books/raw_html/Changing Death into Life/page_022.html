        <h2 class="head1">THE REAL NEED</h2>
<p>Our real need is life. The Lord Jesus did not use a method when He told the man who had been sick for thirty-eight years to rise up. Instead, the Lord Jesus made this man alive with life. He did not ask this man to strive or to struggle, but He uplifted him with the power of life. This man had been sick for thirty-eight years; he was almost completely worn out by death. He was barely living under the torture of death. Only the life that is able to swallow death could save and heal him. This man did not need any method or human effort; he needed the life that can swallow up death.</p>
<p>His need is our need. We have suffered from deadly poison and have sustained deadly wounds. We are dead because of sin, we are dead in sin, we are impotent because of death, and we sin. We cannot break away from sin. Our need is not human teaching or our effort; our need is to be enlivened. No method can extract the deadly poison within us or heal our deadly wounds. No effort can remove the element of death in us or turn back the harm of death in us. Only a living, powerful, and death-overcoming life can swallow up the death in us, giving us the deliverance of life and the healing of life. Such a life is what we, the impotent who are struggling in death, truly need. Such a life, however, cannot be received by any method or exertion, nor is it given by religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT RELIGION</h2>
<p>Methods cannot give us life, and religion cannot give us life. Methods cannot replace life, and religion cannot replace life. Religion can only restrict people outwardly; it cannot give them life inwardly. Religion teaches people based on a set of beliefs instead of giving people life. Religion is a set of doctrines, teachings, rules, and beliefs; it is not life, and it has no vitality. Hence, religion cannot render salvation to those who are dead in sin. Religion cannot meet the true need of those who are impotent because of death.</p>
<p>Many people think that they should turn to religion because human philosophies and moral doctrines cannot solve their problems or meet their needs. As a result, in addition to receiving the teachings of the sages, they also choose a religion. However, religion cannot solve their problems or meet their needs, just as human philosophies and moral doctrines cannot solve their problems or meet their needs. Human philosophies and moral doctrines cannot give people the life that raises them from the dead, nor can any religion give them this life.</p>
<p>The man who had been sick for thirty-eight years was not without a religion. He was in Judaism, which was the orthodox religion in his time. The beliefs, rules, rituals, and laws of Judaism came from God and were ordained by God. Hence, they were genuine and much higher than the beliefs, rules, rituals, and laws of pagan religions. However, such a high, genuine, and orthodox religion could not give the salvation of life to this sick man. If the water in the pool of an orthodox religion could not render salvation to this sick and impotent man, then no water in any other religion can render salvation.</p>
<p>Some people think that if religion cannot solve their problems and meet their needs, then Christianity can. Therefore, they &ldquo;join&rdquo; Christianity. But Christianity without Christ cannot solve their problems or meet their needs. Because some people join Christianity but do not receive Christ, they are still impotent and do not have salvation. They entered Christianity, but Christ has not entered into them. They have become &ldquo;Christians,&rdquo; but they have not received Christ. They keep the regulations of Christianity, but they do not have the life of Christ. They are &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; without Christ. They have a relationship with Christianity, but they do not have a relationship with Christ. They participate in Christianity as a religion, but they do not participate in Christ. They are impotent even though they are Christians, because it is Christ, not Christianity, who gives the salvation of life and makes people strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY CHRIST</h2>
<p>Mere Christianity is a dead religion and cannot give people the divine life. Only Christ can give life, because only Christ is life. Life is not in Christianity but in Christ. Christianity is not salvation; Christ is salvation. Hence, man needs Christ, not Christianity. Just as other religions cannot meet man&rsquo;s need, neither can Christianity meet man&rsquo;s need. Only Christ can meet man&rsquo;s need. Therefore, we are not inviting you to join Christianity; we are asking you to accept Christ. We do not want you to become a Christian who believes in a religion; rather, we want you to become a Christian who receives Christ. Whether Christianity is deformed or proper, it cannot save people. Only Christ can save people.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus saw the man who had been sick for thirty-eight years lying by the pool and asked him if he wanted to get well. The impotent man thought that the Lord was telling him about the old way of entering into the pool to receive healing. He did not realize that the Lord was going to save him without a method and without his own effort. When he said that he did not have the strength to enter into the pool, the Lord immediately said, &ldquo;Rise, take up your mat and walk.&rdquo; These wonderful words mean that this man did not need the pool. He did not need a method, nor did he need his effort or strength. He simply needed to receive the Lord&rsquo;s word. The Lord&rsquo;s word has power because the Lord&rsquo;s word contains life. When the impotent man heard the Lord&rsquo;s word, he was immediately made well, and he took up his mat and walked. This was not the effect of a method, nor was it the issue of his efforts. Rather, this is the Lord&rsquo;s salvation of life.</p>
<p>No method can save man, no amount of effort can save man, nor can religion save man. Only the Savior of life, the Lord Jesus, can save man. He is the Lord of life, the living Savior, and He can give the eternal and powerful divine life to man. The Lord Jesus does not give man doctrine, methods, or religion, all of which cannot save man. Only life can save man. Jesus is not doctrine, methods, or religion. He is a living Savior who can bring His living life into anyone. When this life comes, it becomes the vitality and the motivating power for us to walk. It is also the power that replaces all the weaknesses and problems that originate from death.</p>
<p>Man is dead. Hence, he cannot be saved by a method, human effort, or religion. Man needs a living Savior to bring him the salvation of life. When this Savior enters into man, He enlivens man with His life, thus delivering man from death and impotence.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago in Beijing, there was a man in his sixties who held a high political position. This man became very ill. Before his illness, he had some bad habits. One day while he was recovering from his illness, one of his relatives went to preach the gospel to him and exhorted him to believe in the Lord Jesus. He told her, &ldquo;I think that Jesus is inferior to Buddha.&rdquo; The next day there was a gospel meeting in Beijing, where the sick were healed by prayer. His relative invited him to hear the gospel. He thought, &ldquo;I am sick also. It might be good for me to go,&rdquo; and he went with her to the meeting. When the meeting was dismissed, some people remained to pray and ask for healing. A sick woman, who had been carried into the meeting, asked the preacher to pray for her. After the preacher prayed and laid his hands on her, she said, &ldquo;I want to sit up.&rdquo; Her family marveled. After she sat up, she said, &ldquo;I want to stand up.&rdquo; After she stood up, she said, &ldquo;I want to walk.&rdquo; Everyone recognized that this was a miracle. When the older man saw it, he was touched. He stood in the midst of the crowd and immediately bowed his head and offered a silent prayer, saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, You are truly a living God. I have seen You heal this woman. I am sick also, but I am not asking You to heal my sickness. I only ask You to forgive my sins. I have committed so many sins in my life. Please forgive me.&rdquo; After praying, he walked out of the chapel. While he was on his way home, he felt that his whole being had changed. Previously, Chinese opera had been his favorite pastime. He enjoyed going to the theater and listening to foreign dramas at home. This evening, however, he felt uncomfortable and disgusted when he heard the sound of a foreign drama. Later he realized that this feeling was the result of his being saved by the Lord. Therefore, he said, &ldquo;I do not want to be an official anymore, and I do not want any position. I just want to carry the Bible and tell the Chinese everywhere that Jesus is the living Savior, because only He can save people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This older man was not saved by methods. He was saved because he met a living Savior; he met the Lord Jesus. This Savior is the Spirit, the living God, and the Lord of life, who gives life and power.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
