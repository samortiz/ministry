   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SIMPLE WAY TO TOUCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In his Epistles Paul unveils to us clearly and emphatically the ultimate goal or objective of the Christian walk: "To know Him" Phil 3:10 ; "To me, to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 ; "Christ our life" Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Through these verses we can see that the reality and central point of the Christian life is simply Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As people who have been born of God and have Christ living within them, all Christians must be brought by the Lord's mercy to the point where they are no longer wholly caught up in studying about Christ, doing something for Christ, or even serving Christ, but rather are in the reality of touching and experiencing Him in a living way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 5:10 testifies, "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This "much more" must be more of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A Christian's initial salvation experience is indeed wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is now one who has been born of God, but "much more" he is to be saved by the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every person who knows Christ as his Savior can and must be brought into this experience of "much more," which is entering into the fullness and reality of a life wholly centered on Christ experiencing, touching, and enjoying Him moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>ACCOMPLISHING REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today the Lord has made Himself available to all Christians for them to contact and experience in a full and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible reveals to us that in the beginning Jesus Christ was God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then one day this very God became a man to dwell on the earth John 1:14 and to accomplish redemption for all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was among us as the Lamb of God that through the shedding of His blood we might partake of redemption Eph 1:7 and be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is indeed glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ became a man, lived on earth thirty-three and a half years, and accomplished redemption for all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if Christ had stopped here, this would be the summation of our Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All could enjoy forgiveness of sins, but none could be saved by His life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>None could touch and experience Him in a daily, practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What then did Christ do that every Christian may enter into this "much more" experience?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Was He only crucified and then buried?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Was that the end?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must praise Him that there is much more!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Shortly before His crucifixion He told His disciples that He was among them but that He was going to be in them John 14:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How could this be accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If Jesus had only died and been buried and that was the end, He could never have entered into His disciples, nor could He enter into His people today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But, praise the Lord, that three days after His burial, He burst through the bonds of death and was raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So let us ask the question: In what form is He today?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"The last Adam Christ became a life-giving Spirit" 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jesus had told His disciples that He would enter into them; therefore, shortly after His resurrection He appeared before them in a room in which the doors were closed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He could never have done this had He not been the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There, "He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that moment Jesus, who had been among them and outside of them, came into them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ could never have entered into His disciples had He not been the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"The Lord is the Spirit" 2 Cor 3:17 , and all that have been reconciled to God have this life-giving Spirit dwelling within them to be their bountiful supply and all they need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since Christ has become the Spirit and has entered into every Christian, He is now so available to them; He is so easy for them to contact, experience, and even enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Much more we will be saved in His life."</S>
