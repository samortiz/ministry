We have to arrange for drills and practices. Others should not only understand what to do, but they must also be given the opportunity to practice and make trial runs. This is very important. A worker must not only be capable of working by himself but must also be able to direct others to the work. The work of "prayer and the ministry of the word" is not for everyone. Even Stephen had to remain a server of tables. Hence, every one of us has to practice doing things in the proper way. This is particularly true for doing things which are difficult, unfamiliar, and new; there is the need to have practice sessions ahead of time.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THOSE<br />WHO HAVE COMMITTED MISTAKES</h2><p>Some may ask, "What should we do with those who have committed mistakes?" There are two kinds of people who make mistakes. The first are the lazy ones; those who are lazy often make mistakes. The second are the proud ones; those who are proud also make mistakes easily. A lazy person is uncaring and unconcerned, while a proud person thinks that he can do everything. Those who are proud should be given some form of punishment when they make a mistake. They can be told that they will no longer be assigned such a responsibility. Everyone else will have an assignment in the service; they alone will be left out. They must humble themselves before they will be given another assignment. If a lazy person commits a mistake, he should be exhorted; he must not be allowed to give up. The more he wants to give up, the more we have to force him to do it. We have to perfect him. If he makes a mistake again, we have to go to him again. We have to force him to take up responsibilities; he cannot remain an uncaring and irresponsible person. The prouder a person is, the less he should be assigned responsibility, but the lazier a person is, the more he should be assigned work. It is a sign of laziness to refuse to work by using preaching as an excuse. More than half of the reason for neglect among the co-workers is laziness.</p><p>The above seven guidelines are principles of managing affairs. They are methods of doing things. If we follow these principles and carry them out properly, we will be of great use to the Lord's work. There is always room for more learning in the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 48</div><br></body></html>
