[1]  The New Way to Carry Out the Increase and Spread of the Church CONTENTS
[2]  BY KNOCKING ON THEIR DOORS Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; 1 Tim 2:4; Acts 4:31 Bring a meeting to them in their homes.
[3]  First, when we are going to knock on people s doors we must learn one thing we are not going out to invite people to our meeting.
[4]  If you go to visit some saints who have been absent from the meeting for five years, you can go to them and have a meeting in their home.
[5]  The best way to get yourself prepared is to pray to contact the Lord, not to pray for your going out, not to pray for the gospel work, but to pray to fellowship with the Lord.
[6]  Let Him enlighten you so your entire being will be brought fully into light; let Him shine in you, upon you, over you, and through you.
[7]  I want to stress one thing when you go to knock on doors, do not invite people to come to your meeting.
[8]  Also, when you go in do not talk to them too much.
[9]  You may speak two sentences of greetings, and then tell them you want to present the gospel or the truth to them.
[10]  You have to pray that the Lord would give you the instant utterance, speaking the same thing to present the gospel and the truth but by different utterance with different people.
[11]  When you talk to an older man you should use one kind of expression, and when you talk to a young lady or young boy you have to change your utterance.
[12]  If he is saved, you do not need to repeat the gospel, but you surely have to present the truth.
[13]  The more you speak your own word, the more impact you will lose because your contacts do not know who you are or what your status is.
[14]  If you ask this, surely most of the people would say no. No one trains their little children to say no, but they spontaneously know how to say no. A knowledgeable mother would never ask the children, Would you eat this? She would tell the children to eat it, leaving them no choice.
[15]  After they pray, you must have the boldness to assure them with a verse that they are saved, and the best verse is Romans 10:13 Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[16]  You have to give them this verse and assure them with this verse that they have been saved.
[17]  If you ask them, they would probably say that they do not think, believe, or feel that they are saved.
[18]  After they pray and have been given the assurance that the Lord Jesus lives in them, you need to say, Let us be baptized.
[19]  IN THE HOMES OF THE NEW CONTACTS Scripture Reading: Eph 5:18-19; Col 3:16 Make an appointment in the first contact for the following meetings.
[20]  According to our past study and experience, if you would knock on people s doors in this way, you will not be altogether rejected.
[21]  The home which you gain may have only three persons, but after a number of weeks their relatives, in-laws, and friends will come in. Do not forget that when you go to knock on people s doors, it is to get a home.
[22]  From the second time you go to visit them you must begin to do one wonderful thing, that is, to set up a meeting in their home.
[23]  I hope that when people open their doors to you and you go in, you would not be persons so dear and precious yet unable to do anything.
[24]  You may sing poorly, but if you sing in life, you will stir up people s interest to consider the spiritual things.
[25]  Then you must pray, and tell them to follow you in the way you are praying.
[26]  CHAPTER THREE THE WAY TO LEAD PEOPLE TO GROW
[27]  IN THE HOME MEETINGS Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:2-3; Heb 5:12-14 Nourish them by using the New Life Lessons.
[28]  Now I have the assurance to say that one saint, who really has the heart to go out for the Lord and knock on doors, will get one home within one month one saint, one home, one month.
[29]  In a month you will knock on about twenty-five doors and according to the rate of one out of twenty-five doors, you will gain one home.
[30]  If there is some time left, you could go back to pray-read the main verses quoted in the lesson in order to impress them with such verses.
[31]  In Lesson One, John 6:47 is quoted which says, Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life.
[32]  You may say, Thank You, Lord, I believe in You.
[33]  CHAPTER FOUR THE WAY TO NOURISH THE NEW CONVERTS
[34]  When you send spiritual food to people s homes, you must have the boldness to put it on the table.
[35]  TO CALL ON THE LORD AND TO PRAY-READ
[36]  It is not that you invite them to come to your meeting, but it should be that they would invite you to go to their meeting.
[37]  To nourish the new converts in their home meeting, you have to tell them that the Bible is the word of God.
[38]  In one visit, you can read them the verses at the beginning of this chapter and help them to pray-read, telling them that we live not only by physical food, but by every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God Matt 4:4 .
[39]  Then read John 6:63, where the Lord Jesus says, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life, and tell them that the way this word becomes spirit and life is by our taking it into us.
[40]  We must also lead the new converts to mingle the Word with their prayer.
[41]  This is not merely to read, or to repeat, but to mingle the word of the Bible with their prayer, that is, to make their prayer one with the word of the Bible.
[42]  Then the Lord s words will be spirit and life to you, and you will have the light of life John 8:12; cf.
[43]  If you could do all these things, you will not only lead them into the nourishment, but you will also lead them into the proper way to have a living home meeting.
[44]  Every weekend you should go out to get new homes, but on the week days you have to go out to visit the homes you have gained.
[45]  When you have a home that you need to take care of, you can ask a certain brother or sister to go with you to help you.
[46]  CHAPTER FIVE THE WAY TO FORM THE VISITING TEAMS
[47]  We should pray, Lord, we are all in the church, and the church is now picking up the new way to go out to knock on people s doors.
[48]  After our experience in Taiwan, I have the confidence with the full assurance that it is the Lord s way to go out to visit people s homes by knocking on their doors and to set up meetings in every home.
[49]  The Bible gives us the principle, however, that if there is no church you should follow the Spirit according to the situation; but if there is a church, you must follow the Spirit through the church.
[50]  I may be taking the lead to speak in a visiting team, but I could never forget my past or my old way of preaching.
[51]  Some may say that you need to believe in Jesus because if you believe in Him you will have many blessings: your business will make more money, you will be promoted, and your health will always be strong.
[52]  Then the Lord told them, Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides to eternal life, which the Son of Man shall give you v. 27 . The Lord Jesus turned them from the miracles, from the signs, to the inner life.
[53]  You should not stay in any home over thirty minutes.
[54]  Set up a rule to visit at least four families when you go out for two hours.
[55]  If you would leave the unpromising ones and go on to knock on other doors, you will find a promising home.
[56]  If you say that you do not like this legality, this means that you do not want to breathe.
