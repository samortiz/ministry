   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO DEAL WITH OUR OPINIONS AND OLDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One major thing which shows you that you are not opinionated is that you simply follow the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is not so easy, especially if you are older than the other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is also not easy for many of the sisters to follow the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some sisters may say that God is not fair, because the woman must always be under the man 1 Cor 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even after they get saved and come into the church, they still hold this opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was a co-worker among us many years ago who was very opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Nee once said to me, "This brother is a very good brother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever you ask him to go west, he will go east."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The brothers got to know this peculiarity in this brother's character, so when they wanted him to go west, they would ask him to go east.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then he would go west.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of nature is still in our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are not so willing to follow others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time Paul wrote 1 Corinthians, everybody knew that he was a leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If such a leading one proposes something to you, you should take his proposal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time Paul had a heavy burden for the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some there were saying that they were of Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Surely if Apollos would have gone there, his going would have been a great help.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I believe Paul explained this to him when he advised him to go to see them, but Apollos refused to go.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In principle Apollos should have gone even out of politeness, but he was so strong to say that he would go at another time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not want to go at Paul's proposal but at his convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are a number of ways to take from Anaheim to the airport in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes the brothers may have different opinions about which way to take.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more they discuss which way to take, however, the more time they waste.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is better to let the driver of the car make the decision, and not express any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Throughout the years I have seen the damage caused by opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I was on mainland China with Brother Nee, he was like a big umbrella taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the troubles from opinions went to him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then the Lord brought me out of China and put me in the Western world, where I had to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I saw the damage caused by different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Very rarely did I adjust these opinions, because I do not like to make an issue of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now that you are in the full-time training, you have to learn how to take the regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regulations do not give you any ground for opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you drive a car, you have your choice, but when you get on a train, you do not have any choice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now that you are in the training, you are on the train.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That means you are under the regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The training gives you the regulations to help you grow in life, and these regulations spontaneously kill your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have seen many of the Lord's servants through the years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The most useful ones are the ones without opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do not care for their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They care for only one thing the main goal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They stick themselves to the main goal, which is the carrying out of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a driver's main purpose is to get to the airport in Los Angeles, what way we take to get there does not really matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To debate about which way to take is to waste time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You have to learn how to stick yourself to the main goal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Forget about different ways to express your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You young saints who are learning how to serve must learn this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The thirty items of a proper character, to which I referred in the previous message, are very helpful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But in another sense, each of these items is your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Each item is your enemy because each item regulates you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This regulation is a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Each of the thirty items of a proper character kills your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Your problem in serving the Lord is your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One trainee told us that the rooms in which the trainees stayed were too small.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every opinionated person is a good-hearted one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you did not have a heart for anything, you would have no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A piece of stone has no opinion, but because your heart is strong and good, you have an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you did not have a heart for others, you would have no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because this trainee has a good heart for the other trainees, his opinion came out.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When you come to a new place and do not express any opinion, that is wonderful.</S>
