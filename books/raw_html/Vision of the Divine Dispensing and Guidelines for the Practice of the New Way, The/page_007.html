<P>The subject of this message is the divine dispensing and the increase of Christ. In simple terms, the divine dispensing is God working Himself into us. The result of this is the increase of Christ. The first part of John 3 speaks of regeneration, which is the divine dispensing, and the second part concerns the regenerated ones, who have the life of God, becoming the bride of Christ as His increase.</P><P>Today, the church as the bride of Christ is the increase of Christ, in the same way that Eve as the counterpart of Adam was the increase of Adam. Just as Eve came out of Adam and belonged to Adam, the two becoming one, resulting in the increase of Adam; in the same way the church came out of Christ, being joined to Christ, becoming one spirit with Him, resulting in her being the increase of Christ.</P><P>In the first message, we have seen the accomplishment of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The whole Gospel of John tells us how the Word, who was God and who was there in the beginning, became flesh to experience the human living and was crucified and resurrected to become ultimately the holy Breath, which is the life-giving Spirit breathed into the believers. The God who was there in the beginning has become very near to us. He is so near that He is even in us. He has been processed and has accomplished His divine dispensing, being organically joined to us and mingled with us, making us the bride of Christ, which is His Body, His ultimate increase.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE IMMEASURABLENESS OF CHRIST</H2><P>John 3:31-36 reveals to us that Christ is unlimited and immeasurable. Such an unlimited and immeasurable One came from above and is above all, being transcendent above everything. Moreover, the Father has given all into His hand. He is sent from God, speaking God's word. He gives the Spirit without measure. The giving of His Spirit is His divine dispensing, and the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. We can say that a table is the ultimate consummation of many individual pieces of wood. In the same way, the Triune God in eternity has been processed to ultimately become the Spirit, who as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God is dispensed into us, the believers.</P><P>This divine dispensing of God is a matter in life. We know that everything that has to do with life is not peculiar, but is very normal. For us to have God inside of us does not necessarily mean that we will have some unusual feelings. When a person has God, he simply has Him. But when he has a problem with God, immediately he will feel wrong within. This shows that God is indeed within him. Since God's dispensing, which is His giving to us of the Spirit, is without measure, we should fellowship with Him in a faithful way, and we should allow the Lord to fill us with His Spirit. In this way, He Himself will be dispensed into us in a rich way. This is not the so-called filling of the Holy Spirit known in the Pentecostal movement, which is claimed to produce strange feelings and peculiar occurrences. Rather, this is a genuine receiving of God's dispensing and an enjoyment of God Himself.</P><P>Every day we should have this kind of filling of the Spirit and this kind of dispensing from God. We have to know that for everything there is the need of time. Today, the Triune God has accomplished His divine dispensing. But on our part, there is still a step we need to take to receive His dispensing, which is to spend time to come to Him and to contact Him. For this reason, every day we need a definite time to fellowship with the Lord, to experience His presence, to receive Him within, and to be filled by Him.</P>
