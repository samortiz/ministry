   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TYPIFIED BY ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Israel as a type of Christ is more subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the ones chosen by God, they are God's kingdom, God's house, and God's household.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Israel as a type of Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, was chosen by Jehovah and upheld with the right hand of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Like Christ, Israel overcame the enemies by Jehovah and rejoiced and gloried in Him, the Holy One of Israel Isa 41:8-16; 42:1a; Rom 8:37; 1 Thes 2:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Israel also typifies Christ as the Witness of Jehovah Isa 43:10; Rev 1:5a; 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Just as the Spirit was poured out upon Christ, the Spirit of Jehovah was poured out upon Israel for the blessing of his offspring Isa 44:1-5, 21; Matt 3:16; Luke 4:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also in Israel, Jehovah was glorified, just as God was glorified in Christ Isa 49:3; 46:13b; John 17:1; 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Cyrus the king of Persia was working for Israel as Israel's servant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was not only serving God but also serving them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His pleasant service sent them back to their fathers' land and provided for them on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the ancient days, it was a long journey from Babylon, today's Iraq, to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The returned captives needed a lot of protection on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Otherwise, people could rob them and kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Cyrus did everything for them, and they went back to their forefathers' land, the Holy Land, safely.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was Cyrus's service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, on the one hand, we are Cyrus, and on the other hand, we are Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TYPIFIED BY ISAIAH THE PROPHET</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Isaiah also worked as a type of Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, to accomplish God's heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His prophecy helped in the release of Israel and the rebuilding of the temple and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Cyrus, the Gentile king, Israel, God's chosen people, and Isaiah, the prophet set up by God, all did the same thing to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They served to release God's people, to build up God's house, and to build up God's kingdom signified by the city.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Jesus came, He did the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Luke 4:18 says that Christ was anointed by God to release the captives.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He also built up the church as the temple of God and established the church as the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By this we can see that Cyrus, Israel, Isaiah, and Jesus Christ were all servants of God doing the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are four-in-one, and the first three Cyrus, Israel, and Isaiah are wrapped up with the last One, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In all the three you can see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Cyrus you can see Christ; in Israel you can see Christ; and in Isaiah you can see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today we are the servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need a vision to see Cyrus, Israel, and Isaiah typifying Christ as the Servant of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to have the realization that we are today's Cyrus, Israel, and Isaiah because we are one with our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all are God's servants doing the same thing in the universe to release God's people, to build up His temple, the house, and to build up His kingdom, the city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever I consider what I have been doing, am still doing, and will be doing to carry out God's good pleasure in this way, I become happy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we give ourselves to accomplish the desire of God's heart, we are the wisest men on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have the best job with the best destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to realize that our job as God's sent ones is the highest job.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Isaiah told us that he was sent with the Spirit of Jehovah by Jehovah Isa 48:16b .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God did not send Isaiah alone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was sent by God with God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The New Testament tells us that when the Lord Jesus was sent by the Father, the Father sent Him with the Spirit of God Luke 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Spirit was always with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, the Father who sent the Son also came with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jesus also said that He was not alone, but the Father was with Him John 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Jesus came, the three in the Godhead all came.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must have the assurance that when we go to people, the Spirit and Christ go with us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, Christ is the embodiment of the Father, so the Father goes with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we go out to preach the gospel, the Triune God goes with us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to experience this just as Isaiah did.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Isaiah typifies Christ as one made by Jehovah to be His mouthpiece to speak forth His word Isa 49:1-2; John 3:34a .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am happy because I am a mouthpiece to speak forth God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All of us should be happy in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All of us are mouthpieces to speak God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are not mouthpieces, we are not servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every servant of God speaks for God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must learn to speak Christ for God in many ways and in many aspects.</S>
