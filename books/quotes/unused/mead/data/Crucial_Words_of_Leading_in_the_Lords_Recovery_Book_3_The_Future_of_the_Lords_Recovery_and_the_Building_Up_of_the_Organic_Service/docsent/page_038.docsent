   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD DYING FOR ALL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THEREFORE ALL DYING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we sing Hymns, #456, we will certainly set our will to live for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second stanza says, Such love constrains me to answer His call, / Follow His leading and give Him my all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This speaks of a religious life in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some people may say that 2 Corinthians 5:14 says, The love of Christ constrains us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is true, but the entire verse says, The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not say that One died for all; therefore, all were forgiven and redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, it says that all died.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ died for us so that we would all die, not so that we would live for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 6:5 says, If we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>CONSECRATING OURSELVES NOT AS A NATURAL MAN</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>BUT AS A NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are some things that are right in traditional theology, but within those items there is always some hidden error, which is leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us take Hymns, #456 as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the things spoken of in this hymn are proper, but there is also something hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we sing this hymn repeatedly, everyone will set their will to live for Christ and follow His leading and give Him my all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Have we ever considered what our all is?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to Paul s word in Philippians 3:8, our all is just refuse, and it is not at all precious.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The book of Leviticus, in the Old Testament, speaks of many matters concerning the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>None of the offerings recorded in Leviticus typify us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sin offering typifies the Lord Jesus, the trespass offering typifies the Lord Jesus, the meal offering typifies the Lord Jesus, the peace offering typifies the Lord Jesus, and the burnt offering typifies the Lord Jesus chs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Where is the offering that typifies you and me?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the picture of the types, we do not offer ourselves; instead, we offer the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we feel that we are corrupted and sinful, we offer the Lord Jesus as our sin offering or as our trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We offer Him as food for God and for us as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We also offer Him as the peace offering and the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when do we ever offer up ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some people may say, Romans 12:1 speaks of presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, we must understand the entire book of Romans in order to comprehend the words bodies and living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 1 speaks of man s corruption, and chapter 5 speaks of the source of our corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Death and sin are our portion because we are in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Chapter 6 then speaks of our death and resurrection with Christ we are not the old I but the resurrected I. Chapter 8 says that the Holy Spirit is in us and that the work of the Holy Spirit is to sanctify, renew, and transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By this Spirit we need to put to death the practices of the body v. 13 . We do not put to death only the evil practices of the body; we need to put to death all the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only then does Romans speak of presenting our bodies in chapter 12.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This word is not spoken in chapter 1.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is spoken only after we have become those who are renewed, transformed, and worked on by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The apostle did not exhort us to present our corrupted bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He exhorted us to present our bodies after they have been transformed and worked on by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The bodies that are presented have Christ and the Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hymns, #456 gives us a natural understanding that we should live for Jesus, because stanza 2 says, Living for Jesus, who died in my place, / Bearing on Calv ry my sin and disgrace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, on the cross, the Lord Jesus did not only bear our sins and disgrace; even more, He terminated us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The apostle Paul s word says, The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died 2 Cor 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have been terminated; now we are a new creation, and what we offer to Him is the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But this hymn does not have this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It says only that the Lord Jesus died on the cross for us, bearing our sin and disgrace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is entirely objective; it is not subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By the end of the hymn, what we offer up is altogether a natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a consecration is difficult to accomplish because it must be done with clenched teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul says, I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must consecrate to the Lord the I who has Christ living within.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A. B. Simpson wrote a hymn that says, Oh! it is so sweet to die with Christ,... / Oh! it is so sweet to live with Christ Hymns, #482, chorus . To live for Jesus is an awful thing, and it is a suffering, but to live is Jesus is an enjoyment without suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To live for Jesus is altogether a suffering, whereas to live is Jesus is altogether an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Living for Jesus gives people the wrong understanding and makes them think that they have to do something in themselves for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In reality, however, He does not want us to do so many things for Him; He wants us to simply let Him live out of us.</S>
