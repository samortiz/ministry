   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN THE SIGNS IN JOHN TEN 1 Scripture Reading: John 10:1-39 A BOOK OF SIGNS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The record in the Gospel of John is deep and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In writing this Gospel John used certain cases from the Lord's ministry, cases that are regarded as signs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 20:30 and 31 he says, "Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These verses indicate that the Gospel of John is a book of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The various cases recorded in this Gospel, therefore, are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter three of John's Gospel we have the case of Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we consider this case, the more we shall be enlightened to know the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter four we have the case of the Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although this woman was immoral, she pretended to be religious and to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we consider this case, we see that only Jesus Christ is the fountain of living water that can quench the thirst in our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The water from Jacob's well cannot quench our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, Christ is the reality by which and through which we can genuinely worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Samaritans did not worship God in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only Christ can satisfy the thirst in our human life, and only He is the reality that can afford us the genuine worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In chapter five we have the case of an impotent man who had been sick for thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The background of this case was "a feast of the Jews" 5:1 , which was the feast of Purim recorded in the book of Esther According to the book of Esther, Haman's intention was to terminate the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the Jews' destiny was to be slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But God came in to change the day of termination into a day of liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That day was a day of the Jews' passing out of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the Jewish people had been released, they passed out of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the background of the Lord's word in 5:24: "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus is the real Mordecai, the One who rescues the Jews and brings them out of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter five of John we see how the Lord rescued the impotent man and caused him to pass out of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE FEAST OF DEDICATION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Chapters nine and ten of the Gospel of John are actually concerned with one case the case of a man who was blind from birth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this case also one of the Jewish feasts was the background.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The background in this case was the feast of Dedication.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 10:22 says, "At that time the feast of the Dedication occurred in Jerusalem, and it was winter."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The biblical record is economical, and no words are wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why, then, in a chapter concerned with Christ as life is there a verse telling us about the feast of Dedication?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Apparently, verse 22 has nothing to do with life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, it is very meaningful that this verse is included.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The feast of Dedication was a commemoration of the restoration of the polluted temple.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The temple had been polluted by a cruel Syrian king named Antiochus Epiphanes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The coming of this king was prophesied in chapters eight and eleven of the book Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Antiochus Epiphanes was the little horn that sprang out of one of the four horns.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the prophecy in Daniel, this king blasphemed God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He occupied the temple and polluted it by offering swine on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Daniel also prophesied that the wise among God's people would be bold to do valiant things against this evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One of these wise ones was Judas Maccabaeus, who took the lead to fight against Antiochus Epiphanes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a war that lasted approximately three years, Judas Maccabaeus was victorious, and the temple was restored and cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The feast of Dedication commemorates the restoration and purification of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A story has been told among the Jews that when Antiochus Epiphanes was about to seize the temple, the high priest concealed the flagon of oil used for lighting the lamps on the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the temple was restored by Judas Maccabaeus, there was not an adequate supply of oil to use in lighting the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually they found the flagon of oil, which had been sealed by the signet of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, that supply of oil was not sufficient to keep the lamps lighted for very long.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nevertheless, in a miraculous way that small supply of oil lasted for eight days.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to the story, the more the oil was used, the more its supply increased.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the feast of Dedication the Jewish people remembered that miracle by lighting lamps both in the temple and in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, the feast of Dedication, which lasted for eight days, was a feast of lights.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was during this feast that the Lord Jesus came to Jerusalem and gave sight to a blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although the feast of Dedication was a time of light, the blind man was in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 9:5 the Lord Jesus said, "While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The lights from the lamps in the feast of Dedication were of no help to the blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, in 9:5 the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, "I am the real light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Physical light cannot help you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You need Me as the light of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Josephus, a Jewish historian, calls the feast of Dedication a feast of lights.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As we have pointed out, during this feast the Jews lighted lamps in the temple and in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>With this feast as the background, the Lord Jesus came to Jerusalem to indicate to the Jewish people that He is the real light.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For the blind man to receive his sight was for him to receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As a result of receiving light, he came out of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But although the blind man had received his sight, the Pharisees were still blind and in darkness 9:39-41 .</S>
