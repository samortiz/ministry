   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FORTY-THREE THE EXPRESSIONS OF THE SAINTS BEFORE JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS Scripture Reading: Psa 135 139</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will consider Psalms 135 through 139.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we come to these psalms, I would first like to say a word concerning the arrangement of the one hundred fifty psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first one hundred nineteen psalms talk about the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 1 is on the law, and Psalm 119 also is on the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regarding the law, Psalm 1 is an excellent beginning, and Psalm 119 is an excellent ending.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In speaking about the law, Psalm 119 uses seven synonyms of the word law: testimony or testimonies, word, statutes, ordinances, precepts, judgments, and commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These seven synonyms issue in the way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In particular, Psalm 119 is on the law as the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the Bible this testimony is the testimony of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The law is a type, a symbol, of Christ as the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to understand this, we need to consider another type of Christ the ark of the testimony Exo 25:10-11, 16, 21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ark of the testimony was put into the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle, which is called the tabernacle of the testimony Exo 38:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible does not say that the law was put into the ark; rather, the Bible tells us that the testimony was put into the ark Exo 40:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The law contained, or concealed, in the ark is called the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Psalm 119 is followed by fifteen psalms called Songs of Ascents Psa 120 134 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The remaining sixteen psalms may be clustered into three groups Psalms 135 through 139, Psalms 140 through 145, and Psalms 146 through 150.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Psalm 135 and Psalms 146 through 150 are "hallelujah" psalms, for each of these psalms begins and ends with "Hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, as we will see, the nature of the content of Psalm 135 is different from that of Psalms 146 through 150.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These six psalms are all hallelujah psalms, but their contents are different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this message we will cover Psalms 135 through 139.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Each of these psalms has a striking point or significance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The striking point of Psalm 135 is the praise of Jehovah for His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The striking point of Psalm 136 is Jehovah's everlasting lovingkindness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second part of every verse in this psalm says, "For His lovingkindness is forever."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The striking point of Psalm 137 is the remembrance of Zion and the non-forgetting of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The psalmist said that the captives wept by the rivers of Babylon when they remembered Zion v. 1 . The psalmist went on to say that he could not forget Jerusalem v. 5 . The striking point in Psalm 138 is the thanking of Jehovah in the worship of His holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalm 139 speaks of God's omniscience and omnipresence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the striking point of this psalm is neither God's omniscience nor His omnipresence but the psalmist's asking Jehovah for His searching and trying.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here the psalmist seemed to be saying, "O Jehovah, search me and try me to see what is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only You can search me in this way because only You are omniscient and omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only You are qualified to search me and try me."</S>
