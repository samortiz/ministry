<P>Verse 13:"For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John." All the prophets prophesied until John. John did not prophesy. Instead, he pointed out the Lord to people, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" (John 1:29). This is where his greatness lies. He was great with respect to the time that he was in; his opportunity was different from that of others.</P><P>"He who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he." This does not mean that John's faith, morality, spirituality, conduct, and work were small and that he could not enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Rather, it is because those who are in the kingdom of the heavens can say that the work of Christ has been accomplished and that the High Priest has died. Yet John was in the city of refuge waiting for the death of the high priest. This was the reason that he was the least. This was also a matter of a difference in dispensation. Thus we see: (1) the prophets prophesied that the Savior was coming; (2) John pointed out the Savior in person to people; and (3) Christians have the Savior, whose work is accomplished. In the Bible the kingdom of the heavens refers to the part of the millennium that is related to reward. In other words, it is the reigning as kings for a thousand years. The kingdom of the heavens is the manifestation of God's heavenly rule on earth. What is difficult is determining the time interval between the future kingdom of the heavens and the present kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>Ordinarily, if we do not make a comparison, we cannot fully know a certain matter. Comparison brings forth knowledge. The scope of the church today is the same as the scope of the kingdom of God today. The scope of the kingdom of the heavens is smaller than both the scope of the kingdom of God and the scope of the church. The scope in which God gives grace to men is the church. Therefore, it is a matter of position. The kingdom of God is the sovereignty of God. All who believe in the Lord are subject to the authority of God. This is for both now and the future. Therefore, the church and the kingdom of God are likened to the two sides of the backbone. The kingdom of the heavens points to the coming millennium, in which a group of people will reign as kings. Not all who are in the church and in the kingdom of God today can enter into the kingdom of the heavens. Only the excellent ones can enter in. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were not in the dispensation of the law. Their reclining at table in the kingdom of the heavens probably refers to the enjoyment of the gospel.</P><P>Verse 14:"And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, who is to come." What God had prepared for man He presented before man to allow man to make the decision. The kingdom of God is of two aspects: (1) the spiritual sphere and (2) the coming kingdom of God.</P><P>Verses 15-19:John came in the way of mourning, whereas Christ came in the way of rejoicing. But the Jews showed no response or sympathy. The Lord showed us that both ways were rejected by the Jews: (1) In His righteousness God called them to repent, but they would not believe. (2) In His grace God called them to receive Christ, but they refused. John said that God hated sinners, but men did not feel sorrowful. The Lord said that God loves sinners, but men did not feel happy. "Wisdom is justified by her works." For the word works, some ancient authorities read children. Wisdom is Christ. This is the Christ on the earth, not the Christ in heaven; this is Christ incarnated, not Christ the eternal Word. This is Christ after His birth. The children of wisdom are the saved ones. Those who receive this wisdom are those who justify God's saving way. God's saving way is justified by all who receive the Lord.</P><P>Verse 20:"Then He began to reproach the cities in which most of His works of power took place, because they did not repent." The time for doing works of power and preaching the gospel cannot last for long. If there is no repentance, reproach will follow.</P><P>Verses 21-22:In the day of judgment, many people will suffer. How much they will suffer will be different, and the punishment they suffer will also be different. For those who have had more opportunities, the punishment will be heavier.</P><P>Verses 23-24:Until now, Capernaum is still in Hades. There are two different explanations concerning Capernaum, but regardless of which is correct, God's work is not seen among them today, and they are all like dead ones.</P><P>The purpose of chapter eleven is revealed in the last section. The history of the Lord's being rejected can be seen at the end of chapter nine. In chapter ten the Lord declared His rejection by men, for He was reviled and called Beelzebul. Chapter eleven speaks concerning how the Lord especially gained a remnant, and the end of chapter twelve records that the Lord was again rejected. After chapter thirteen, the line of doctrine is not as clear as the preceding twelve chapters. First, the Lord was the son of David; His first relationship was with the Jews. Then, He was also the son of Abraham; hence, He also had a relationship with the Gentiles. The Gospel of Matthew was written to the Jews, but it was not for the Jews. Matthew's record is according to doctrine. It recorded the small points with the main subject in view. Mark's record is according to history, but the emphasis is on Judea. Luke's record is according to morality. John's record is according to history, yet the emphasis is on Galilee.</P>
