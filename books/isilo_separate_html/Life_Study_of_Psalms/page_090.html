The Third Stage of the Experience of<br>the Presence of the Resurrected Pneumatic Christ<br>through the Valley of the Shadow of Death</H2><P>The third stage is the stage of the experience of the presence of the resurrected pneumatic Christ through the valley of the shadow of death (Psa. 23:4). Even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we do not fear evil, for the pneumatic Christ is with us (2 Tim. 4:22). This means that we experience His presence. For Him to be with us is for us to enjoy His presence. His presence is a comfort, a rescue, and a sustaining power to us when we are walking in the valley of the shadow of death.</P><P>We human beings cannot avoid having troubles as we live on this earth. A husband's wife who takes care of him and the children may suddenly become so ill that she is unable to walk. Then this brother gets into the valley, which is under a shadow and full of death. Some saints may have children who are crippled. This brings these saints into the valley. A brother may be an elder in a locality, and the Lord may suddenly bring in another elder, with whom it is difficult for this brother to coordinate. This other elder then becomes the valley of the shadow of death to the first elder. He cannot quarrel with this other elder, or he will offend his spirit. He has to keep the one accord with him. Also, his spirit will not allow him to withdraw. He has to stay in the valley to suffer. These are examples of the valley of the shadow of death.</P><P>About five years ago, I was put into a valley. In 1987 I was working in Taipei, laboring day and night on the Chinese Recovery Version of the New Testament. Then at the end of 1987, I returned to the United States and realized that there was turmoil present among us. During this rebellious turmoil, I was put into a valley. When we are in the valley, the best way for us to deal with it is to rest. The tests in the valley always tempt us to do something so that we can come out of the valley. But the more we do, the more the valley extends. We just need to be quiet, to rest.</P><P>Our resting in the Lord will shorten the valley, reduce the shadow, and remove the death. We should not talk about our being in the valley. The more we talk, the wider the valley becomes. The best way is for us to forget that we are in the valley, because we have the Lord with us. We do not fear evil, because He is with us. Second Timothy 4:22 says that the Lord is with our spirit. The Lord is not merely within us in a general way, but He is in our spirit in a particular way. If we have had the proper experience in the valley, we can testify that it was a place for us to enjoy the Lord's presence in such a close way.</P><P>In 1943 there was a big revival in the church in Chefoo, my hometown in mainland China. At that time we were under the invasion of the Japanese army. They were wondering how I could draw so many people. They studied me secretly for a few months, and then in May of 1943, they came to get me. They brought me to their military police headquarters, and I was put into prison for thirty days. That was a real valley to me. The Japanese invading army killed thousands of Chinese during the war, so I could have been killed by them at any time. I was under their threatening and torture for two three-hour sessions a day.</P><P>One day they put a young Greek man into the prison cell with me. He and I both spoke a little English, so we could communicate with each other. The Japanese did not know this. One day they purposely decided not to give me any food. One of them came to me and, not being able to speak Chinese, he pointed up to the heavens, indicating that I should ask my God to give me food. The young Greek man, however, insisted on sharing his food with me. He and I became intimate friends.</P><P>After a few weeks, he was taken away, and I was left alone in my imprisonment. One day when I was alone, as I was praying, I had a deep sense that the Lord was there with me in a special, intimate way. I was in the valley, and the Lord caused me not to fear any evil. Eventually, I was preserved and protected by the Lord from being harmed. After thirty days, the Japanese released me. That was a real experience and enjoyment of the Lord's presence in the deep valley of the shadow of death.</P><P>In the valley of the shadow of death, the Lord's rod and His staff&#151;His protection, His guidance, and His sustenance&#151;comfort us. The rod is for protection. If a wolf comes, the shepherd uses his rod to protect the flock. The staff is for training, for direction, for guidance, and also for sustenance. The Lord has the rod to protect us, and He has the staff to train us, to instruct us, to guide us, and to sustain us. We experience the Lord's protection and guiding in the valley of the shadow of death.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_089.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_091.html">Next</a> </body></html>
