   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>11 The Living Creatures in the Air Were Generated</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the fish, the birds, the fowl in the air, were created on the fifth day Gen 1:20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the higher life with the lower consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The bird life is higher than the fish life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Fish can live in the death waters, but birds can transcend them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After you become a fish, you must grow until you are a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When your classmates come to you and say, "Let us go to the movies," you will soar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No one can touch you you will be transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You will not only repel the salt, but you will transcend it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every item mentioned in the first chapter of Genesis has a Bible verse signifying that it is a type.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For instance, the Lord Jesus told Peter that he would be a fisher of men Matt 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By this word, the Lord Jesus likened all people to fish in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Also, we have Isaiah 40:31 which says that they who wait on the Lord shall be as the eagles, soaring and transcending.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a higher life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many can testify that often they were soaring.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can live in any kind of situation, but with a little more growth we not only survive in evil circumstances, we also transcend them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We fly away and nothing can touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A number of times I thought to myself that I would like to be a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then, one day I discovered that I really was a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was an eagle with two big wings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An eagle can mount up and transcend the frustrations of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am not speaking something I don't know or something that is not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Read Isaiah 40:31.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can be the eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the second step of the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is wonderful, but there is still more.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>12 The Living Creatures on the Earth Were Generated</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the sixth day the higher life with the higher consciousness came into existence Gen 1:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This higher life can accomplish something on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 49:9 speaks about the lion, likening Judah to a lion which can do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Samuel 6:7, 12a tells about two kine which were used to carry the cart with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These verses show that both the beasts and the cattle can accomplish something on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their consciousness is higher than the fish, even higher than the bird, and they can do something on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the third step of the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have Christ within us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Starting from the level of the grass, this life will grow from the grass to the herb, from the herb to the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, we will be on another plane, the plane of the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On this level, we will first be a fish, gradually grow to be a bird, and eventually grow even further to be one of the cattle with a life that is higher, stronger, and more meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must recognize the need of light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the first day, we had the light from the Spirit and from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we go on, we need the lights of the fourth day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the fourth day, the lights come from Christ, from the church, and from the shining saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since we are under the enlightening of Christ, the church, and the shining saints, we no longer have only the generating of life but the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The light on the first day is for the generating of life; the lights on the fourth day are for the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The lights on the fourth day mainly come from Christ directly, also from the church and the shining saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are to grow in life after we have received the eternal life, we must firstly contact Christ, secondly contact the church, and thirdly contact the living saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While we are under such a shining, we are in the process of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Regarding this process of growth, I am not speaking about something theoretical.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I know what I am talking about because I myself have passed through all of these stages.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Forty-nine years ago I was a little blade of grass.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then, I grew from the grass to the herb.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Later, I became a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After a certain time, I was a fish, able to live in any of the evil situations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then, I reached a stage in which it was so easy for me to soar in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When there was any trouble or persecution, any hardship or affliction from mother, from brothers in the flesh, from wife or children, even from brothers in the spirit, I simply transcended them all.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is real.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many times your dear wife gives you a hard time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before you become a bird, you will stay there to argue, to exchange words.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once you become an eagle and the dear wife gives you trouble, the eagle-husband will fly away.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This eagle-husband will remain soaring in the air and watching, watching until the wife says, "Praise the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then, the eagle-husband will return.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By your experience you can tell when you were the fish and when you were the eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you haven't had this kind of experience, I can assure you that someday you will be an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The eagle has no struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When any difficulty comes, he soars in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is really hard to catch him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When there is affliction, hardship, or trouble, the eagle takes to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>That is a real victory, a transcending victory.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Don't you want to be such an eagle?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Sometimes, however, when I was an eagle, finding it easy to fly away, the Lord said to me, "Don't fly away.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Stay to be one of the cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You need to be a cow.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Either produce milk to feed others or bear them as a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When your wife gives you a hard time, don't fly away give her some milk.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Feed her and bear her as a burden."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Perhaps your husband or your wife is the death water to you, killing and salty.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you are a tree or an herb, you will certainly be killed, but if you have grown from a plant to a fish, you will live.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the past, I saw many young ones who were so good before they were married.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Once they married, however, they were killed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The young husbands were killed by the young wives and the young wives were killed by the young husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But, I also saw some dear saints who had grown up to be a living fish.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The wives didn't care how salty their husbands were and the husbands didn't care how salty their wives were.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They continued to live.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>After a certain time, they grew from the fish stage to the eagle stage.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Whenever they had some hardship, they simply transcended it.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Gradually, after more growth in life, they realized that flying away was not the higher life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They realized that they needed to stay on earth to produce some milk for their folks and to bear their dear folks as a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When you reach this stage and your dear wife gives you a difficult time, you don't say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You simply put her upon your shoulders and bear her as a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>While your wife is arguing with you, you put her upon your shoulders and tell her, "I am going to bear you to the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In 1 Samuel 6 there is a cart with the Lord's ark.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You are needed to carry part of the weight of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You need to do something, to have some activity upon this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Don't fly away.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The so-called heavenly life is not the highest life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When you become so heavenly, you must return to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Do not simply grow higher and higher, but grow in order to come down.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The Lord Jesus was God, but for the fulfillment of God's purpose He came to the earth to be a cow.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He came to be sacrificed and He came to bear all of our burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Whenever someone persecuted Him, He put that persecutor on His shoulders and said, "I will carry you to the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>What kind of life is this?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Now we can see that every point in the first chapter of Genesis is related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I ask you to bring all of these verses and all the points included in this message to the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>"Lord, I have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But Lord, You know that I need the lights of the fourth day.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I have the light from the first day already, but I need the lights of the fourth day.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Lord Jesus, I need You as the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>I need to contact You directly.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I want to be in Your presence day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I want to be under Your shining.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I also need the church, the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>And I need the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>I need the overcoming saints, the ones who are shining, who turn many to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>I need those who can turn people from darkness to light."</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If you will contact the Lord as the sun, the church as the moon, and some good saints as the shining stars, you will have the lights of the fourth day.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>It is by these lights that you will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The plane of life within you will change from the plant life to the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>You will grow day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Then you will be able to withstand any death situation and be able to transcend every opposition, distraction, or temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Eventually, you will return to earth purposely to do God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>However, this is not the life with the highest consciousness, but the higher life with the higher consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We need to go on to the last part of the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>As we will see in a later message, at the last part of the sixth day comes the life with the highest consciousness, the human life, a life which expresses the image of God and has dominion over all things for God.</S>
