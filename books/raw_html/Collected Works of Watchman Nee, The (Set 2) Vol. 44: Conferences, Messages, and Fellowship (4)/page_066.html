<h2 class="head2">Brother Nee's Testimony&mdash;<br />a Revelation of Crucifixion with Christ</h2><p>In 1927 I was in the upper room in Wen-teh Lane, and the Lord showed me that my crucifixion with Christ was an accomplished fact. Before that time I acknowledged the teaching of our crucifixion with Christ as much as anyone else. I could say as much as anyone else about the reason for our crucifixion with Christ. I could preach as well as anyone else concerning the doctrine of our union with the cross. I cannot deny that I had some experience of crucifixion, but there were problems within me. I saw that there were still many hindrances within. I tried hard to deal with them, but I could not say that I was dead; I was not there yet. I spent four months asking the Lord to show me that I was crucified with Him and to bring me into such a crucifixion. Daily I received some light, but the light was not strong enough. I studied the Bible diligently, and every time I came across the words, "I am crucified with Christ," I repeated them to myself. But I still could not believe them. It was impossible for me to believe them. I prayed every day, and I dropped all my work and tried to deal with this one thing. One day I woke up, and between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning while I was in prayer, I suddenly saw that my death in Christ was something joined to Christ, in the same way that the banknote is joined to the hymnal. My eyes were opened, and these words came to my mind: "There is only one, not two." It was impossible for Christ to die without my dying as well. Has Christ died? Indeed He has! What about me? Immediately I jumped out of my chair and said, "Hallelujah! I have died also!" Just as Christ has died, I have died. Christ is not any more dead than I am, nor is His death any surer than my death. What God has done in Christ He has done in me. Christ has died; therefore, I have also died. Christ resurrected; therefore, I have also resurrected. Christ has ascended; therefore, I have also ascended. I ran down the stairs and met a brother. Grabbing him, I said, "Don't you know that I am dead?" He was bewildered. I said, "Don't you know that Christ is dead?" He said, "I do." I told him, "Just as He died, I have also died." From that day on, I have never denied what I have seen. This is the inheritance we have in Christ. It is not by struggling or striving that we inherit all these things. We must be those who are in Christ before we can share our inheritance with Christ. Some people have made the cross a teaching. But to others, it is a vision and a revelation. Everything God has done has been done in Christ, not in us. When we are in Christ, all these things become ours.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN CHRISTIANS</h2><p>"Christ in the Christian" has to do with what is about to come; it has nothing to do with the past. It has to do with the present and the future. Christ is in us, not for the purpose of dealing with problems, but for the purpose of imparting the power of life to us. When we are in Christ, we enjoy His work and His experience. When Christ is in us, we enjoy His life and Himself.</p><p>Christ is in the believers to live for them and within them. This is the believers' inheritance. Christ does not live in the believers so that they can learn to be like Christ, imitate Him, copy Him, or take Him as their pattern. He is not living in the believers so that they will slowly advance and gradually attain after five or ten years. Paul preached Christ crucified and resurrected, not the believers crucified and resurrected. Believers do not live merely by the power of Christ; rather, Christ lives within the believers by becoming their life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>God has given Christ to the believers to be their life. There is no need for believers to help God by exercising their will, because this fact is a law. Life has its law, and this law is spontaneous; it is not something that one has to work out. The law of the Spirit of life is a natural law. Anything that is unnatural, that comes by struggling, striving, or laboring is not the result of taking Christ as life.</p><p>It is not enough to merely know life. We must know the law of life. A law is something that never changes. Circumstance, experience, and feelings all change, but a law never changes. The law of gravity is the same for everything everywhere; it does not change with time or place. We do not have to worry whether the law of gravity will function; it operates spontaneously. As long as we live according to the law of the Spirit of life, power will come spontaneously. The secret to the Christian life is not to invoke the life of Christ but to allow the life of Christ to invoke us. When we are faced with a problem, all we have to do is say to the Lord, "I cannot do it, but Your life within me can." We do not have to exert extra energy to do anything or believe in anything. This life spontaneously expresses itself. This is God's inheritance for us. God's inheritance is just Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS ALL</h2><p>The wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption spoken of in 1 Corinthians 1:30 are not things but a person. These things all point to a person&mdash;Christ. A Christian is different from a worldly or religious person. A Christian is a person in whom Christ operates; he is a person in whom Christ lives and on whose behalf Christ lives. Those in the world have to struggle using their own energy, but all that a Christian needs is a little faith. The Lord is within us, and He is our sanctification, righteousness, humility, and patience. Christ is everything to the Christian.</p><p>Many people emphasize faith, but their kind of faith is often nothing but a kind of work. Many people pay attention to obedience, but the obedience they talk about is nothing but work. These human endeavors are not the result of Christ's operation within man. On the one hand, we must see that we are in Christ and that all of Christ's past experiences are ours. On the other hand, Christ is in us to be our life and to live for us. All we have to do is believe in a simple way&mdash;this is what Isaac represents. This is enjoyment, and this is inheriting God's inheritance. Thank God that it is of God that we are in Christ and Christ is in us.</p>
