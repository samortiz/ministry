   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING THE HOOFS OF A CALF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now go on to consider the calf s hoofs, a matter of particular importance in the vision recorded in Ezekiel 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being Straight</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all should walk like a calf, having straight hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No Christian should walk on lion s paws.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While we can apply the boldness of a lion to our Christian character, we should not apply the lion s paws to the Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Neither should we walk with the claws of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who walk with the claws of an eagle will eventually hurt others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also, we should not walk with the feet of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man s feet are good, but they are somewhat crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Human cleverness is something crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why Paul said that he did not conduct himself in fleshly wisdom, that is, not in human cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead of being crooked or clever, our Christian walk should be straight and frank.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why Paul tells us not to lie to one another Col 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should never lie to a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To lie is to be crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are able to speak something, speak it honestly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are not able to speak honestly, simply do not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the last days before the Lord Jesus was crucified, He went to Jerusalem and was surrounded by the leaders of religion and politics.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On one occasion, the chief priests and elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching and asked, By what authority do You do these things?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Matt 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In His answer the Lord Jesus said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The baptism of John, from where did it come, from heaven or from men? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>24-25a .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if we say, From men, we fear the crowd, for all hold John as a prophet vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>25b-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this kind of dilemma, they considered that the best answer was a crooked one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, they turned to the Lord Jesus and said, We do not know v. 27a . Actually they did know, but they would not tell.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that they were crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the Lord Jesus, knowing their crookedness, said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things v. 27b . Here we see that whereas the chief priests and the elders were crooked, the Lord Jesus was straight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus feet were calf s hoofs; with Him there was no crookedness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we read the four Gospels, we will see that while the Lord Jesus was on earth, He walked in a very straight way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Step by step His walk was straight.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He walked on the earth with calf s hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We also should walk in this way today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we walk in a crooked way, we should not expect the church to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the church life we all need to learn to be frank, honest, faithful, and sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should be simple and single.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we mean yes, we should say yes; if we mean no, we should say no. Anything more than that is from the devil Matt 5:37 , the father of all lies John 8:44 . One may lie with a good intention, but that lie is still of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not walk according to our crooked man s feet but should walk with calf s hoofs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man s feet are crooked, but calf s hoofs are straight.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only the Lord Jesus was straight in His walk, but also the apostle Paul was very straight, frank, faithful, and honest in his walk.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By reading Paul s Epistles to the Corinthians, we can realize that Paul was a straight and frank person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 1 Corinthians 4:21 he asked, What do you want?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Should I come to you with a rod or in love and a spirit of meekness?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What if one of the Lord s servants should write a letter asking such a question to a church today?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The whole congregation would be shocked.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we would be a faithful servant of the Lord, we must be straight in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Being Cloven</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In addition to being straight, the calf s hoofs are also cloven, or divided.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to Leviticus 11:4-6 any animal that does not have cloven hoofs is not clean.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the clean animals have their hoofs cloven, divided.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Clean animals such as the cow and sheep have two characteristics: the chewing of the cud and the dividing of the hoof.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The divided hoof signifies that in our walk with the Lord we need a proper discernment to divide the right things from the wrong and the clean things from the unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To have a hoof that is not cloven, like that of a camel, is to have a walk without discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As believers in Christ, we need to have such a walk that we can discern what is right and what is wrong in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need this kind of discernment in our daily Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need this discernment also concerning the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this country the term local church has become somewhat popular.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many groups pick up this term and in a loose way call themselves a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we need to be able to discern whether a particular group of believers is in fact a normal, proper, genuine local church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need the cloven hooves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not be careless, thinking that simply because a group says that they are a local church, they must indeed be a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some groups are genuine and others are not.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some are right and some are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some are real and some are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Both in our daily Christian walk and in the church life, we need the cloven hoofs of the calf.</S>
