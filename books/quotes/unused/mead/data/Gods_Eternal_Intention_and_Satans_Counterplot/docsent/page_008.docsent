   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE TWO TREES IN GENESIS AND THE TWO LAWS IN ROMANS Scripture Reading: Gen 2:8-9, 16-17; Rom 7:21-25a; 8:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are many things on this globe which people treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I would like to tell them, however, to throw those things away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have diamonds to give them!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The gospel imparts to us something other than what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It offers us God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Jews believe that they have God, but actually they do not.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God in Christ is the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without Christ we do not know where God is; He cannot be traced.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would like to tell my Jewish friends that what they have is not real.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What I would share with them is real.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This sounds proud, but it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is spoken out of love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I may have come from a nation despised by the western people, but nonetheless I do have something beyond what they have.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>WHY THE LORD CHOSE CHINA</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a private talk with me in 1933, Brother Nee spoke with me about the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After Count Zinzendorf and the Moravian brethren, he said, the Lord unquestionably raised up the Brethren in the 1820s under the leadership of John Nelson Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These British Brethren were much used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before very long, however, they were damaged by division because of their excessive attention to doctrinal considerations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of them, Europe was spoiled for the practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This poison also spoiled the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to Brother Nee's observation, the Lord around 1920 had a need for His recovery to be carried on.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because both Europe and America were no longer pure soil, the Lord was forced to go to a heathen, primitive land.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning the church practice, China was virgin soil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The gospel had been brought there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible was there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord's name was known.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The denominations also, sorry to say, were present; but there was little Brethren practice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sixty years ago China was truly virgin soil in the matter of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This afforded the Lord a new beginning, distinct from the denominational practices and purely according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now sixty years have gone by.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation after revelation has come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not surprising that when Brother Nee's books were translated into English, many seeking Christians were ready to devour them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>New light was there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>New expressions were used.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Remember that the source was the Nazareth of China.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Can anything good come out of Nazareth John 1:46 ?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yes!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That was where Jesus Christ came from!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord has very much opened up Romans 8 to us recently.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For fifty years I have been speaking on Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now it has become a new chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The other day I was looking into Godet's exposition of Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is there is old and general.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is common to a number of seeking Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Where can we find something fresh about the law of the Spirit of life?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>NOT RELIGION, ETHICS, NOR PHILOSOPHY</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Western culture is based upon Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we say that the West is under the influence of the Hebrew religion, we are including Judaism, Catholicism, Greek Orthodoxy, and Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Hebrew religion presents people with God and ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The essence of religion is to behave and teach according to one's beliefs about God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Jews have a belief about God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I do not say they believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I believe in God I am not boasting but my Jewish friends only believe about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They do not really believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In any case, because of their belief, they preach and teach their children about God and try to behave according to what they believe.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The western world, Europe and America, is made up of the descendants of Japheth, one of Noah's three sons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These make up the white race.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are under the influence of the Hebrew religion and its offshoots.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Chinese are under the teachings of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even in their dreams the Chinese people, some nine hundred million of them, are governed by his ethics!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this message what I have to say is beyond the Hebrew religion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It will leave the teachings of Confucius far behind.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The pure revelation of the Scripture levels all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to the revelation of the Bible, I say to the westerners, Forget the Hebrew religion!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To the easterners, Forget Confucius' teachings!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I have a commission and a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Apostle Paul also acted according to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He offended both Greeks and Jews, calling them both fools and stressing that God alone was wise 1 Cor 1:19-27; 2:6-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must come back to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What I have to say is extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you have a Chinese background, as you read, do not entertain the thought that Confucius deals with this point also.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you come from a western background, as you are reading, do not say to yourself, "My pastor said the same thing five years ago!"</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What the Bible teaches is higher and deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Please learn to pick up the God-given discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The focus of what the Bible reveals is other than what Confucius and the Hebrew religion teach.</S>
