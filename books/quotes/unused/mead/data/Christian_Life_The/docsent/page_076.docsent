   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN LIVING AND WALKING BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 5:25; 2:20a; Phil 1:19-21a; Gal 5:16a; Rom 6:4; 8:4; Gal 6:16; Phil 3:16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will consider the matter of living and walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This matter is crucial to the believers and crucial to the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our living and walking by the Spirit include three main things the all-inclusive Spirit, the all-inclusive death of Christ, and the life-releasing and producing resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apparently, according to the letter, these three things have nothing to do with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, however, these three things are compounded into one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit in the New Testament is the compound Spirit, even the compounded Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The compound ointment in Exodus 30 is the best type of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That ointment was not made of only a single ingredient olive oil but was made of olive oil compounded with four kinds of spices.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot see the Spirit, because He is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We also have something within us that is invisible to us our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These two spirits the Spirit and our spirit are both invisible, yet they are more than real.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to our experience, we do have a part within us that the Bible calls our spirit Job 32:8; Prov 20:27; Zech 12:1; Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 16:18; 1 Thes 5:23; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, God is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although we cannot understand this, because we have a spirit, we can realize it by our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Triune God has gone through all the processes in Christ to become the all-inclusive, compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today this Spirit is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Him we have the Triune God, and in Him we also have the uplifted humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the Bible we cannot understand that in the Spirit, who is the divine Spirit, there is the uplifted humanity, the humanity of the highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, in the Spirit there is also Christ's humanity with His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All these items are in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even more, in the Spirit there is Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because this death is not simple, we have called it the all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This death solved the problems and terminated the negative things in the universe, and this death also released the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to realize that in the Spirit we have such a wonderful death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Finally, in this Spirit we also have the life-releasing and producing resurrection of Christ.</S>
