Corinthians 11:2-16 does not speak of believers as brothers and sisters; rather, it speaks of them as men and women
Neither does the matter of head covering have anything to do with the relationship between Christ and His church
Later, when God poured out His Spirit at the time of Pentecost, the believers who were present began to speak in tongues
We must identify the two different systems here before we can understand the two different situations Saul was under
The kings and the leaders of the Israelites belonged to the side of God's government; they maintained the system of God's government
In the new heaven and the new earth, the system of grace and the system of government will join together and become one system
Those who are saved in this age must learn the fundamental lesson of not frustrating God's government with His grace
The system of government is not for the system of grace; rather, the system of grace is here to perfect the system of government
God not only cast them out of the garden of Eden; He also guarded the garden with cherubim so that Adam and Eve could not go back
Although God was merciful to him and brought him to the mount of Pisgah, he could not join the people of God in entering Canaan
God's grace allowed him to see the boundary of the land, but God's government forbade him from entering the land
These verses do not say anything about the relationship between the Father and the Son; that is a relationship in the Godhead
In His government God appoints man to be the head, just as He appoints Christ to be the Head and He appoints Himself to be the Head
Similarly, Christ is the Head of every man in God's government, and man is the head of the woman in God's government
In terms of God's government, Christ did not stand in the position of God the Son, but in the position of the Christ, the One sent by God
He cannot overturn his master's authority or the government's authority just because he has believed in the Lord
Every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved'
The significance of head covering is that one puts himself under God's government; he acknowledges this position
There are many things which one does for himself, but there are also many things which one does as a representative of the whole group
She also covers her head as a representative, because she represents every man, and she also represents Christ
Verse 10 says, 'Therefore the woman ought to have a sign of submission to authority on her head for the sake of the angels'
We are doing this to testify to the angels that have rebelled that we accept Christ as our Head and we accept God as the Head'
When we have the sign of submission on our head, that is, when we cover our head, we are rendering the best testimony to the fallen angels
The problem with some is that either they do not do anything at all or they go to an extreme when they do something
Verse 15 says, 'But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering'
Verse 15 says, 'But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering'
If a sister does not cover her head but instead shaves off her hair, we can say that she is still obeying the Scripture
Verse 6 says that if a woman does not have her hair covered she must be shaved, and that if she is not shaved she must cover her head
Verse 16 says, 'But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God'
In the same way, God being the Head of Christ and Christ being the Head of every man are universal matters, not Corinthian matters
Jewish men and women covered their heads with a head covering called a 'tallith' before entering the synagogue
The custom of the Greeks was that when men and women entered their temple, both uncovered and exposed their heads
No race or country during Paul's time had the custom of men uncovering their heads and women covering their heads
One is that we walk as individuals before God, and the other is that we walk in the capacity of a representative before God
If we treat our servants poorly, we sin as individuals and also as representatives; we have misrepresented the Lord
When Moses was at Meribah in Kadesh, he was angry at the Israelites because they tempted God, and he struck the rock twice
If this had only been a personal matter or an independent act as a leader of Israel, Moses could have been forgiven
A sister has to cover her head as an individual, and she has to cover her head in the position of a representative
