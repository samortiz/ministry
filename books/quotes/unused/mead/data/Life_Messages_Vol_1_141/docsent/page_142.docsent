   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REVELATION ON THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul tells us that God has revealed the mystery of Christ to us in spirit Eph 3:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Ephesians it is the church that is referred to as the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the mystery of God Col 2:2 , since God is embodied in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because Christ is realized in the church, the church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without a revelation in our spirit, we cannot know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are countless Christians to whom the church remains a mystery; they do not know how to look to the Lord through their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The mystery is revealed only in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A PURE HEART AND SINGLE MOTIVE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our heart is like an envelope, containing the spirit 1 Pet 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To have a transparent spirit to see God's revelation, we must have our heart thoroughly dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Lord, purify my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only cleanse it, but purify it from any covering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Make my motive single, that my only concern may be to see You, to see Your recovery, and to see the mystery."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without a pure heart and a single motive, our view of things is foggy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our vision of the church may be like a rainbow, disappearing from sight after a while!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The problem with seeing is not in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The problem has to do with the "envelope" in which our spirit is wrapped.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our heart may not be pure; we may be motivated by hidden desires for rank or status.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Pray that the Lord may do this purifying work in you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then you will be steady in seeing the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mystery of Christ, which is the church, will be revealed to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>SUBTRACTING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christians are not secular, worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As children of God and members of Christ, we must learn to "subtract" how we feel in our mind, emotion, will, and heart and take care of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we are all set to quarrel with a brother, do these four subtractions!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The wish to quarrel will be gone, and the spirit will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not be people in our mind, emotion, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our mind may be shrewd, but subtract it!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our emotions may be strong, but do not live in them!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our will may be set, but turn from it!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever confronts us things great or small, good or bad, right or wrong we need to be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Abide in Me" John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This wonderful "Me" is right in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To abide in Him that is where we must be.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you have moved out, move back in. GOD PLEASED</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is happy when He sees that we remain in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our spirit is our hope.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is our home.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is our country.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no place else we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah for this wonderful home in which we can stay!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we want to please the Lord, we must be sure He always finds us here.</S>
