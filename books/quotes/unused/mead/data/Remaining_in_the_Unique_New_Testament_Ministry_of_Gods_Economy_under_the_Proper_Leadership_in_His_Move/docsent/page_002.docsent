   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Nourished and Blessed</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by Following the Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With Paul and Timothy we see an excellent pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have pointed out, Paul told Timothy to lay these things before the brothers, referring to the things which he was writing in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, before Timothy could lay these things before others, he first had to feed on them himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He had to digest them, assimilate them, and allow them to saturate his inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then he would be able to lay them before the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today we should follow Timothy s example and lay before the saints the things with which we have been nourished by the Lord through the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How wonderful the church life would be if we all did this!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if we turn from the ministry and seek to produce something different, we may give place to differing teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not Timothy s intention to teach anything different from what Paul taught.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, he would lay before the brothers what he had received from Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At this point, I would like to say a word concerning my burden in putting out the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The aim of these messages is to produce groceries for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My burden is not mainly to cook these spiritual groceries; it is to produce them and supply them to the churches that every local church may be a well-stocked supermarket, filled with a variety of nourishing foods.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the leading ones in a local church lay before the saints the riches contained in the Life-studies, the saints will be abundantly nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have received many letters testifying that this has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a fact of history in the Lord s recovery that any church which follows the ministry is strong and blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But those churches which neglect the ministry and try instead to do something on their own have become a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, in saying these things, I wish to make it very clear that I by no means insist that the churches or the saints read the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To repeat, my burden is to produce groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The churches and the saints are free either to use them or to disregard them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if the saints cast away the nourishment found in these messages, I wonder what they will feed on.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we eat the groceries produced in today s religion, we shall be part of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let me say in frankness and honesty that the leading ones need to take these things and lay them before the saints that they may be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Life-study of 1 Timothy, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>70-71, Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>SPEAKING THE SAME THING ACCORDING TO</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE TASTE OF THE LORD S RECOVERY Speaking the Same Thing</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are here for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am not doing my own work, and you are not doing your own work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all are bearing one testimony; we all have our shoulders under the staves of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since we are all bearing the one testimony, we all should speak the same thing 1 Cor 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the speaking in certain places is leading the saints in the direction that is away from the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such speaking may not be wrong or unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It may be right and scriptural, but eventually it will lead the saints in a wrong direction.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we go in a straight line, we shall reach a proper goal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if our direction is off, eventually we shall reach a goal that is not the goal of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even after a short period of time, trouble may come to the recovery through your way of speaking scriptural things, that is, through your speaking of good messages.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although there is nothing wrong with your speaking, it may lead others in a wrong direction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If so, eventually that will become a problem to the whole recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The recovery is not merely a local matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the recovery is in your local church, the recovery is universal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you lead those in your locality in a direction that is off from the recovery, then there will be two directions the direction in the recovery as a whole and the direction in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you teach in a way that leads others in a different direction, some may receive your teaching, but many of those in the Lord s recovery will reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They will not swallow your teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From experience we know that the one who teaches differently is the first one to be sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that if you teach differently, you run the risk not of sacrificing the recovery but of sacrificing yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all need to practice Paul s word to Timothy: Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently 1 Tim 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead of teaching differently, we should all speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since I am the one who has given the Life-study Messages, it is rather awkward for me to speak about them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, I can say that the Lord s recovery has been going on by the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the ministry had not come to this country, the recovery would not be prevailing here.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The recovery came through the ministry, and the recovery has been going on by the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you, then, speak something that is off from the ministry, surely the recovery will not follow that speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is a dream to think that the entire recovery will follow the speaking that is different from that of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, if you speak differently, you will exclude yourself from the recovery by your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No one else will exclude you; you will be excluded by your own speaking, concept, and attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is no doubt true that every local church has its own jurisdiction.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, we have taught very strongly that each local church is not a Body of Christ; all the churches together are the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because of this, what happens in one place will affect other places.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that what you do in your locality will affect the other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>News travels quickly from one place to another.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Also, the saints who are now in your locality later may move to a different locality.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who teach differently are not able to stop the ministry in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The ministry brought the recovery to this country, and the ministry is still carrying the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How can the ministry receive dissenting teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Those who teach differently will cause trouble first to themselves and then to others and to the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They will damage others and then cause damage to the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Such damage is the responsibility of those who teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We all need to consider what we minister, preach, and teach.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This means that we need to take care of all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Before the Lord I can testify that this was my practice in China, and it is my practice today.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When I was in China speaking in a certain locality, I considered how the other churches might be affected by my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I asked myself, Will this cause trouble to the other churches?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>How will it affect them?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Will the entire recovery be able to accept this?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I realized that if I did not consider my speaking in this way, I could cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I could speak something that the recovery as a whole would not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I could speak something that others would reject because it was contrary to their taste.</S>
