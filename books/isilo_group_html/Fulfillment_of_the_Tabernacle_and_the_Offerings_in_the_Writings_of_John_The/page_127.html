This Gospel is a record of signs. Every chapter in this book contains certain signs. These signs may be simple, but they are very rich in their implications. For example, a street sign may have a simple appearance, but what it indicates may nevertheless be very important.<p>When John wrote his Gospel he followed the principle of writing down certain signs. In 20:30 and 31 John said, &#8220;Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.&#8221; The very last verse of the Gospel of John says, &#8220;And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books written&#8221; (21:25). This verse, together with 20:30-31, affirms that this Gospel is the record of a selection of things that serve a particular purpose.<p>It is impossible to exhaust in writing the things done by the Lord Jesus. Knowing this, John selected certain of the Lord&#8217;s doings and arranged them in a record that is significant not only historically but also doctrinally. For instance, John placed the record of foot-washing in chapter thirteen, not in chapter eleven.<p>We have pointed out that the sequence of events in the Gospel of John is for the formation of a doctrinal frame. Chapter one is a prologue to the entire Gospel, and in chapter two we have the principle of life and the goal of life. Then in chapters three through eleven we have nine cases. The issue, the outcome, of these nine cases is the miniature of the church life seen in Bethany. In Bethany there was the feasting on the peace offering.<p>The church life portrayed by the feasting in Bethany was marvelous, but it was too limited. It was excellent in quality, but it was much too small in quantity. Therefore, it was necessary for the Lord Jesus to die in order for this kind of church life to be multiplied. For this reason, the Lord was not willing to receive the exaltation of the crowd, but instead told His disciples that He was a grain of wheat to fall into the ground and die in order to produce many grains (12:24). As the unique grain, the Lord is the source of the church life. But it was necessary for this grain to be multiplied into many grains. Because the Lord fell into the ground and died, many have been drawn to Him. This was the reason He said, &#8220;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself (12:32). John 12 reveals that the Lord Jesus was ready to die in order to bring His people into God.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED OF THE LAVER</h2><p>In chapter thirteen we have the record of foot-washing. In 13:10 the Lord Jesus said to Peter, &#8220;He who is bathed has no need, except to wash his feet, but is wholly clean.&#8221; God&#8217;s redeemed, saved, and regenerated people have all been &#8220;bathed,&#8221; or cleansed. Nevertheless, they are still on earth and by contact with the earth are defiled again and again. Hence, there is the need of the laver. If there were no laver, the earthly contact would annul the wonderful result of Christ being all the offerings. Therefore, there is the need of washing to preserve, to maintain, the result of Christ being the offerings to us.<p>We may use cooking and serving food as an illustration. A sister may prepare an excellent meal for her family. However, if she is careless, something may come in to defile the food that has been prepared. Knowing this, the sister will do what is necessary to preserve the food she has prepared. The washing in the laver preserves what has been accomplished by Christ being the offerings. Earthly contact may not be sinful, but it defiles the result of Christ&#8217;s wonderful work. Because of the need to preserve this result, there is the need of the laver. According to the arrangement in the Old Testament, the laver stood between the altar and the tabernacle.<p>If we study the Gospel of John with a spiritual view, we shall realize that chapters one through twelve show us all the offerings. We may say that these chapters reveal different aspects of the all-inclusive Christ, and that these aspects are related to the offerings. Therefore, in these chapters the offerings are fulfilled. John 1:29 says, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; and 3:14 says, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&#8221; Both of these verses point to Christ as the offerings.<p>In chapters fourteen through seventeen of John&#8217;s Gospel we have the tabernacle. Chapter thirteen is a turning point, a link between chapters one through twelve and chapters fourteen through seventeen. Chapters one through twelve are at the altar, and chapters fourteen through seventeen are in the tabernacle. Between these sections we have chapter thirteen as a connection and turning point. In this chapter we have the laver, which is located between the altar and the tabernacle.<p>Comparatively speaking, the laver is not as important as the altar or the tabernacle. The laver can be compared to a small part in a large machine. Although the machine is large and the part is small, the machine cannot function properly without it. The principle is the same with the laver in relation to the altar and the tabernacle.<p>The offerings are on the altar, and in the tabernacle are many riches: the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark. Although the laver contains only water, it should not be neglected. If we neglect the laver, we shall not be able to enter into the tabernacle, for what was accomplished at the altar would be annulled because of defilement. If we are defiled through earthly contact, we shall not be allowed to enter into the dwelling place of the clean and holy God. Whoever comes into the tabernacle must be clean in every way-physically, psychologically, spiritually, and morally. Those who enter the tabernacle must be clean in spirit, soul, and body. Only when we are thoroughly clean are we qualified to enter the Holy Place, the sanctuary. If we see this, we shall realize that foot-washing is crucial.<p>Among certain Christians today, even the altar has been polluted because there is no laver. According to what we have pointed out concerning the laver in previous messages, the laver is altogether lacking. Because there is no laver and the altar has been polluted, there is absolutely nothing of the tabernacle. This is today&#8217;s situation. We thank the Lord that, in His recovery, we have the Holy Place, at least to some extent. We enjoy the church life portrayed by the miniature in Bethany. This means that in the church life we are feasting with the Lord, with the incarnated God.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_126.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_128.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 127</div><br></body></html>
