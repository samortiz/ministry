   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHOEVER WANTING TO BECOME GREAT SHALL BE THE SERVANT, AND WHOEVER WANTING TO BE FIRST SHALL BE THE SLAVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord uses the phrase among you three times.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today the Lord is establishing authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who are great in the church, that is, those who are established by the Lord as great ones, are actually the servants and slaves of all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whoever wants to become great shall be the servant of all, and whoever wants to be the first shall be the slave of all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we see the two great requirements for a man to be appointed as God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, there is the need to drink the cup obedience to God's will absolutely and to accept the baptism acknowledgment of death for the release of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, there should not be any ambition for power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One should only be a servant, a slave of all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, one should have a spiritual basis; he should honor God's will as the central and highest thing among all things and should release the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the other hand, one has to be humble, which means having no interest in being the authority among the brothers and sisters and being satisfied with being a servant and a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God can only use such people as His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All those who are willing to be servants will be appointed by the Lord as the great ones, and they will be entrusted with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All those who are willing to be the slaves, that is, who have a heart to serve the brothers and sisters, will be appointed to be the first by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, a man must have a spiritual foundation on the one hand, and have a proper attitude and view towards authority on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He must not have any craving for authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only men such as this can be God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have laid out these two points in an honest way before you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do not possess the first point a spiritual foundation, it will do you no good to possess the second humility.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You still will be useless even if you become very humble.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord answered James and John, He first dealt with the first criterion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, this does not mean that a person will be given the right or left side of the Lord after he has a spiritual foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord said that it would be given to whoever God wills.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the first qualification, there is the need for the second condition, which is being a servant and a slave among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who fulfill these two conditions, who see themselves as unsuitable and incapable men, are the ones who are qualified to be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord is after those who consider themselves unqualified men, servants, and slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord said that such ones can be made the great ones and the first.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to be an authority, one has to drink the cup and take the baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Otherwise, all is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in addition to this, he has to be truly humble, considering himself worthy to be only a servant not in word only, but in inward feeling .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord said that such a one can be great.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are afraid of the kind of humility that stays on one's lips only.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Humility must be something that issues from the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to be a deputy authority, we must fulfill the condition of spirituality as well as the condition of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The qualification of an authority is based on one's consciousness of his inability and unsuitability.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One thing is sure: None of the persons that God used in the Old and New Testaments were proud.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I can tell you frankly that as soon as a person becomes proud, God will put him aside.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a worker for over twenty years, I have never seen a proud man who was used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if a man is just a little proud in private, his words will sooner or later expose him, because a person's words always disclose the hidden state of his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even a humble person will be greatly surprised at the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The surprise that awaits the proud, however, will surely be many times more than that of the humble!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must be conscious of our unprofitableness all the time, because God can only use the unprofitable slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are not saying this to be polite.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We honestly should feel that we are unprofitable slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may have tended sheep or plowed the field, but when we come in from the field, we should still acknowledge that we are unprofitable slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should always stand in the position of a slave Luke 17:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God never entrusts His authority to the self-confident and self-assured.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to reject pride and learn humility and meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not speak for ourselves but should learn to know ourselves and to see things from God's viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Finally the Lord said, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many" Mark 10:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord did not come to be an authority but to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The less ambition a man has and the more he humbles himself before the Lord, the more useful he is in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more a man thinks highly of himself and the more he thinks he is different from others, the less he is useful in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord took the form of a slave and became a slave to all.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He never seized any authority; all of His authority came from God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord was raised from a lowly place to the height.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is His principle.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not try to seize any fleshly authority with fleshly hands.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should be the servants of all.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then when God commits certain responsibilities to us, we will learn to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The basis of authority is ministry, and there is ministry only where there is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When one has a ministry, he has a service, and when he has a service, he has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>May the Lord deliver us from haughty thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A man who tries to usurp God's authority with his fleshly hands will suffer severe judgment!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to fear authority as much as we fear hell fire.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is not an easy matter to represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is too great a matter, something unfathomable to man, and something that we dare not touch with our own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should take a straight course in obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our way is the way of obedience, not the way of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is a matter of being a servant, not a matter of being great.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is a matter of being a slave, not a matter of being the first.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Moses and David were great authorities, yet neither of them built up their own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This should be the way of those who serve as authorities today.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should tremble with fear in our exercise of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
