   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONDITION OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In summary, a believer must understand all the laws of the spirit before he can walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If he is not watchful, and does not cooperate with God, he will become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The most important law of the spirit is to examine the condition of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An examination of the condition of the spirit is the central issue that we have spoken about in the above discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A believer should understand the condition of his own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He should know the normal condition of the spirit and when the spirit has lost its normalcy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The spirit should rule over man's soul and body; it should have the highest preeminence and be the most powerful part.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A believer should check to see if this is indeed the condition of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He should know if his spirit has lost its normalcy and is being agitated through warfare or the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are generally four kinds of conditions with the spirit:</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1 The spirit is oppressed and suffers a setback.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 The spirit is calm, steady, and in the proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3 The spirit is agitated and forced to overreact.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>4 The spirit is defiled and has become sick 2 Cor 7:1 ; it has given ground to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A believer must at least know these four conditions of his spirit, and he must know how to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many times through his own carelessness or through the attacks of the enemy, a believer's spirit is "pushed aside," and becomes depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At such times, he loses his heavenly, bright, and victorious position and becomes cold, crippled, and flattened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The spirit can become depressed through sorrow or a hundred other reasons, losing its soaring joy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the spirit is oppressed, it falls below the line of normalcy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes the spirit can also be agitated and moved beyond its proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A believer can be excited in the soul and become ecstatic to the extent that his spirit is agitated and loses its calmness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes a believer follows the "creaturely vigor" to the extent that he has an "unrestrained spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Uncontrollable laughter and many other reasons can cause the spirit to become wild and uncontrollable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Prolonged warfare with the enemy can also result in overactivity of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Satan can cause a believer's spirit to become overstretched during or after Satan's conflict with him to the extent that he cannot stop his spirit's activity and hold his composure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Satan can give believers a strange kind of happiness or many other things that cause their spirit to act beyond the control of their mind or will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When this happens, believers are no longer able to guard themselves, and they fail.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes, the spirit is neither too high nor too low, but it is defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes the defilement appears as an attitude in one's spirit like stubbornness and disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes it appears as sins in the spirit like pride and jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At still other times, it appears as a mixture of soulish activities in the spirit like natural love, feelings, and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once the spirit is defiled, it has to be cleansed 2 Cor 7:1; 1 John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a believer desires to walk according to the spirit, he must understand his spirit's condition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is his spirit in a calm and proper condition, or is it in a position that is too low, too high, or defiled?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He should know how to uplift his suppressed spirit so that it will match the standard of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He should know how to exercise his will to stop the hyperactive spirit and turn it back to its normal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He should know how to cleanse his defiled spirit so that he can once again work with God.</S>
