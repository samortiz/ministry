   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Finding Rest in the Soul</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we take the Lord s yoke and learn of Him, we will find rest in our souls.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Matthew 11:28 the Lord sounded out a call: Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The toil mentioned here refers not only to the toil of striving to keep the commandment of the law and religious regulations but also to the toil of struggling to be successful in any work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whoever toils is always heavily burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rest refers not only to being set free from the toil and burden under the law, religion, or any work or responsibility but also refers to perfect peace and full satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we take the Lord s yoke and learn from Him, we will find rest for our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is an inward rest; it is not something outward in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus always submitted to the Father s will, taking God s will as His portion without resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, He was always at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must learn from Him and take this view.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do, we will have rest in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we struggle for a high position, we will not find rest, but if we are meek and content to remain in a lowly state, nothing can disturb us, and we will enjoy Christ s rest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the believers are conformed to the death of Christ, they are released, freed from many negative matters, to enter into the Holy of Holies, their spirit, to see God and consider Him, thus to receive His infusion, saturation, and filling so that they may become the corporate reproduction of God s firstborn Son for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is made possible in the blood of Jesus and through a new and living way initiated by the rending of the veil, which signifies the flesh of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The rent veil also implies that the old man of the believers was crucified with Christ, giving them a way to enter into the spirit to contact and enjoy God as their life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The believers, entering into the Holy of Holies, come forward to the throne of grace within the veil to receive mercy and grace from the ascended Christ who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today the believers spirit is the Holy of Holies, the dwelling place of God; it is the gate of heaven with Christ as the heavenly ladder joining the believers to heaven and bringing heaven to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By exercising our spirit, we can enter into the Holy of Holies to touch the throne of grace, which is Christ as the propitiation place and the great High Priest who sympathizes with us in our weaknesses, so that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This should be our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The believers also enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by following Jesus, following Him in His steps.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In following Jesus we must not pay attention to others but must go outside the camp, that is, go outside of the human organization of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To go outside the camp, we must first enter within the veil to be strengthened and encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By entering the spirit, within the veil, we taste the sweetness of the heavenly Christ, we are filled with the glory of the heavenly Christ in our spirit, and we are released in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This enables us to go forth outside the camp unto Jesus, being freed from the possession of the earth s enjoyment, bearing His reproach, and taking the pathway of the cross on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not need to endeavor to imitate Christ outwardly; rather, by experiencing the all-inclusive Spirit and the riches of the divine life, we become His reproduction, enabling us to follow in His steps.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Holy of Holies enables us to take the pathway of the cross, and the pathway of the cross leads us into the kingdom in its manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The believers also enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by taking the Lord s yoke and learning from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To take the Lord s yoke is to take the will of God and to be restricted by it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This requires us to be in the meekness and the lowliness of the Lord s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way we find rest in our souls.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are content to remain in a lowly state and not disturbed by any matter or thing, we enjoy Christ s rest.</S>
