Hidden within this temptation of the Lord Jesus, there was leaven.…When we eat bread, we may not realize that we are also eating leaven, for leaven is hidden in the bread and thus is invisible. Although no one could see the leaven hidden in the temptation presented by the Pharisees and Sadducees, it was nonetheless concealed within it.</p><p>As we have seen, chapter fifteen deals with the matter of eating. From 15:1 through 16:12, Matthew’s record is very much concerned with eating. Eating unclean things may defile us (15:1-20). What we need is not the outward washing, but the inward eating. Eating is the way to partake of Christ (15:21-28), and eating causes Gentile dogs to become children of God, even proper men. By eating we feed on the unlimited and inexhaustibly rich supply of Christ (15:32-39). Matthew 15 concludes with the record of corporate eating. However, we must beware of eating leaven (16:5-12), especially the religious leaven hidden within religious people, such as the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The Pharisees were the ancient fundamentalists, and the Sadducees were the ancient modernists. I am thankful that the Bible mentions them both. In today’s religion there are also fundamentalists and modernists. The first group, the fundamentalists, have sound, scriptural beliefs. The second group, the Sadducees, deny what the Bible says.</p><p>In Christianity religious people…always have some leaven. Under the cloak of religion, they bring in certain matters that corrupt and damage the things of God. Therefore, we must learn to beware of leaven as we are enjoying Christ as our heavenly bread.…We need to realize that leaven may often be concealed under the cloak of religious teachings.… [Moreover], those who bring in leaven desire to see signs, miracles.…In 16:1-12 the two key words are sign and leaven. The Pharisees and Sadducees…asked…[the Lord Jesus] to show them a sign from heaven. [But] in speaking of the sign of Jonah [v. 4], the Lord seemed to be saying, “You…do not need miracles.…You need to…repent…and…believe that I will die for your sins and be resurrected to impart Myself into you as life. This is the sign for this generation. No other sign will be given. I am the sign to you, the sign of the crucified and resurrected Christ.…”…Every miracle, every sign, must be based upon the principle of the crucifixion and the resurrection.…Otherwise, the miracles will simply be a type of leaven.

The teaching of the Pharisees was hypocritical (23:13, 15, 23, 25, 27, 29), and the teaching of the Sadducees, which denied the resurrection, angels, and spirits (Acts 23:8), was like today’s modernism. Hence, both the teaching of the Pharisees and the teaching of the Sadducees were impure and evil and were likened to leaven, which was not to be seen among God’s people (Exo. 13:7).</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 555-561; Hymns: #541</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
