<h2 class="head2">Work in Ch'ang-sha and Hankow</h2><h2 class="head3">Ch'ang-sha</h2><p>We are on the sixth day of the conference. Probably there will be two or three days more of meetings. Many unsaved ones have come and joined us. The Lord willing, we hope to have two or three days of gospel meetings after this so that we will not owe the unsaved ones anything. Although man is weak and corrupt, God works apart from man and gains men for Himself. I can only praise Him with all my heart.</p><p>Sister Tso Fu-ru,<br />August 13</p><h2 class="head3">Hankow</h2><p>Thank and praise the Lord! He has preserved us and allowed us to meet in peace for a week. The conference ended last night. We studied Revelation in the mornings, and in the evenings we preached the way to love the Lord or the practice of loving the Lord. The attendance in the morning was less, about twenty, than in the evenings, about forty. The brothers and sisters received much help. The day before yesterday three brothers (Lee Jung-ming, Chu Chi-cheng, and Huang Da-gan) were baptized.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi, August 16</p><h2 class="head2">News of Co-workers in Yunnan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Sister Ruth in the Lord:</p><p>I set out to work in south Yunnan for the second time on August 19. I worked in Mong-Tze for about ten days. If the Lord intends for me to work here, I will need my own place to stay. On the morning of August 29, I took the train to work in Lin-An and lodged at the house of Brother Chou Je-min, the superintendent of the state hospital of Yunnan province. Recently, he has become clear concerning the truth of salvation and has become quite seeking. Another sister, Kuo, who is a nurse, is in the same condition as Brother Chou. Both have been baptized into the name of the Lord recently. The Lord has also opened the door of the gospel in Lin-An. If any brother has a leading from the Lord, it would be wonderful to see him stay here for a few months. I have written a letter to Brother Tsing-yuen. I wonder when the Lord will grant him the leading to go. The saints in Shi-Ping have received much help from the work of Sisters Yu and Lee. Even some sinners were saved. After the sisters finished their work in Shi-Ping, they went on to work in Lin-An for a while. I met them at Mong-Tze. I heard that they have now returned to Shanghai via Hong Kong.</p><p>The church in Ku-Jiu is wavering because of the sickness of one of its leading brothers and because of outside influence. I intend to visit the brothers and sisters in Ku-Jiu after my work here. There is one more brother in Ku-Jiu, Mr. Lin Kwang-hwa (the eldest son of Lin Yau-huei), who is working in the aluminum factory. The church in K'un-ming will move its address to [omitted]. You can find brother Hwang Chung if you go to the meeting hall, because the janitor can lead you to his house. Between Kai-Yuen and Bi-She-Chai Station, there is a place called Dah-Juang Station. Recently, the Lord arranged for a sister, Mrs. Ma, to move there. Her husband indicated that he wanted to believe in the Lord while he was in K'un-ming. (Both of them were Muslims.) I intend to preach the gospel there after I finish my work in Ku-Jiu. Mr. Ma is the general director of Pioneering Farm. He said that he can introduce me to the workers of the farm to preach the gospel to them. Peace to you in the Lord! Greetings to Sisters Chang and Wang and to all the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</p><p>Kwang-hsi, September 1</p>
