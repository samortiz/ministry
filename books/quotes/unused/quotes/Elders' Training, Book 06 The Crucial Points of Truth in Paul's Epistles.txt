The messages contained in this book were released during an elders' training in Anaheim, California from September 23 through 28, 1985
We should still meet at the same time on the same day, but before we go to any meetings we need to get ourselves prepared
If you are not one who fellowships with the Lord every day, regardless of how much you pray, your prayer may not work
When you pray as one who fellowships with the Lord all the time, though, there will be an echo and that echo is the Lord's leading
The best way is not to go through a book of the Bible verse by verse or to read the Life-study Message from the first line to the last line
The saints should be encouraged to experience and enjoy this crucial point day by day and hour after hour during the week
Many times in the past the saints gave testimonies merely of their experiences with seemingly nothing related to the Word
If we practiced in this way for one year, helping the saints to get into one crucial point a week, the result would be marvelous
There is a need for us to find out the real denotation or significance of certain crucial words used in God's holy Word
If you were to cover all the crucial points in 1 Corinthians in this way, this book would become transparent and clear to all the saints
You only received 'the raw groceries' from the Life-studies, but you did not know how to cook the Life-studies in a proper way
Based upon the foundation that John Wesley laid, the Methodist denomination used to use the Bible to the uttermost
Among all the churches of the Pentecostal movement, the one with the greatest number of members is the Assembly of God
We can use the notes of the Recovery Version plus the Life-study Messages in order to dive into the crucial points of the Scriptures
Some of the brothers can testify that when they preach the gospel using the high, deeper truths, they have been warmly welcomed
If you were to pick up the crucial points from the book of 1 Corinthians, you would be occupied with this book at least sixteen weeks
We need to talk to the children, to our parents, to our relatives, neighbors, and colleagues concerning these crucial points of the truth
May the Lord grace us all to take the way of labor to get into the crucial points of the truth in the divine revelation
The central message of the book of Romans is that sinful, fleshly people are made sons of God and conformed to the image of the Son of God
In order to get into this crucial point, you need to spend much time to study, using the Life-study Messages on the book of Romans
We need to tell people that the gospel is a matter of a Person who has a double nature-the human nature and the divine nature
For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith: as it is written, But the just shall live by faith'
There is no power in the law because the law has only man's righteousness, but in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed
Christ as the righteousness of God is given to us, so the power of the gospel of God is actually Christ as the righteousness of God
Paul presented God in the way of pointing out God's eternal power and God's personal characteristics expressed in His creation
Anyone who looks at the universe scientifically and objectively can realize that the universe itself indicates a certain extraordinary power
It would be helpful to study some science to find out something concerning the light in Genesis 1 to help you in the preaching of the gospel
Genesis 1 also mentions the 'fourth-day lights' such as the light of the sun, the light of the moon, and the light of the stars
God created all the luminaries such as the sun, moon, and stars so He is the Father, the source, of the luminaries, the lights
Light, beauty, and life are a few of the many characteristics or attributes of God which show how marvelous He is
God gave the outward law to the Jews, so the Jews have to behave and act before God according to the God-given, outward law
The Jews are under the law condemned by God, and the Gentiles are also condemned before God according to their conscience
When the conscience accuses you it means that you are wrong, and when it excuses you it means that you are right
You have to labor on such a crucial point with the help of the notes in the Recovery Version and Life-study Messages
Romans 4:17 says, ' before the God whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being'
In Romans 4, however, we see justification by faith in the One who gives life to the dead and who calls not being as being
When we believe in the Lord Jesus we are justified by the very God who gives life and who calls not being as being
In the past we only saw that when we were justified by God He forgave us of all our sins and reconciled us back to Himself
We never thought that justification involved the new creation being called into being and the divine life given to us
If we walk according to the spirit, the righteous requirements of the law will be fulfilled and we will be led as the sons of God
Mankind was created according to God, and because God is good, there is a natural law within man always trying to do good
The satanic life is the satanic law, the divine life is the divine law, and the natural life is the natural law
We became fallen and received the satanic life and nature into our being and with this satanic life is the satanic law
The Spirit is given to us as a foretaste of the full taste of this inheritance which is the Triune God Himself given to us for our enjoyment
For us, the many brothers of God's firstborn Son, to be conformed to His image, we need to enjoy the Spirit as the firstfruit
The issue of the enjoyment of the Spirit as the foretaste is the redemption of our body, which is the full sonship
The consummation of transformation is conformation; transformation results in conformation, and conformation issues from transformation
Romans 8:19 says, 'For the anxious watching of the creation eagerly expects the revelation of the sons of God'
Someday we sons of God will be revealed to the entire universe, especially to the angels and mankind and the demons
When our full sonship comes, we will be glorified and that glory will set the entire creation free from the bondage of slavery
By studying these verses along with the Life-study Messages, you will get a clear picture of God's selection in His mercy
Romans 9:16 tells us that 'it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy'
Our concept is that the one who wills will get what he wills to get and that the one who runs will gain what he runs after
If we do know God's mercy, we will not put our trust in our efforts; neither will we be disappointed by our failure
Romans 9:20-24 says that man was made a vessel and that this vessel is a vessel to honor because God is contained in this vessel
We were predestinated by His sovereignty to be His containers, vessels to honor to express what He is in glory
Romans 10:12 and 13 say, 'For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him
Now we are enjoying Christ as the fatness, the riches, of this divine organism for God to dispense Himself into our being
Verse 17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
In Matthew 5 those who hunger and thirst for righteousness and those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness are blessed
Matthew 5 also tells us that we are blessed when others reproach and persecute us, and that when this happens we are to rejoice and be glad
All of the saints in the churches will then speak the same thing in their homes, schools, offices, and everywhere
To pick up the crucial points in the New Testament books is the way for us to uplift the standard of the truth in the Lord's recovery
In such a message there are many points, but the readers, including you and me, are too used to picking up only the convenient points
It would be marvelous if our young people who are even twelve years of age would be able to speak these crucial points
In God's economy we have been put into this portion, and God has made this portion our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
In chapter three, both the growth of the plant life and the transformation of the minerals are for God's building
The building of God, the house of God, the church, is the increase of Christ, the enlargement of Christ in His unlimitedness
In the church God transforms us from the plant life into minerals, which is fully illustrated by the petrification of wood into stone
The apostles considered themselves as criminals doomed to death before the world, not as kings destined to reign
In 4:13 Paul said, 'Being defamed we appeal; we have become as the offscouring of the world, as the scum of all things until now'
The entire Christian life should be such a feast, such an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet, the rich supply of life
In chapter six the crucial point is being joined to the Lord as one spirit that our body may be the temple of the Holy Spirit
The crucial thing in these few verses is that our being joined to the Lord as one spirit is so that we could be the temple of God
For your body to be a temple of the Holy Spirit means that your union with the Lord as one spirit affects your body in a positive sense
In the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles, and they become one with Him; thus they both speak together
He continues in verses 24 through 27: 'Do you not know that those who run in a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?
Everyone who contends exercises selfcontrol in all things those therefore that they may receive a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible
The reward which the Lord will award His overcoming saints who win the race, is something in addition to salvation
The manna must therefore also be Christ and the living water must be the very Spirit that comes out of Christ, the cleft rock
Today we enjoy the Lord's table, where the manna is the bread on the table and the spiritual drink is in the cup on the table
In all of these verses are many good points which are defined either in the footnotes of the Recovery Version or in the Life-study Messages
At the Lord's table we receive His body and blood for our enjoyment; at the Lord's supper we give Him our remembrance for His enjoyment
In discerning the Body of Christ we should not partake of the bread in any division or with any divisive spirit
Our participation in the Lord's table must be the unique fellowship of His unique Body without any division either in practice or in spirit
The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues, do not require any growth in life
The baptism into the one Body has positioned us all to drink, and by drinking of the Spirit we are constituted to be the Body
The primary denotation of the word prophesy in chapter fourteen is not to predict but to speak a particular word concerning Christ
He is our Passover , the unleavened bread , the spiritual food, and the spiritual rock flowing out the spiritual drink
The life-giving Spirit is the totality of all the other foregoing items, and we have to experience this life-giving Spirit in our spirit
A number of things are covered in chapter sixteen but the crucial point is in verse 18: 'For they refreshed my spirit and yours
If we are faithful, after a few years all the truths which we present will become so common to many of the Lord's children
All the saints will speak these truths very commonly, and they will never be so hidden or so hard to understand
Verse 15 says, 'For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing'
Two figures of speech are used; one is the celebration of a victory, and the other is the scattering of the incense in the celebration
As he was traveling in his ministry, he considered that he was a captive and that his ministry was a procession celebrating Christ's victory
The phrases 'unto death' and 'unto life' in 2:16 refer to the different effects of the apostles' ministry upon different persons
All believers of Christ should be such a living letter of Christ, that others may read and know Christ in their being
The Spirit of the living God is the ink the element the essence of the writing conveying Christ as the alphabet the sentences and the words
The New Testament ministry here is called the ministry of the Spirit , the ministry in glory , and the ministry of righteousness
The ministry of the old covenant became one of death because the old covenant brought in condemnation unto death and death unto condemnation
The same image means we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is
God's shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything
According to the context, the apostle's speaking by the spirit of faith was related to the death and resurrection of Christ
A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing this screen
In this aspect He was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we may become the righteousness of God in Him
There are a number of points in chapters six through ten, but these points should not be considered as crucial
Paul said that they were 'super,' not higher, and that what they taught may become another husband to the Corinthians
In verse 2 Paul said, 'I know a man in Christ,' and in verse 9 he said, 'And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you'
Rather it is like that of the Lord Jesus, who when He was arrested, brought to Golgotha, and put on the cross, did not do anything to resist
In verse 5 Paul mentioned his weaknesses, and in verse 9 he again said that he would rather boast in his weaknesses
The Lord, in order to train us as a man in Christ to enjoy Himself as the all-inclusive Christ, surely needs to subdue us
The next crucial point is found in 13:4 which says, 'For indeed He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God'
Verse 4 continues, 'For indeed we are weak in Him, but we shall live together with Him by the power of God toward you'
Now we pray to God that you do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do what is good, and we may be as disapproved'
Among the Corinthians, some may have admired Peter as a giant, and others may have admired Apollos as a learned one
When he said this, he actually was asking them to test themselves whether they were in the faith related to knowing the apostles
Apparently in verse 5 he did not ask the Corinthians to test themselves concerning knowing the apostles, but concerning knowing themselves
If they would have considered themselves not by faith and not in faith, they may have said that Christ was not in them
Just as they should have considered themselves in the faith, so also they should have done the same concerning the apostles
If you would consider him by faith, you would realize that he is powerful, not in himself but in the One who is in him
If they would not have tested themselves in the way of faith, they would have concluded that they were in the flesh
It would have seemed to them that they were not in Christ, that they had nothing to do with Christ, and that Christ was not in them
They considered that Christ was in them, even though according to their appearance they were natural men in the flesh
Whenever we feel that we are strong and see the signs of our strength, we are through with the enjoyment of the grace of Christ
Chapter thirteen verse 14 says The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all
Our attachment to the anointed One is altogether due to the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
If the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are with us, then we can be such captives and incense-bearers
To be such a letter continually speaking Christ, and to be such a mirror beholding Christ, we must be in this divine benediction
While the Lord Jesus was on this earth, the Jewish religion was exposed to the uttermost that it was an evil age
If the Jewish religion had not been such an evil age, how could its leaders have put the Lord Jesus on the cross?
God's heart's desire is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life , and become the sons of God
The Judaizers bewitched the Galatians so that they considered the ordinances of the law above the Son of the living God
The apostle, in the opening of this Epistle, testified that he had been deeply involved and far advanced in that realm
God, however, had rescued him out of that course of the world, which was evil in God's eyes, by revealing His Son in him
God's revealing of His Son to us is in us, not outwardly but inwardly: not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing
To such ones Paul 'yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might remain with you'
We have to spend some time to pick up all the related points to be able to present this item of the gospel to others as basic knowledge
The word truth in these verses does not mean the doctrine or teaching of the gospel; it denotes the reality of the gospel
Although Galatians is a short book, it affords us a complete revelation of the reality of the gospel in certain basic principles
You need to spend some time to study and to make an outline of this portion of the Word related to the truth of the gospel
Verse 23 says, 'But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was about to be revealed'
Until faith came, the law was our child conductor, guardian, escort, custodian, used by God to watch over His chosen people
John 3:14-16 says, 'Even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life
For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life'
Faith has two denotations: objective faith referring to the things we believe in and subjective faith referring to our believing act
Whosoever would repent and believe in Christ would be forgiven, reconciled, justified, and regenerated to have eternal life
When you are showing the scenery by the Word, the Holy Spirit works with the Word not only as the power but also as the light
As the audience listens to and hears the Word, the scenery is there and the Holy Spirit as the power and the light is also there
The faith in Galatians and in the other books of the New Testament equals the economy, the household administration, the dispensation of God
Even if you were to regret believing and were to decide not to believe anymore, this faith would still be in you
The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ
The Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God's bountiful supply for us to enjoy
Is another crucial point, that is, we have been baptized into Christ, and as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ
In Galatians 1 Christ is revealed in us , in chapter two Christ is living in us , and in chapter four Christ is being formed in us
Hagar, the concubine of Abraham, symbolizes the old covenant, and Sarah, the wife of Abraham, symbolizes the new covenant
Verse 4 says, 'You have been brought to naught from Christ, you who are justified by law; you have fallen from grace'
Verse 6 says, 'For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith operating through love'
The crucial point in these three verses is that we may be brought to nothing from Christ and that we may also fall from grace
To go back to the law is to become severed from Christ, to be brought to naught from Christ, which is to fall from grace
They may say that since you have fallen from grace, you have lost grace, meaning that you have lost your salvation
Again this crucial point has been fully and adequately covered in the footnotes of the Recovery Version and the Galatians Lifestudy Messages
You must pay your full attention to the footnotes in the Recovery Version and the Life-study Messages on these verses
The Greek word for walk in verse 25, stoicheo, denotes an official walk, a walk to carry out a certain commission
In the second walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step, whereas in the first kind of walk we are free to walk about
To sow unto the flesh is to sow for the flesh, with the purpose of the flesh in view, fulfilling what the flesh covets
To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires
You have to sow, which means you have to behave, act, do things, and work, all the time with the Spirit as a view, as a goal to reach
If in all things you sow by the Spirit, along with the Spirit, and unto the Spirit, you will reap the Spirit as your harvest
Because of the background of today's situation we have stressed again and again that the grace of our Lord Jesus is in our spirit
God's blessings to the church are comprised of the Father's being and doing, the Son's being and doing, and the Spirit's being and doing
The Son's redemption is also to bring forth the sonship, and the Spirit's sealing and pledging are for the purpose of sonship
In God's view we were all raised up together, just as all the Israelites were raised up together from the death waters of the Red Sea
The heavenlies not only indicates the heavenly place, but also the heavenly nature, state, characteristic, and atmosphere
We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are also a poem, expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design
We, the church, as the masterpiece of God's work, are an absolutely new item in the universe, a new invention by God
Christ broke down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances
When Christ died on the cross, He not only dealt with sins, the old man, Satan, and the world; He also dealt with the ordinances
By His death on the cross, Christ dealt with five categories of things: sins, the old man, Satan, the world, and the ordinances
In Ephesians 2:20-22 is the revelation of the building in two aspects-the universal aspect and the local aspect
In verse 21 we see the universal aspect of the church: 'All the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord'
In verse 22 we have the local aspect: 'You also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit'
The prayer in chapter three also ends with the church as an issue of our experience of Christ making His home in our hearts
In chapter one the church is the fullness of the One Who fills all in all and in chapter three the church is the fullness of God
There is much material for you to study in the footnotes of the Recovery Version and in the Life-study Messages of Ephesians
The first three can be grouped together, the Spirit with the Body as His expression, and the Body related to the one hope
The third of the Trinity is mentioned first because the main concern here is the Body, and the Spirit is the essence of the Body
Those' were first the redeemed saints who were taken captive by Satan before they were saved by Christ's death and resurrection
In His ascension, Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself
Through Christs ascension many captives were made gifted persons whom Christ gave to His church as the gifts for the building up of His Body
Ephesians 4:30 says, 'And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption'
The transfiguration of our body will not be an accident but a result of our being saturated with the Spirit by His sealing of us inwardly
For this crucial point we also need to use the entire context of verse 30, namely, verses 25-32, to tell people what can grieve the Spirit
As grace and truth are the basic elements in 4:17-32, so love and light are the basic elements in the apostle's exhortation in 5:1-33
After we have, in the Lord, received God as grace and realized Him as truth, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light
In studying this crucial point it will also help you to refer to the Life-study Messages and to note 53 in 1 John 1
Christ and the church being one spirit as typified by the husband and wife being one flesh, are the great mystery
On the positive side, the church is portrayed in many ways in the first five chapters of Ephesians to fulfill God's eternal purpose
We have to love the Lord according to Christ's resurrection which made us alive, resurrected us, and seated us in the heavens
When some Christian groups wanted to raise money they put out a list of those who gave with the ones giving the most at the top of the list
What we do in our spirit under the heavenly rule to please solely our Father must not be interfered with by our flesh lusting for mans glory
In Matthew 6:4 the Lord says that our alms should be in secret, and our Father who sees in secret shall repay us
The organization and some of the practices of the denominations are corruptible things, since they are something of the old creation
We should not love the Lord in corruption; we should love Him in a pure way, in the way of incorruption that could stand forever
Paul concluded his Epistle according to its contents because whatever is revealed in his Epistle to the Ephesians is incorruptible
For the proper church life we need to love the Lord in incorruption, that is, in a condition which is incorruptible
According to verses 20 and 21, this bountiful supply is for the believers to live Christ and to magnify Christ
Ephesians 4:23 says that we need to be renewed in the spirit of our mind, and Romans 12:2 says, 'Be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
We do not merely follow Christ's steps outwardly, but we let Christ's living mind be in us inwardly to transform us
Christ was humble, and spontaneously we will be the same, because He will be the mind acting and living in us to transform us
God here is not simply God the Father, but rather is the processed Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
It is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit who operate in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure
When we let the living mind of Christ be in us, we live a life that is a mingled life, and we will experience the Triune God operating in us
The third crucial point in chapter two is found in verses 15 and 16 which tell us that we are to hold forth the word of life as luminaries
If we let Christ's living mind be in us doing His transforming work, then we can experience the Triune God operating in us
Christ Himself stressed that He would build His church not upon Himself as the rock but upon the revelation concerning Him
When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, Christ was there, having passed through all the major steps, perfected, completed, and consummated in full
For this knowledge which he treasured he counted everything as refuse dregs rubbish filth which is thrown to the dogs the dog food or dung
To know Christ here is by experience-to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him
Philippians 3:21 speaks of the transfiguration of our body, the conformation of our body to the body of Christ's glory
When we experience Him in our body that will be the consummation of the experience of Christ the transfiguration the redemption of our body
In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God'
A life full of forbearance but without anxiety was the subject of messages 56 through 62 of the Life-study of Philippians
By the empowering of Christ we can live a contented life and be true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of
We experience Christ consummately in chapter three in that our body will be transfigured, conformed to the glorious form of His body
That man was made in the image of God means that he was made in the form of love, light, holiness, and righteousness
Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, that the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Christ in a bodily form
The fact that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that it dwells in Him in a way that is both real and practical
In 2:6 and 7 Paul says, 'As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him'
All these items of the ceremonial law are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come
Verse 20 says, 'If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why as living in the world do you subject yourself to ordinances'
The elements of the world are the ordinances, primarily the Jewish ordinances, but also the ordinances of the Greeks
Because our life has been hidden with Christ in God, who is in the heavens, we should no longer care for things on the earth
The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us so that it may operate and minister the riches of Christ into our inner being
The crucial point in chapter four, the last crucial point of the entire book, is to pray for the door to be opened for the word
If you have ever studied 1 and 2 Thessalonians with adequate attention, you could see it is hard to separate these two books
We do find, however, some very crucial points in Paul's Epistles to the Thessalonians concerning the Christian life
We have to realize that all the early apostles, including Paul, thought the Lord would come back in their time
According to 1 Thessalonians 4, Paul received a revelation that the Savior would not come back as fast as they had expected
Relating to living a sanctified life, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4 says, 'For this is the will of God, your sanctification
The second crucial point in these Epistles is at the end of 1 Thessalonians 5-a spiritual life for our full sanctification
As Christians we should abstain, stay away, and even escape, not only from evil, but also from the form, the appearance, of evil
For a male to talk with a female alone in a private, dark room is not sinning, but there is a form of evil there
If you keep peeling off the skin of peaches for half an hour, though, eventually one peach will get into your stomach
That goal is His salvation, and His salvation is in two things: in the Spirit and in the belief, the faith, of the truth
God's salvation as a whole includes salvation from eternal perdition and also a daily salvation from many things
God's salvation also includes a salvation to come that will save us from the great tribulation of three and a half years
The more we see the truth, the more the reality is revealed in the New Testament, the more we enjoy sanctification
When we pray with the rich Word, the profound Word, the high Word, we will surely be sanctified with something solid
The more we would pray over the twenty-one crucial points of the truth in the book of Romans, the more we would enjoy the sanctification
When the light brings the scenery to the film within the camera, both the seeing and the scenery become subjective to it
In light of the judgment seat we need to be in fear and trembling that we would delay the saints or veil them in any way
The Lord may ask us at the judgment seat, 'as a leader in the church were you taking the veils away from My people?
There will be a photograph impressed upon their spirit and this will become their property, their possession, for them to enjoy
Paul's purpose in writing 2 Timothy was to inoculate the church against decline, degradation, and deterioration
The dispensation of God is a matter in faith, that is, in the sphere and element of faith, in God through Christ
From God's economy in faith we come to 2:4, which says that God desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth
In these verses the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the manifestation of God in the flesh
To minister Christ to others first requires ourselves to be nourished with the words of life concerning Christ
Having been nourished with Christ, we shall then have Christ as the food, the life-supply, the nourishing words, to minister to others
From within we should be nourished with Christ, and then we should have a living which is the expression of God
In 6:3 there are two kinds of words: the words of the Lord Jesus which are the healthy words and the teaching according to godliness
When the Lord's words of life are taught, particularly in certain aspects, they become the teaching according to godliness
The living words of the Lord always bring forth godliness-a life that lives Christ and expresses God in Christ
A man of God is one who partakes of God's life and nature , thus being one with Him in His life and nature and thereby expressing Him
Paul was not an apostle according to letters, or ordinances, or ordination, but according to the promise of life
The gift that the Lord had given to Timothy, according to the context of 1 and 2 Timothy, was probably the teaching gift
Verse 6 refers to the gift of God, the spiritual ability, and verse 7 tells us what God has given-a spirit of power, love, and a sober mind
The Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches
The word in 4:2 is the word of the Bible, comprised of what Timothy learned both of Paul and of the Old Testament
In caring for a local church, especially in a time of the church's decline, the preaching of the word is vital
Even eating and drinking may be at certain times, but breathing is in season and out of season because it must take place all the time
We have the full right to claim that the Lord has to do spiritual things, divine things, and heavenly things for us
You have to join, or combine this point with fanning the teaching spirit into flame and being empowered in the grace
Timothy, which gives instruction on how to confront the degradation of the church, strongly stresses our spirit
The washing of regeneration the renewing of the Holy Spirit the grace the heirs and the hope of eternal life all comprise a crucial point
Whenever we talk about God's salvation, we generally would not think of the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit
It is altogether a matter that transpires in our spirit to make our dead spirit alive by the divine life imparted into it
The divine life coming into our spirit to make our dead spirit alive washes away the dead things, the dead elements
God has saved us, yet this saving is still going on because it is a saving through the washing, which is continued by the renewing
In ancient Rome, a child had to grow up to a certain age, probably twenty-one, so that he would be qualified and equipped to be the heir
We become heirs according to the hope of eternal life, which we have gained and by which we became children of God
When you are enrolled in graduate school, your being enrolled brings you a hope to graduate from graduate school
When you were regenerated you received eternal life, and this eternal life brings you a hope that you may become an heir
Glorification will be our graduation, and this means that we have to be renewed, which is another term for being transformed
The renewing of the Holy Spirit is the transforming work of the Spirit to transform us into His image, from glory to glory
Although many Christians love the world and are indulging in worldly pleasures, they think they will be glorified automatically
When we were regenerated, we were restored in our spirit, and God put Himself within us as the renewing Spirit
In the semisavage age of Paul the life of Christ had annulled, among the believers, the strong institution of slavery
It is of the Lord's sovereignty that this Epistle was positioned after the three preceding books in the arrangement of the New Testament
Whatever He is speaks God, and the entire book of Hebrews is the Son's speaking of God or God speaking in the Son
If we did not have Hebrews in the Bible, we might think that the Son's speaking stopped when He ascended to heaven
Hebrews and Revelation were the two main books of the seven books which were not recognized as part of the divine revelation until A
325, and by that time Hebrews and Revelation, which both refer to God's speaking in Son in the heavens, were not yet recognized as Scripture
397 that these two books with the other five were fully recognized to complete the twenty-seven books of our present New Testament
Without Hebrews and Revelation it would be hard for us to know anything concerning the speaking of God in Son in the heavens
The foundation, which is the word of the beginning of the Christ, is firstly repentance from dead works and then faith toward God
The word of the beginning of the Christ also involves the teaching of baptisms, including water baptism and Spirit baptism
Specifically, baptisms here refer to the washings of utensils and vessels used in the tabernacle or temple for God's service
Hebrews 6:1 indicates that this is not needed; verse 4 says that it is not possible; and verses 7 and 8 show that it is not right
Any word concerning Christ's earthly ministry is the word of the beginning of the Christ in the kindergarten stage
Among all the different theologies, according to my study, only the theology of the Brethren has opened up the dispensations
In Hebrews we are told that now in the heavens Christ is the heavenly Minister and He is also the heavenly High Priest
We would only know the speaking of God in Son concerning His earthly ministry which is only in the kindergarten stage
He was made a little inferior to the angels, yet He destroyed the Devil and He was glorified, crowned with glory and honor
He also produced many brothers or many sons in addition to Himself as the firstborn Son of God, and He made them a church
In chapter five the crucial point is that the One in whom God speaks is the heavenly High Priest, much higher than Aaron as the high priest
Aaron's priesthood was according to the order of Aaron, but this One's priesthood is according to the order of Melchisedec
The order of Aaron was temporary, but the order of Melchisedec is eternal, so His priesthood is much superior to that of Aaron
The crucial point in chapter six is concerning the good word of God as a part of the genuine enjoyment of the New Testament
Whatever is in chapter six as the enjoyment of the New Testament bequests as the blessing of the gospel is in the 'kindergarten stage'
Now He is the heavenly Minister according to this New Testament, and He is executing all the bequests of this new will
His offering of Himself on the cross is an eternal sacrifice offered by the eternal Spirit, so it bears an eternal efficacy
Chapter ten tells us that this One in whom God speaks replaces all the offerings of the Old Testament according to God's will
For this reason we should not forsake assembling together that we may exhort one another to go on to enjoy Him in His heavenly ministry
Since we have seen all that Christ is in His heavenly ministry and we have the way to go on, we have to run the race
