<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Perfecting Ones<br>of This Kind of Christian Perfection<br>Being the Gifted Persons</H2><P>The perfecting ones of this kind of Christian perfection are the gifted persons, such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers (Eph. 4:11-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Apostles</H2><P>The apostles define the truths for the establishing of the church. With James there was a shortage of the truth of God's New Testament economy. James did not realize four pairs of things. First, God has two testaments: the Old and the New. Second, God has two parts of His economy: the Old Testament dispensation and the New Testament dispensation. These should not be mixed up. Third, God has two peoples: the Old Testament people, Israel, and the New Testament people, the church. Fourth, a regenerated person has two men: the old man and the new man. James's writing mixed up these four pairs of things. Actually, he needed a proper apostle to define the truths to him, to perfect him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Prophets</H2><P>The prophets prophesy for the building up of the church (1 Cor. 14:3-5). Proper prophets prophesy the divine word, not mainly to predict but mainly to speak forth the Lord. This is what Isaiah did when he spoke concerning a virgin bringing forth a child whose name is the Mighty God and the Eternal Father (9:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Evangelists</H2><P>The evangelists preach the gospel to make sinners the members of Christ for His Body. They preach the gospel not for soul-winning but for Christ's member-winning. They win sinners to make them the members of Christ for His Body, not to gain souls for them to go to heaven.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Shepherds</H2><P>The shepherds feed the young believers that they may grow up for the building of the Body of Christ (John 21:15-17; Eph. 4:15-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Teachers</H2><P>The teachers teach the believers for their edification to establish the churches (cf. 1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17).</P>
