   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN BECOMING A USEFUL VESSEL IN THE LORD'S HAND 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is crucial for anyone who is truly saved, loves the Lord, and desires to serve the Lord all his life to know how to become a useful vessel in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are a few things that such a one should pay attention to and practice every day for his entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>PURSUING THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First of all, we have to pursue the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both our salvation and our growth hinge on life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Similarly, being useful in the Lord's hand also hinges on life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being able to render help to others depends on life, and being fruitful in gospel preaching also depends on life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Take our knocking on doors house by house as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can see that whether or not it is effective hinges entirely on life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is one thing for a sloppily dressed person to go door-knocking; it is another thing for a well-mannered person to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It would be a tremendous thing if the president of a nation were to go door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the value of the same thing varies according to the person who does it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the apostle Paul were preaching the gospel of forgiveness here today, it would be very weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we were to do it, however, the result would be very different because we are not as advanced in life as Paul was.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we must pay attention to the pursuit of life and seek to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all know that the growth in life of all living things in nature, such as flowers, grass, trees, and all kinds of animals, is a moment-by-moment and day-by-day matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The blood circulation in our body, which is the basis of our growth, is continuous and exceedingly fast.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once there was a brother in the church who was a doctor and who opened a gospel clinic next to meeting hall number three in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was greatly used by the Lord to lead many to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He told me that even before a person finishes speaking a sentence, his blood has already circulated one time throughout his whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person grows in life day by day, and even when he reaches one hundred years old, he will still be growing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible tells us that the life span of all the patriarchs was very long.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For instance, Adam lived to nine hundred thirty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moreover, the entire time that he was alive, he was growing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, the first thing that you must pay attention to is life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In all the books published by us, the matter spoken of and stressed the most is also life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must spend time to study two of these books, namely, The Knowledge of Life and The Experience of Life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BEING EQUIPPED IN THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, according to the Bible, truth goes together with life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Truth is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not our words but the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father, saying, "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth" v. 17 . The Bible is an extraordinary book.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Four Books and Five Classics, written by the ancient Chinese sages, may be considered the highest books aside from the Bible in terms of human ethics and morality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to my evaluation, the philosophies of other countries, such as Egypt, Babylon, and ancient Greece are inferior when compared with the classical writings of Chinese Confusianism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even so, the Four Books and Five Classics are not the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this universe only the word of God is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason, we should never stop pursuing God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our pursuit should be a daily matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I dare not say that it is moment-by-moment pursuit, but at least it must be a day-by-day pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You need to pursue the truth every day in order to gain the knowledge of the truth.</S>
