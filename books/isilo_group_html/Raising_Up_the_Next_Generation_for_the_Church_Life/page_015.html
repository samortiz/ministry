<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE AGE WE ARE IN<br />
AND THE PRESENT REVELATION OF GOD</h2>
<p>We all need to know what age we are in, what the present revelation is from God, where we should be, what we should do, and what flow we should enter into. Time is short, and the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is approaching. We must no longer be drugged by the religious things. We need to wake up to see where we should be and what we should do. This is a serious matter. The Lord Jesus likened this age to the age of Noah, saying, &ldquo;Just as the days of Noah were, so will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage...until the flood came and took all away&rdquo; (Matt. 24:37-39). We must not be here unclear, drugged, and befuddled by the present situation. We must see what the age is, where we should be, and the way we should follow. (<em>The Testimony of Jesus,</em> p. 32)</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ONE WHO KNOWS THE AGE</h2>
<p>We must be those who know the age. If we truly know the Bible, we will be able to see what kind of age we are in according to the prophecies in the Bible and the world situation today. When I was first saved more than sixty years ago, I loved the Bible very much and studied the Bible diligently. At that time some books concerning prophecy had been published in Europe, so I bought some and read them. There are many prophecies related to the world situation, especially prophecies regarding the Jews, the Middle East, and the Persian Gulf nations. These prophecies speak mainly about two matters. The first matter is the restoration of the Jewish nation, and the second matter is the return of Jerusalem into the hands of the Jews.

<p>We cannot continue to work as we have in the past; we must change our ways. In the past we neglected the work with the children, the young people, and the sisters. We highly regarded a general work, but we paid little attention to the young people&rsquo;s work, and we merely prayed for the children&rsquo;s work. Now we must concentrate our efforts on the children, the young people, and the sisters. Moreover, the messages we give must minister Christ as the Spirit in a simple and direct way. We should focus on these primary matters and nothing else. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 270)</p>

<p>When I returned to Taiwan ten years ago, I was very clear, saying, &ldquo;Your eyes have to be open. Do not be too busy outwardly. You should work on the young people, the junior highers, and the high schoolers. You should also work on the children until each week there are at least ten thousand children being taught by us. Those who are six or seven years old now will be high schoolers in ten years. If you are willing to do this, you can definitely succeed.&rdquo; The brothers told me at that time that there were twenty-three thousand names on the list of the church in Taipei, comprising at least eight thousand homes. If each family has one or two children, there should be twelve thousand children. When they asked me concerning a place for the children to meet, I said, &ldquo;There is no need to go to the meeting hall, and it is not necessary to meet on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. You can meet on Saturdays or in the evenings. You can simply meet in the homes of the brothers and sisters. Out of the eight thousand families, you can choose three to four hundred homes to be the places for the children&rsquo;s meetings, with each home holding thirty children. If you continue in this work, you will see how much you can accomplish!&rdquo; Starting from 1966 and 1967 I have been talking about this very matter and have been expecting the church to practice it, because we do have the basic strength to work it out. If we had worked from that time until now, 1977, ten thousand children would have become high schoolers of sixteen to seventeen years of age. Immediately, there would be ten thousand &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; in different high schools. At that time, I also said that we had to work on the junior highers, the high schoolers, and the college students to gain several thousand in each category. In this way, the number of children and young people added together would be at least twenty to thirty thousand. Moreover, children increase endlessly. When these ten thousand get into high school, another ten thousand will take their place. It is a pity that you did not practice what I said! (<em>The Ultimate Significance of the Golden Lampstand,</em> pp. 55-56)</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>The first matter for the sisters&rsquo; service is the children&rsquo;s work. Concerning the children&rsquo;s work, within me there is truly a heavy burden. All the churches must have a children&rsquo;s work. According to statistics, forty-five percent of the population of Taiwan is under fifteen years of age. This is roughly six million people. Many local churches have quite a few families with children. I estimate that there are about ten thousand children in the church in Taipei and about the same number of children in the churches in the rest of Taiwan. If we work with these twenty thousand children, they will all be young brothers and sisters after six to seven years. This is what the sisters should do.</p>
<p>In the past the church in Taipei did not pay adequate attention to this. Of the ten thousand children in Taipei, only about five hundred come to the meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day; eight to nine thousand children are without any care. In spite of all the effort we use to preach the gospel in Taipei, we may not be able to bring three or even two thousand people to salvation in a year. If we cultivate our ten thousand children, they will all become young brothers and sisters in six or seven years. This means that we will have an average increase of a thousand people every year. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, pp. 304-305)</p>

<p>Some may think that it is easy to care for the children who are between the ages of five and twelve by simply giving them a piece of candy. However, to handle the children in this way will not yield a good result. According to my observation, the most difficult work to do effectively is the children&rsquo;s work.
