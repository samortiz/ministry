   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Mr.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Austin-Sparks is a servant much used by the Lord today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most precious truth to him is "in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The turning point in his life came when the Lord opened his eyes to see the riches in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He showed him that he was a rich man living in poverty, that he had forgotten about the riches in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brothers and sisters, this is one gate we have to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>May the Lord open our eyes through the spirit of wisdom and revelation to see the oneness we have with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, after we have seen the oneness we have with the Lord, does this mean that we will no longer lose our temper or that we will never be jealous again?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Does it mean that we will have meekness and love from that point on?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The devil will be like the Canaanites; he will block and stumble us all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not stand firm in the victory of Christ, we will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All those who have not passed the gate of faith will never be able to walk the way of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once God has opened our eyes, we will see the riches in Christ, and the devil will come and tempt, saying, "You say that all the blessings are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why then are you still losing your temper and steaming with wrath?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You say that all the blessings are yours.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Which one do you now have?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The revelation you have received is not real; it is just cheating you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You say that God has given you the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why then is the wall of Jericho so high and the gate shut so tight?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can the seven tribes of Canaan be driven out?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All that God has said is false and in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Maybe you should return to the east side of Jordan."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But crossing the Jordan without encircling Jericho is like entering the gate of faith without walking on the way of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Crossing the Jordan without encircling Jericho will never bring down the walls of Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Entering the gate of faith without walking on the way of faith will never result in any spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The spiritual experience of every Christian is built on the footprints of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Satan will never easily loosen his grip on the things we possess.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have heard that everything is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But after a little while, Satan will say, "You do not have love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You do not have meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nothing is yours."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Are we going to say, "Since these are not mine, I will just go home?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No, we should not say that.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, we should be like a property owner, claiming our property based on our title deed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should walk east, west, south, and north all over our land and manage it according to our title deed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no need to beg or dispute; just take out the title deed and announce it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This title deed is a sealed document; it has an official seal on it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan can do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When temptation comes, we should apply the appropriate verses to withstand the temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If it is a matter of temper, we should take care of it with the verses that deal with temper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If it is love that we need, we should apply verses that speak about love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once we find the right verse, we should declare, "God said that this is my property.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, this is my property."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can tell Satan that he is a liar and that he should go away.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By faith we should say, "By the grace of Christ, I can be patient and meek."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What should go away is our temper, not our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What should be removed is the mountain, not our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Faith should not bow down and surrender; the temper should bow down and surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Faith does not have to move; the mountain has to move.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we stand by faith, no city will be too high for us to bring down.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Did the Israelites fight with dozens of wooden staffs?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No, they did not need even one wooden staff.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They circled the city and went home.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then they circled the city again and went home.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They continued this for six days.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To the inhabitants of Jericho, this must have been child's play.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, on the seventh day, having circled the city seven times, the Israelites cried with faith, believing that Jericho would surely fall down, and Jericho did indeed fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some Christians have crossed the gate of faith but have not walked the way of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They may say, "Oh, my temper, my jealousy, my pride, and my lust are still here.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What should I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At this point please remember that first you must see the riches you have in Christ this is the gate through which you enter into faith.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After the gate, you need to stand firm in your position.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When temper comes, you withstand it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When lust comes, you withstand it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When jealousy comes, you withstand it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When pride comes, you withstand it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You should stand firm and declare, "All these should fall down," and they will fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hallelujah, this is a fact!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Israelites encircled Jericho, shouting and believing that the city would certainly fall down.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How foolish this was from man's view.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But just as Jericho fell at the Israelites' shouting, so will our temper, lust, pride, and jealousy fall at our shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To cross the gate is to see that everything is in Christ; this is the first step of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You need to lay hold of everything in Christ in the same way that you lay hold of a title deed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is the devil's work to tell you that once you lose your temper you are done, and your "title deed" is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Colossians 3:3 says, "For you died."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God has shown you that you are dead; you can no longer lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you believe this, then you have entered the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Satan will come at once, perhaps through your wife, daughter, a student, or someone else, and cause you to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Immediately, you will think, "Perhaps the words for you died' are not a fact to me."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you trust in your feeling, your faith will immediately disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Suppose my father has bought a piece of land and has given me the title deed.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He has told me to go to a certain place to locate the land and manage it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Suppose I come to the countryside and encounter a ruffian, who asks me, "Sir, what are you doing here?"</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I say, "I have come to look for my father's land."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Suppose he says, "How could this be your father's land?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is my father's land!"</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If I think that my father's word is not dependable and that it is the other man's land, I will go home.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But if I say, "No, my father cannot be wrong; according to the title deed, the land is mine," he will have to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Either I go or he goes; one has to go.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God has given you the blessings in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Bible is the "title deed" that God has given to administer the property.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is the "title deed" by which you can exercise your ownership.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When you believe in the Bible, Satan will have to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Unfortunately for many people, when a little temptation from Satan comes, they toss away God's word and lose their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is not enough to receive God's word once; we must stand firm on His word every time we are tempted.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is to walk on the way of faith.</S>
