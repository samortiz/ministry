   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE REBELLION OF THE ANGELS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God created the angels with a free will, and God also created man with a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the angels and man had been created without a free will, the Son would not be able to gain any glory, because anything which is dead has no meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the angels and man, who were endowed with a free will, had allowed the Son to be the Head, the Son would have gained the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet the angels rebelled, man fell, and God s eternal plan was frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s original intention was to express the glory of Christ through all things and particularly through man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of the angels rebellion and man s fall, God s plan was frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE LORD S RELATIONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>WITH THE ANGELS AND WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to God s ordination, the Lord took on the form of an angel before His incarnation, and He took on the form of a man after incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Old Testament He was the Messenger of God Gen 22:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament He was made in the likeness of men Phil 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord took on the form of an angel temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He took on the form of an angel for the purpose of revealing Himself to man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the Lord has also taken on the form of a man eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the New Testament the Lord not only took on the form of a man but also became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the Lord s relationship with man is much more intimate than His relationship with the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hebrews 2:16 says that God did not give help to the angels but to man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In God s plan the Son is joined with man, not with angels.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps the angels are quite aware of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE ORIGIN OF SATAN Ezekiel 28:11-19</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation 12:4 tells us that when Satan rebelled against God, one third of the angels went with him and joined his rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word Satan in Greek means the opposer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How did Satan become Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How did he rebel against God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the history of his rebellion?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can find the facts about Satan in Ezekiel 28:11-19 and in Isaiah 14:12-20.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These passages show us how he was created, his original position before God, his beauty, his latter rebellion, and his ultimate fate.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ezekiel 25 uses seventeen verses to describe the destruction of four kingdoms Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Between verses 26:1 and 28:19, there are seventy-six verses that describe one kingdom Tyre.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is because the king of Tyre in 28:12 is a type of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the Bible places special emphasis on this kingdom and its king.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the adjectives used in verse 28:12 are superlative in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was full of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This wisdom was probably used originally to understand God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, Satan had the function of a prophet before his fall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 13 says, Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Eden referred to here is different from the Eden spoken of in Genesis 2:8.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This Eden denotes God s dwelling place in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The precious stones denote God s light, and gold signifies God s glory; Satan had both.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In comparing the precious stones that covered him and the stones that covered Aaron, we see that God had probably appointed him to be a priest cf.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Exo 25:7; 28:9-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ezekiel 28:13 continues, The workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Pipes require breath to produce sound.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, they signify life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Tabrets move the heart and express love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The tabrets and pipes signify God s delight.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Musical instruments are always linked to the kings 1 Sam 16:23; Isa 14:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This shows that he was a king.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These three things reveal that Satan functioned as a prophet, priest, and king at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created means that he belonged to the previous world, distinguishing him from the prince of Tyre in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 14 says, Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word anointed means that he was separated for God s commission.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Covereth refers to the covering of the ark, the place where God s righteousness signified by the blood and God s glory signified by God s appearance are found.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The cherub s duty is to lead men to worship the Lord Rev 4:9-10; 5:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was the one commissioned by God to lead the created hosts to worship God s righteousness and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This again shows his priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 14 continues, I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the Bible mountains signify an administrative center.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The great mountain in Daniel 2:35 typifies God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The mountains in Revelation refer to God s administration centers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this verse we are told that Satan was in the seat of God s administration and ruled over all things of that world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The stones of fire refer to God s light.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This shows that he had intimate fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to Ezekiel 1:26, the cherubim are positioned under God s throne.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is confirmed by the picture in Exodus 24:10 and 17.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This means that he was very close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Ezekiel 28:15 says, Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everything that God creates is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Verse 15 continues, Till iniquity was found in thee.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The word till indicates a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God did not create a Satan; He created a cherub.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After God s created cherub fell, he became Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The iniquity he committed brought sin into the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Verse 16 says, By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Mr. Pember said that the word merchandise can be translated as slander.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The word devil in the original language means the accuser Rev 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Satan s way of merchandising is to bribe men s hearts with little gifts and favors, as Absalom did.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The word profane can also be translated overstepping.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It means going beyond one s rightful place.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As a result God cast him out and stripped him of his rule.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The phrase O covering cherub reminded him of his name.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>And I will destroy thee, O covering Cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This means that the fellowship was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But this does not mean that Satan could no longer go to God; it merely means that spiritual fellowship was terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Being cast out from the holy mountain denotes being stripped of his administrative post and the fact that he could no longer rule the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Being destroyed from the midst of the stones of fire refers to being stripped of the spiritual fellowship and the fact that he could no longer come near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Verse 17 says, Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He became proud because of his beauty, and he overstepped his boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He also corrupted his wisdom by reason of his brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As a result he was cast to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Originally his sphere was the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Now it is limited to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Verse 17 continues, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>These kings were the angels who ruled the world together with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But only one-third followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Those angels who did not follow him still rule the universe, and they are the kings referred to in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Psalm 82 shows us that there are many rulers in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Ezekiel 28:18 says, Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is the punishment of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The first world was destroyed by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Verse 19 says, All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>After this verse the description switches back to the prince of Tyre spoken of in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Isaiah 14:12-20</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Isaiah 14:12-20 also gives us some facts about Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Verses 12 through 14 describe his past, while verses 15 through 20 tell us his present condition.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Verse 12 says, How you have fallen from heaven, / O Daystar, son of the dawn!</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>/ How you have been hewn down to earth, / You who made nations fall prostrate!</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Daystar refers to the morning stars mentioned in Job 38:7.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The phrase son of the dawn refers to the fact that he was the first one created in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Verses 13 and 14 say, But you, you said in your heart: / I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>/ And I will sit upon the mount of assembly / On the sides of the north.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>/ I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will be like the Most High.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>He said I will five times.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This was the cause of his fall.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This was not just a matter of the heart but a matter of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The heaven in verse 13 is different from the heaven in verse 12.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The heaven in verse 12 is in contrast to earth, whereas the heaven in verse 13 is above the heights of the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This is God s administrative center, the place where God conducts His business.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Satan s goal is to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>He was higher than all the archangels already Jude 9 , yet he was not satisfied with this.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>He wanted to be equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Genesis 1:1-2 speaks of God s judgment on the world at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>When one-third of the angels rebelled with Satan, there was a change in the universe, and God executed great judgment upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Genesis 1:1 says, In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Heaven includes not only heaven but also the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>After God judged the rebellious Satan, the earth became without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>The first world that God created was good Job 38:7; Isa 45:18 , because God is not a God of confusion 1 Cor 14:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Yet the earth became without form and void through God s judgment Jer 4:23-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The Bible shows us that the earth is the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>In the future, everything will happen on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We can say that the earth is the center stage of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>GOD S PERMISSIVE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Due to Satan s rebellion, the earth has become marred with sin, and heaven is also tainted with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>According to Leviticus 16:14-15, when the priests offered the sin offering for the propitiation of sin, they had to bring the blood into the Holy of Holies and sprinkle it before the propitiation cover.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Hebrews 9:24-26 tells us that Christ has entered the tabernacle not made with hands, the heavenly tabernacle, and has offered up Himself as the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>According to Colossians 1:20, the extent of propitiation or redemption is not limited to the earth; it includes heaven as well.</S>
