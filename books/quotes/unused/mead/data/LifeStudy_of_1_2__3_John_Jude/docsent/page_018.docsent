   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE SIX CONDITIONS OF THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP 1 Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:5-7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing messages we have considered two mysteries the mystery of the divine life and the mystery of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we have not covered these matters thoroughly, I believe that they have been somewhat opened to us and that we have at least received hints concerning how to delve into them further.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall begin to consider the conditions of the divine fellowship, that is, the terms that must be fulfilled in order to enjoy this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we would be in the divine fellowship, we need to fulfill certain conditions, terms, or obligations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only then can we enjoy the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This matter of the conditions of the divine fellowship is revealed in the second half of chapter one and in the first half of chapter two 1:5 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only two verses speak of the divine life 1:1-2 and another two verses of the divine fellowship 1:3-4 , whereas seventeen verses are related to the conditions of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that, as far as we are concerned, the conditions of the fellowship are a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The divine life and the divine fellowship are both on God s side.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the conditions, the terms, the obligations, by which we can enjoy the divine fellowship are on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is simple to receive the divine life and to be brought into the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But it is not a simple matter to maintain this fellowship and remain in it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, the apostle John does not pass over the conditions that must be fulfilled if we are to remain in the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we shall see, there are two main conditions covered in 1:5 2:11: the confessing of sins 1:5 2:2 and the loving of God and the brothers 2:3-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first condition of the divine fellowship involves both sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sin and sins are a serious problem concerning our enjoyment of the divine fellowship, for they cause our fellowship with the Triune God to be frustrated and broken.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the apostle John devotes a number of verses to confessing our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before we consider these verses, I would like to bring to our attention some matters that will help us to understand John s writing concerning sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>INDWELLING SIN</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the Bible, sin dwells within us, in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 7:20 says, But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word dwell here indicates that sin is something living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Anything that is not living, such as a chair, cannot dwell anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, you would not say that a chair dwells in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order for a certain thing to dwell in a particular place, that thing must be living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the fact that sin dwells within us indicates that sin is a living entity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The sin described in Romans 7 is personified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The activities of sin are those of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin takes occasion through the commandment and works coveting in us v. 8 . Furthermore, sin may deceive us and kill us v. 11 . According to Paul s word in verse 17, sin dwells in us and does certain things in us: So now it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, Paul says that sin enters Rom 5:12 , reigns Rom 5:21 , lords it over people Rom 6:14 , works death in us Rom 7:13 , and is something that is quite alive Rom 7:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, sin is not a lifeless element or substance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the contrary, sin is a living thing that can dwell in us and do things against our will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was the reason Paul could say that it was not he who did certain things, but sin that dwelt in him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some oppose us for teaching that sin dwells in our flesh and that this sin dwelling in us is something personified.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, this teaching concerning indwelling sin and its activities is altogether according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot deny what Paul says in Romans 7 regarding sin.</S>
