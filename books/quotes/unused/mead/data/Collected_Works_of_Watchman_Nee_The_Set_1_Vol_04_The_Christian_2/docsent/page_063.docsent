   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse Fourteen</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 14: "But I have a few things against you, that you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"But I have a few things against you."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The words of praise are over.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now comes the word of rebuke!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the teaching of Balaam?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What characteristics does Balaam have?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of his greed, he set his mind to serve the king of Moab and to curse God's Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God had stopped him already, yet his heart was moved by the high place and the offer of gold, and he went to inquire of God again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the end, he went.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although many of the things he said were true, he said it not by will and not from his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By taking this way, he was bit by bit going downhill until he was clearly aligned with the world, scheming with the world to stumble God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is this not the case with the present church?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To barter God's truth is to go the way of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What then is the teaching of Balaam?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through Balaam's mouth, God told the Israelites that they should dwell alone and should not be reckoned among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet Balaam taught the Israelites to remove the wall of partition between them and the nations so that they would be joined to the Midianites and would worship the idols and sin together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the teaching of Balaam is the alliance with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The result of this teaching is to take away the church's qualification as a Nazarite and its zeal in loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The world and the church should be separated by a deep gulf.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet the teaching of Balaam causes Balak to build a floating bridge across it so that the church and the world can be joined together and can love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way of Balaam was to cause Balak to utilize the Moabite women to draw the Israelites to worship idols and to commit fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because the church is joined to the world, everything has become comfortable and easy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Comfort and ease lead to looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why the teaching of Balaam was able to prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The eating of things offered to idols and fornication are the sins which resulted from Balaam's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Holy Spirit had forewarned the church through Paul to stay away from these two particular sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please read 1 Corinthians 6, 8, and 10.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Formerly, these two sins caused the Israelites to become desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At this point they corrupted the chastity of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Outwardly speaking, Balaam was God's prophet, one who was near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, he tried to use his power for the purpose of gaining money.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He himself had no animosity against the Israelites, but his own belly was his own god.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When this god of his belly had a demand, he helplessly complied to curse the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He used sin and reveling to lower the standard of the Israelites so that they would become the same as the Midianites.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First there was friendship, then temptation, and finally sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a man is standing by the side of the pit of sin, the evil spirits will never sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Given an opportunity, they will push man down the pit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The eating of the food offered to idols is something for the belly, and fornication is a sin against one's own body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both cause the flesh to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The worldly associations, congregations, and lusts have led the Israelites and those in Pergamos into the pit of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet there is an unbroken line of followers behind the Israelites and those in Pergamos!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Balaam has corrupted the Israelites of its distinction and has caused it to mingle itself with the nations and their idols.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As such it is easy to understand its significance in type.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once the church is joined to the world, has received benefits from the world, and uses the world to attract fleshly men, the natural consequence is that the hired prophets will, for the protection of their own interest, do everything to corrupt the distinction of all the godly ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This degradation is a corporate degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It has never been repented of; much less has the lost ground been recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although throughout the ages there have been many individuals who have left this teaching, up to today the corporate recovery has not yet been seen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every step downward increases the speed of the decline.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, and the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, whose name is The God of hosts" Amos 5:25-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although since that time there have been many revivals and restorations, they have all been partial; there has never been a fresh start.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is the same not true for the church?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some have said that there is a new Pentecost now, but where is the new Pentecost?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Did not even the first Pentecost last for only a brief period of time?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"On you, the kindness of God, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off" Rom 11:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Have the Gentiles continued in His kindness?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Is it not rather the case that since the first day, the teaching of Balaam has become stronger and stronger and its disciples more and more numerous until the whole church is now conformed to this sinful teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No doubt the Israelites later moaned to remove the abominable things among them Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But allow me to say a gentle word: is not the church still holding on to what the Lord condemns here?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although there is a minority who opposes this kind of influence, how many are there who can escape the sway of its power?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the present time we should examine ourselves to see where we stand.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Are we in "Babylon" or are we "outside the camp?"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What have we done personally to separate the church from the world?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Second Corinthians 6 strictly forbids believers from bearing the same yoke with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Concerning this matter, have we fully "come out from their midst"?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Before God, our keeping of companions will be judged in the same way our works will be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although God wants to be our Father in experience, He cannot carry out His fatherly duty or manifest His fatherly love unless we come out from their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How numerous are the present number of congregations, denominations, and groups!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet how many of God's children among these groups remember the solemn teaching in 2 Corinthians 6?</S>
