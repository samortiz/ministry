   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Though our sins are forgiven, we remain sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We can call ourselves the forgiven sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But many believe that they are no longer sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They think that if we talk about being sinners, it means that we do not know the gospel that well.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But this may not be all that true.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul did not say that his sins were not forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But he did say that he was a sinner 1 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Have you seen the difference here?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you were to ask Paul if his sins were forgiven, he could not be so humble as to say no. But Paul could humbly say that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He could not deny the work of God in him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But neither could he deny his position in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although we have received fresh grace in Christ, God has not fully removed the problem of sin; we are still sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The problem of sin will not be fully solved until the new heaven and new earth appear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, this does not mean that we have not received a complete salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Please do not misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a few days we will come to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The thing that we must see clearly and accurately is that everyone in the world is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether you have sinned or not, as long as you are a man, you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When some listen to the gospel, they spend the whole time reasoning about how many or how few sins they have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But before God there is only one issue: Are you in Christ or in Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All who are in Adam are sinners, and as long as you are a sinner, nothing more needs to be said.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why then did Paul have to tell us in Romans 1 3 about all the sins that man commits?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These few chapters show us that sinners sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first three chapters of Romans prove that a sinner is known by the sins that he commits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But Romans 5 tells us what kind of person a sinner actually is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once I went to Jian in Kiangsi and one evening met a brother who is a security guard.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not believe that I was a preacher and a worker for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here was a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am a worker for the Lord and a servant of Christ, but he would not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, I had to prove to him that I was one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I gave him many proofs.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the end he did believe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, we are sinners already.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But this has not been proven to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first three chapters of Romans prove that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They give us the evidence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By showing us that we have sinned in such ways, these chapters prove to us that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Chapter five says that we are sinners, but the first three chapters prove that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let me relate another story.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Fukien, there were some robbers and kidnappers who had previously been nominal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Though they were robbers and kidnappers, their consciences were still somewhat exercised; therefore, if they realized that they had kidnapped a pastor or a preacher they would release him without ransom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By and by, when some were kidnapped, they said that they were pastors or preachers of such and such a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What could the robbers do?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After some time, they came up with a way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every time someone said that he was a pastor, the robbers would ask him to recite the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, and the Beatitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who could recite them had to be pastors, and so they were let go.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I heard this story recently and thought that it was very interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you were a pastor, you had to prove it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The robbers required that these people prove to them that they were pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the same way, God wants to prove to us that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without proving this to us, we may forget about our true self.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why Romans 1 3 enumerate all those sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is to show us that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After so many facts are presented there, we are proven to be sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, one should never think that it is the many sins that makes us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have been sinners for a long time already.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We do not become sinners after these sins are committed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must lay this foundation clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today you can walk out to the street and meet anyone, and take him by the hand and tell him that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If he says that he could not be a sinner because he has not murdered anyone or set fire to anyone's house, you can tell him that he is a sinner who has never murdered anyone or set fire to anyone's house.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If someone tells you that he never robs or commits fornication, you can tell him that he is a sinner who never robs or commits fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But no matter whom you meet, you can say that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the whole New Testament, only Romans 5:19 tells us who a sinner is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the other places in the New Testament tell us what the sinner does.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only this one place tells us who the sinner is.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A sinner can do a million things, but these do not constitute him a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As long as he is born in Adam, he is a sinner.</S>
