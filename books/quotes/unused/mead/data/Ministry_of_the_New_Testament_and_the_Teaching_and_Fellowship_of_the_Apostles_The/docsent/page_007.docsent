   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE TEACHING AND THE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE APOSTLES Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42; Matt 28:19-20; Heb 2:3; John 16:12-15; Col 1:25-28; Rev 22:18-19; Heb 1:2; Gal 1:6-9; 1 Tim 1:3-8; Col 2:4, 8, 16-18, 20-23; 2 Pet 3:15-16; 2 Tim 2:15; 1 John 1:1-3, 7; Phil 2:1; 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 4:3-4a; 1 Cor 5:9-13; 2 John 7, 9-11; Rom 16:17; Titus 3:10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the recent turmoil the first item damaged by the dissenting ones is the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second item of the spiritual things that was damaged is the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Along with this item, the matter of the apostles' fellowship was also misapplied and evilly interpreted by the dissenting ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament the term the teaching of the apostles was used first in Acts 2:42.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consisting of: The Teachings of the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>in the Four Gospels</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The apostles' teaching consists of, first, the teachings of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Matthew 28:19-20 the Lord charged the earlier disciples to teach the new believers all the things that He had commanded them in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, it is clear that the teaching of the apostles includes the teachings of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Teachings of the Apostles in the Acts</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The teaching of the apostles also includes the teachings of the apostles in the book of Acts Heb 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hebrews 1:1-2a says, "God...has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here it says that in the last days God speaks in the Son, that is, in the person of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From this we can realize that even the speaking of the apostles in the Acts is God's speaking in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Surely the Lord's speaking in the four Gospels was God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, we may think that it is wrong to say that the apostles' speaking in the Acts also is God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Hebrews 1:2, today God speaks in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Greek text there is no article before the word Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, the verse says, literally, that God speaks "in Son."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In his New Translation, J. N. Darby rendered this portion "in the person of the Son."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The entire New Testament economy of God is operated not in the person of the Father, but in the person of the Son through the person of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because all the apostles are the sons of God in the firstborn Son of God, their speaking for God is also God's speaking in the person of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God are considered as one in the person of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, all the speakings by the apostles are God's speaking.</S>
