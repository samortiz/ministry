   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO NATURAL AFFECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have spoken about being offended.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now I wish to say a word about natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the church life there should not be any natural friendships.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you regard certain ones as your special friends, it also is an indication that you are full of self.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Certain ones match your taste, and you fit their taste.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You feed one another s taste.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is very damaging, and it hinders the building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among the brothers and sisters in the church, there should be a pure divine love, but there should not be any personal affection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If any personal affection creeps into your relationship with the saints, it proves that you are full of self.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the church life there should be no such affection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To me, all the brothers and sisters are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To have a favorite among the brothers and sisters is to be full of self.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not to be a Peter, but a son of Jonah.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This damages the building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to receive the mercy of the Lord to regard all the saints as our brothers and sisters, but none as our friends.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the Lord s building in the church life, everything natural must be extracted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There should be no natural affection, relationship, or feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, we all must be fearful of natural affection and shun it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever a brother loves me in a naturally affectionate way, I am frightened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That is the time for me to exercise the key to deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I will lock myself and avoid that brother s affection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever you discover that you are feeding a brother s self and that he is feeding yours, you must use the key to lock the gate of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do not lock up the self, Satan will come out through the door of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then you and others will remain sons of Jonah.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You will not be Peters, and it will be impossible for the Lord to build the church with you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE HIDDEN SELF</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>More than nineteen hundred years ago, the Lord Jesus prophesied that He would build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But why, after so many centuries, do we not yet have the building?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is because the key of self-denial has been neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In these messages I have no desire to talk about doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But I do have a heart to fellowship with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Oh, the hidden self!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Peter had a good heart, but within him there was the hidden self that became the gateway for Satan to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I appreciate the Lord s discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I had been the Lord, I would not have had the discernment, but would have appreciated Peter s concern.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the Lord Jesus immediately discerned that Satan had come out through the gate of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am glad that in the churches we have the brothers houses and the sisters houses.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But, through experience, we have realized that there are two kinds of results from living in such a house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some form natural friendships; others become dissatisfied and disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, no matter what the situation may be, you should not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To be disappointed is a proof that you are in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The self of those who live in the brothers and sisters houses must be locked up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the self is locked up, we shall have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you exercise the key of self-denial, others may be offended, but you will not be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, you will be built up because the self in you has been locked up.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all need to use the prevailing key of self-denial to lock the self, the soul, and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Otherwise, the building up of the church will be frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>CRUCIFIED AND RESURRECTED</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 24 says, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. The Me in this verse means a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This Me is the pattern, the pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, this Me is the crucified and resurrected Me. If we are not crucified and resurrected, there can be no church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church comes into existence through the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Not only our self, which is defiled, but even the Lord s pure, sinless self had to be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the Lord had not denied Himself and gone to the cross, He could not have been resurrected, and there would have been no church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must follow after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that we must deny ourselves as He did and must allow ourselves to be crucified as He did.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Without this, it is impossible for the church to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever we sense that we are feeding the self life of another, we must say, Lord, I will follow You.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I will stop having so much contact with this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you do this, the building of the church will proceed.</S>
