   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RESURRECTION LIFE AND ITS PRECIOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You are probably aware that three Greek words are translated life in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Bios denotes the life of our physical body; psuche, the soul or the soulish life; and zoe, the uncreated, eternal life, which we did not have until we received the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The zoe life is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The presence of these three kinds of life within us makes us complicated and is the source of conflicts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Bios may feel tired, but psuche may want to go to a concert to listen to music.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each expects the other to go along with its feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Zoe proposes that they cease their disagreement and go to the meeting instead; then bios will rest, and psuche will have satisfaction, not with music but with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Zoe is not a condition nor a thing but a Person, Jesus Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"He that hath the Son hath life Gk., zoe " 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This life is the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Resurrection, symbolized by frankincense Lev 2:15 , is precious in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is sweeter even than the cross, which ushers it in. It is dearer than the incarnation, which was such a pleasure to God because He thus became one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Resurrection gives God more pleasure than did the creation of man and of the earth, even though these were a delight to Him and are the object of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In resurrection Christ is revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In resurrection God is now energizing us both to will and to do of His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In resurrection we shall all be glorified and be the sons of God in manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The ultimate consummation of resurrection will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>FROM FLESH TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let us see how the Gospel of John leads into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Gospel opens by referring to God as the Word which was in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then verse 14 tells us that "the Word became flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John ushers us out of eternity, where the Word was, and into time, where the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This One, who dwelt among us, "full of grace and reality," was the supreme attraction to His disciples for the three and a half years He was with them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then He told them that He was going away John 13:33; 14:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What He really meant was that He would become something further.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the Word, He had become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now He was to become the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 3</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even as early as the third chapter in John, the thought begins to change from the flesh to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Nicodemus came to converse with Him, the Lord's reply was, "Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" 3:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nicodemus could interpret the need to be born again only in a physical way, but the Lord said that the one born of the Spirit was like the wind, making a sound but not visible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Notice this turn here from the physical to the spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 6</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Chapter six of John further points us to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord said that He was the living bread.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"If anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world" 6:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Jews, like Nicodemus, took His words literally, in a physical sense, and could not figure out how this Man could give them His flesh to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord's further "hard word" to His disciples about eating His flesh and drinking His blood He explained in verse 63, by again turning them to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"It is the Spirit Who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He meant that what He would give them to eat was not the meat of His physical body; that meat, "the flesh," was of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What was in store for them was Himself as the Spirit.</S>
