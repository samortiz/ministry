   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FULL REALIZATION OF THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This means that the divine life has never been realized adequately and fully by a group of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When people come to a local church they must see the full realization of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They should not see a kind of behavior and a kind of performance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They should just see people living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They should just see people who are in the full realization of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The divine life should be fully realized in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a realization of the divine life swallows up all gossiping, murmuring, reasoning, and debating.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It swallows up backbiting and politics.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God does not want to see good manners and politics in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wants to see Himself expressed from within you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the practicality of God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today God wants to recover such a lampstand in many leading cities on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He wants to have such a shining church, golden and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is, no doubt, a composition of human beings, but all these human beings are saturated with the heavenly gold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The substance of the divine Father becomes their very being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their very being is in the form of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And what they express is not just a nice behavior, but the shining Spirit, a sevenfold intensified shining.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a proper local church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a proper lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what the Lord is going to recover today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He has no intention to recover trivial matters such as long sleeves and short hair.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He wants to recover the Trinity fully enjoyed, possessed, realized, and expressed in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The proper local church is simply a church which possesses the Trinity, enjoys the Trinity, realizes the Trinity, and expresses the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this we all need the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not need just a onefold Spirit; we need a sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why we have to pray unceasingly and continually.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to pray to be filled up and saturated and permeated until we overflow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To enjoy the sevenfold Spirit simply means that the intensified Spirit floods you and fills you and overflows from within you to be the very fullness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This fullness is the expression, and this expression is just the shining in sevenfold intensification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the kind of local church that the Lord is going to recover.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not here just to have a church according to the outward teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What the Triune God wants to recover among us is a proper lampstand in all the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In every city the Lord wants to have such a shining lampstand as the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Among such local churches the Christ whom they experience is exactly the One revealed in Revelation 1.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a Christ has eyes as a flame of fire Rev 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may consider that His eyes indicate a kind of judging, but they also indicate a kind of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Out of His mouth proceeds a sharp two-edged sword to kill, not you, but your flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is to kill your murmuring and gossiping tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His feet are like shining brass, judging and burning and purifying.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes the messages in the Lord's recovery are just like a two-edged sword to cut and to judge, because God wants a pure golden lampstand in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Pure gold is gold which has been purified by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Christ today is the burning Christ for purification.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is not only washing us, but also purifying us by burning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the practicality of God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Don't consider that the practicality of God's expression covers such matters as how many elders a locality should have or how old the elders should be.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The practicality of God's expression is a matter of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is a matter of the saturation of the Triune God into your being to be your expression.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you see a vision of such a practicality, this vision will kill all your opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You would never think to have a school church or a church on your street or a church in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such a vision will kill all these different views.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You will be left with one city and one church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You will be left with one church which is so pure, so golden, so shining, so full of the Triune God.</S>
