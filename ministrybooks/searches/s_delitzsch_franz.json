He may be considered the greatest Hebrew scholar of his time. Once, he warned his students with the following words, \u201cThe battle now is around the Old Testament. Soon it will be around the New Testament. The battle has actually begun already. In the end, they will storm the bulwark of your faith\u2014Jesus Christ. The final battle is about to begin. By that time I will not be here any longer, but some of you will still be in the world. I earnestly exhort you to be faithful to the Lord, to stand up for Him, and to preach only Christ and Him crucified. I see the enemy retreating from his strong tower, and I see the bright dawn breaking. In that day our Savior, the King of kings and Lord of lords, will rule forever.\u201d This expert\u2019s warning is indeed true. The higher critics are doing exactly that very thing. At the beginning they only tried to destroy parts of the Old Testament. After that they tried to destroy the New Testament and now are attacking the Lord Jesus Christ. "}]}
