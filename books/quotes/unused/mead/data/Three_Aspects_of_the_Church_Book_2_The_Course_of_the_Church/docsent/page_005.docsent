   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRODUCED ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we speak of the revelation of the church, we must go back prior to the day of Pentecost, to the time before the work on the cross had been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we speak of the producing of the church, the fulfillment of the church, however, we must begin with the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church was first planned, then hidden, then revealed, and finally fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the day of Pentecost the church was not only in God s thought, but it had actually come out from within God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the day of Pentecost, the church was not just spoken of and revealed but also fulfilled and produced.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I put a Bible in my coat, some people can see that something is hidden and may ask, Brother, what do you have hidden in your coat?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If no one knows and if I do not tell anyone, the Bible is a mystery hidden in me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But I may ask a certain brother, Do you know what is in my coat?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then I would tell him that I have a Bible hidden in my coat, and he may understand that I have a Bible hidden in my coat, but he still has not seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of understanding is the same as that in Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Matthew 16 the Lord said that He would build His church upon the mystery of God s incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was a revelation, but it was also a prophecy, because at that time the church was not yet built.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is just like the Bible in my coat; one may know that it is there, but he has not yet seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I take this Bible out of my coat, he will see it totally and clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the story of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the day of Pentecost, the church was produced out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God clearly showed the church to the universe; therefore, all creation knew that the mystery in God was the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever is produced out of God is God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the beginning, when God created the heavens, the earth, and all things, all the angels seemed to wonder, What kind of story is this?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why has God created the heavens, the earth, and all things?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When God created Adam, called Abraham, and even inspired the prophet Isaiah, no one understood the real meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The angels did not understand, humans did not understand, God s chosen people did not understand, and even God s prophets did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was not until Matthew 16, when the mysterious, incarnated One was recognized, that the second aspect of the mystery was revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, this speaking was in the way of prophecy only.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the day of Pentecost, however, the church was properly produced, and the first aspect of the mystery became the second aspect of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first aspect of the mystery is the mystery of God, Christ; the second aspect of the mystery is the mystery of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Matthew 16 does not merely contain the two revelations of Christ and of the church; it also has a third revelation the revelation concerning the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But in this message we will emphasize only the first two revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The two revelations in Matthew 16 are a revelation of the fulfillment of Christ as the mystery of God and a prophetic revelation of the church as the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The revelation of the fulfillment was given by God, and the prophetic revelation was given by the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Father revealed Christ as the mystery of God, and the Son revealed the church as the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father told Peter about His mystery, and the Son told Peter about His mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Father revealed the fulfillment because Christ already had been incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Son revealed the prophecy because the enlargement of the incarnated Christ, the church, had not yet been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was not until the day of Pentecost that the church was produced; it came out from within God and was manifested among men, becoming the fulfillment placed before men and put within men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Despite the fact that the church was fulfilled, it was still a mystery to most people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the incarnation at Bethlehem, the mystery of God was manifested among men, but most people saw the mystery without understanding it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They still said, Is not this the carpenter s son?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And His sisters, are they not all with us?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>13:55-56; John 6:42; Luke 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as people did not understand the first aspect of the mystery in Bethlehem, they did not understand the fulfilled mystery of Christ on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They seemed to be asking, Are these not Galilean fishermen?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Are they not uneducated men and laymen?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How can they do these things?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Where did they get this boldness?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where did they get such wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The people did not know that they were seeing the enlargement of the mystery of God, which had become the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The day of Pentecost was a large Bethlehem; Bethlehem enlarged is Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The mystery of God was fulfilled at Bethlehem, and the mystery of Christ was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The fulfillment of this mystery was the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who know the Bible acknowledge that the entire Bible speaks of one mystery in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first aspect is the mystery of God, Christ; the second aspect is the mystery of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When people today see Christ, they understand God; when they see the church, they understand Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ is the expression of God, and the church is the expression of Christ; these two are two parts of one mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the good, important things in the Bible depend upon this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, if we do not know this mystery with two aspects, we do not know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we know this mystery, we can understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Bible is not merely a book of dead letters; it is living, full of the supply of life and power.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>People think that the Bible is a book of dead letters because they have not seen that the Bible is a narrative of this great mystery of two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>People have not seen that the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation speaks only of this mystery in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we put Genesis 1:26-27 together with Revelation 22:21, we can see that the entire Bible is about a mysterious man who is in the image of God and who can exercise authority for God; this mysterious man is Christ the Head and the church the Body .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This mystery is such a great matter that we must not only see it for ourselves, but we must also bring others into seeing it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In our living, we do not need to exhort people to have patience; when they see the mystery, they will have patience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Neither do we need to exhort people to love one another; when they see this mystery, they will have love within them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many who work for God pursue power and abundant life without realizing that as long as they touch this mystery, there is power and abundant life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This mystery is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are not able to be patient and holy or to have love and power in ourselves; everything rests with this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God wants to work this mystery into us, and the result is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must not only thoroughly know this matter, but we must also have much experience.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In this way our living, our service, our work, and our administration of the church will be unspeakably high, weighty, and full of rich content.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May the Lord open our eyes so that we may see this precious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is what the church needs today.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We absolutely believe and deeply feel that what the Lord wants to do in these last days is to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
