</div><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROPHECY<br>OF THE FIRST "SEVEN"&#151;<br>THE LAST WEEK OF THE SEVENTY WEEKS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Pet. 1:19; Matt. 24:32-44; Luke 21:25-36; Rev. 3:10-11; Dan. 9:24-27 (new translation)</H1><P>In this series of messages we want to study the prophecy of the four "sevens" in the Bible. If we are going to know the prophecy concerning the consummation of this present age, we need to know the truth concerning these four "sevens." In this message we want to see the prophecy of the first "seven," which is the last seven years of this age spoken of as the last week of the seventy weeks in Daniel 9. The three other sets of "sevens" are in the book of Revelation. They are the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls. Revelation may be considered as a book of prophecy constituted with these three sets of "sevens." The first "seven" in Daniel 9 is related to these three sets of "sevens" in Revelation. The prophecy of these four "sevens" is related to the Messiah (Christ), the nation of Israel, the New Testament believers, and the church.</P><P>For our study of the prophecy of the first "seven," we would like to read a new translation of Daniel 9:24-27:</P><ol class="decimal" start="24"><li>Seventy weeks are apportioned out for your people and for your holy city, to close transgression, to make an end of sins, to make propitiation for iniquity, to bring in the righteousness of the ages, to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the most holy place.</li><li>Know therefore and understand that from the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem to Messiah, the Prince, will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again with street and moat, even in times of distress.</li><li>And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing; and the people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end of it will be with a flood, and even to the end there will be war; the desolations are determined.</li><li>And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week; and in the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the oblation [or, meal offering] to cease, and replace the sacrifice and the oblation with abominations of the desolator, even until the complete destruction that is determined will be poured out upon the desolator.</li></ol><P>The seventy weeks in Daniel 9 are apportioned into seven weeks, sixty-two weeks, and one week. In Daniel a week is seven years, so seventy weeks is four hundred ninety years. Seven weeks are forty-nine years, sixty-two weeks are four hundred thirty-four years, and the last week is seven years. The last week of the seventy weeks will be the last seven years of this present age, the age of the church. After these coming seven years, God's kingdom will be on this earth and that will be the thousand years for Christ to reign in the millennium.</P><P>The last week of the seventy weeks in Daniel 9 will be cut in half. The last half of this week is three and a half years, referred to by Daniel as a time, times, and half a time (Dan. 7:25; 12:7). These three and a half years are the very hub of John's prophecy of the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls. If we are going to understand the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls, we have to understand the last half of the last week of the seventy weeks of Daniel 9. This will be the last three and a half years of this present age. The overcomers will be raptured before these last three and a half years. The believers on earth at that time who are not matured will be left on earth to pass through the last three and a half years, which will be the time of the great tribulation. We must understand the prophecy concerning this period of time because our destiny lies there.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JOHN AND DANIEL BEING ONE</H2><P>In my study of the Bible in the past, I did not realize as I do today how John the apostle was so one with Daniel the prophet. During Daniel's time, the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and the temple and captured the Jews in 606 B.C. About seventy years later, Daniel received the revelation of the seventy weeks (cf. Dan. 9:2). About A.D. 100, John wrote the book of Revelation, so the time between the writing of Daniel and the book of Revelation is about six hundred years. Despite such a long period of time, their writings are one in their prophecy concerning the end of the present age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Apostle John and the Prophet Daniel<br>Being One in the Prophecy concerning<br>the Consummation of the Present Age</H2><P>The apostle John and the prophet Daniel were one in the prophecy concerning the consummation of the present age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The "a Time, and Times, and Half a Time"<br>in Revelation 12:14 Being<br>a Quotation from Daniel 7:25 and 12:7</H2><P>The "a time, and times, and half a time" in Revelation 12:14 is a quotation from Daniel 7:25 and 12:7. "A time" is one year, "times" is two years, and "half a time" is half a year. John's quoting of Daniel in this way shows us that he was one with Daniel and that his prophecy was given based upon Daniel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Beast in Revelation 13:1<br>Corresponding with the Fourth Beast<br>in Daniel 7:7</H2><P>Another evidence of John being one with Daniel is that the beast in Revelation 13:1 corresponds with the fourth beast in Daniel 7:7. In Revelation 13 there are two beasts. The first beast, referred to in verse 1, is the Antichrist, and the second beast is the false prophet. In Daniel 7 there are four beasts. These four beasts correspond to the empires of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. This fourth beast, which signifies the Roman Empire, is mentioned in Revelation 13 as the beast with seven heads and ten horns, signifying the coming ten kings of the revived and restored Roman Empire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Ten Horns, the Ten Kings,<br>and the Beast in Revelation 17:12<br>Corresponding with the Ten Horns,<br>the Ten Kings, and the Beast<br>in Daniel 7:23-24</H2><P>The ten horns, the ten kings, and the beast in Revelation 17:12 correspond with the ten horns, the ten kings, and the beast in Daniel 7:23-24.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Text of John 5:28-29<br>Corresponding with That in Daniel 12:2</H2><P>John and Daniel's being one in their prophecy can also be seen by the fact that the text of John 5:28 and 29 corresponds with that in Daniel 12:2. John 5:28 and 29 speak of the two resurrections. The resurrection of life is the resurrection of the saved believers before the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; 1 Cor. 15:23, 52; 1 Thes. 4:16), and the resurrection of judgment is the resurrection of the perished unbelievers after the millennium (Rev. 20:5, 12). Daniel 12:2 also speaks of these two resurrections. One is unto everlasting life, and the other is unto shame and everlasting contempt. This again shows the oneness of Daniel and John.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Standing and Angle of Daniel and John<br>in Receiving the Revelation<br>and in Seeing the Vision</H2><P>To see something we must have a proper standing and a proper angle. Many Christians read the Bible, but they do not receive any light or any vision. This is because their standing and angle are wrong. God's prophetic word is very particular. If we do not have the proper standing and angle, we will not see the vision. We need to have the standing and angle of Daniel and John in receiving the revelation and in seeing the vision.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Daniel Being in Captivity in Babylon;<br>His Heart Being Fully on God and His People,<br>His Temple, and His Holy City for God's Kingdom on the Earth; and Being in His Spirit, Fully Occupied with Prayer and Supplications to God</H2><P>Daniel was in captivity in Babylon (Dan. 9:1-2a); his heart was fully on God and His people, His temple, and His holy city for God's kingdom on the earth (Dan. 9:2b-19); and he was in his spirit, fully occupied with prayer and supplications to God (Dan. 9:20-23). We may be interested in prophecy, but what is our heart occupied with? Is our heart like Daniel's? Our heart has to be fully on God and His desire in order for us to receive the revelation and see the vision.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. John Being in Exile on the Island of Patmos; His Heart Being for the Word of God and the Testimony of Jesus in Participating in the Tribulation, Kingdom, and Endurance in Jesus; and Being in His Spirit on the Lord's Day, Seeking after the Lord and Looking<br>to His Appearing</H2><P>John was in exile on the island of Patmos (Rev. 1:9b); his heart was for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus in participating in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus (Rev. 1:9); and he was in his spirit on the Lord's day, seeking after the Lord and looking to His appearing (Rev. 1:10). Daniel and John were the same in their standing and angle, so they saw the vision.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SEVENTY WEEKS UNVEILED TO DANIEL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Seventy Weeks Being Apportioned Out for the People of Israel and for the Holy City, Jerusalem</H2><P>Seventy weeks were apportioned out for the people of Israel and for the holy city, Jerusalem (Dan. 9:24-27). At the time Daniel saw the vision of these seventy weeks, the country of Israel was lost into the hands of the Gentile nations. These nations were Babylon and then Medo-Persia. The holy city was destroyed, the holy temple was devastated, and they were in captivity for about seventy years. Daniel was in such a situation. Daniel had no heart to be there, but what could he do? He could not do anything except pray. He prayed again and again. Then a vision came to him. Something secret was unveiled to him&#151;the seventy weeks.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Close Transgression</H2><P>These seventy weeks were apportioned to close transgression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Make an End of Sins</H2><P>They were also apportioned to make an end of sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Make Propitiation for Iniquity</H2><P>Furthermore, they were apportioned to make propitiation for iniquity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. To Bring in the Righteousness of the Ages</H2><P>The seventy weeks were apportioned to bring in the righteousness of the ages (2 Pet. 3:13). Transgression will be closed, sins will be ended, and iniquity will be propitiated. The righteousness of the ages will also be brought in. This is the righteousness of eternity, or the eternal righteousness, which will be in the millennium as well as in the new heaven and new earth. In the millennium Christ will be the righteous One (Jer. 23:5), and He will rule the thousand-year kingdom in righteousness (Isa. 11:5-6). In 2 Peter 3:13, Peter says, "We are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells." Today there is injustice everywhere. But there will be an age, which will be the age of the ages, the age of the new heavens and new earth, in which righteousness dwells.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. To Seal Up Vision and Prophet</H2><P>After the seventy weeks are completed, the vision and prophet will be sealed up. Today we need the vision and the prophet, but when the seventy weeks are fulfilled, we will not need them anymore.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. And to Anoint the Most Holy Place<br>(the Holy of Holies)</H2><P>The seventy weeks were also apportioned out to anoint the most holy place, the Holy of Holies (Dan. 9:24). Before the seventy weeks are over, the temple will be rebuilt. Later, Antichrist will devastate and contaminate the temple. He will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, setting up his image in the temple as an idol to defile the holy temple of God (Matt. 24:15; Rev. 13:14-15; 2 Thes. 2:4). After the final three and a half years of this age, Antichrist will be completely destroyed, and the temple will be cleansed and cleared up. Then the most holy place, the Holy of Holies, will be anointed. When the Holy of Holies is anointed, the service of offering sacrifices and the oblation will be recovered.</P><P>The three and a half years of the great tribulation are referred to as forty-two months (Rev. 11:2), or twelve hundred sixty days (12:6). But Daniel 12:11 and 12 say, "And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days." In these verses twelve hundred ninety days and thirteen hundred thirty-five days are mentioned. The ones who wait until the thirteen hundred thirty-fifth day will be blessed.</P><P>At the end of the twelve hundred sixty days, Antichrist will be fully destroyed by Christ. Then thirty more days are needed to clear up the contaminated, devastated, and defiled temple. Therefore, at the end of twelve hundred ninety days, the temple will be cleared up. But still there will be no sacrifices or offerings. This service will need setting up. This will take another forty-five days, which makes thirteen hundred thirty-five days. Once this service is set up, all the people will be blessed in the offering of the sacrifices and oblations to God. For the children of Israel to be blessed is to enjoy the offerings. That blessing will be taken away by the Antichrist. From the time that Antichrist causes the offerings to cease to the day the Israelites enjoy the offerings again will be thirteen hundred thirty-five days.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The First Seven Weeks&#151;Forty-nine Years&#151;<br>Being for the Rebuilding of Jerusalem<br>and Being Fulfilled</H2><P>Now we need to see the sections into which the seventy weeks are divided. The first seven weeks&#151;forty-nine years&#151;were for the rebuilding of Jerusalem and were fulfilled (Dan. 9:25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Sixty-two Weeks&#151;<br>Four Hundred Thirty-four Years&#151;<br>Being to the Cutting Off (the Crucifixion)<br>of Messiah (Christ)</H2><P>The next sixty-two weeks&#151;four hundred thirty-four years&#151;were to the cutting off (the crucifixion) of Messiah, Christ (Dan. 9:26a). History tells us that from the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the year that Christ was crucified was exactly four hundred thirty-four years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Interval after the Sixty-two Weeks and<br>before the Last Week of the Seventy Weeks</H2><P>After the sixty-two weeks and before the last week of the seventy weeks, there was an interval, the length of which is not revealed and in which was the destruction of the city of Jerusalem and the sanctuary by the people of the prince (the Roman army of Titus) in A.D. 70; and the end of it would be with a flood, and there would be war even to the end; the desolations were determined (Dan. 9:26b). The interval after the sixty-two weeks and before the last week of the seventy weeks is the age of grace and the age of the church. This is also the age of mysteries. In this interval, everything that God did, is doing, and will do is a mystery. In this interval Christ is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church is the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). Christ and the church are the great mystery (Eph. 5:32). Revelation 10:7 says that these mysteries will be completed, finished, and over at the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet.</P><P>In this interval was the destruction of the city of Jerusalem by Titus with the Roman army in A.D. 70. Josephus, the Jewish historian, tells of how Titus devastated Jerusalem and the temple. This was a fulfillment of the Lord's prophecy in Matthew 24:2 concerning the temple: "Truly I say to you, A stone shall by no means be left upon a stone which shall not be thrown down." Daniel prophesies further that there will be war until the seventy weeks are completed. From the destruction of Jerusalem until today, there has been war after war.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE PROPHECY OF THE FIRST "SEVEN"&#151;<br>THE LAST WEEK OF THE SEVENTY WEEKS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. At the Beginning<br>of the Seven Years of the Last Week<br>of the Seventy Weeks,<br>Antichrist Making a Firm Covenant<br>with Israel and Breaking the Covenant<br>in the Middle of the Week</H2><P>At the beginning of the seven years of the last week of the seventy weeks, Antichrist will make a firm covenant with Israel; and in the middle of the week he will break the covenant. Daniel 9:27 says, "And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week; and in the middle of the week he will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and replace the sacrifice and the oblation with abominations of the desolator, even until the complete destruction that is determined will be poured out upon the desolator." Titus was a type of Antichrist. He destroyed, devastated, the holy city and the holy temple, and Antichrist will do the same thing. Titus killed and persecuted the holy people, and Antichrist will do the same thing. Daniel's prophecy considers them as one. The person referred to in verse 27 is the prince in verse 26 who will destroy the city and the sanctuary. That prince was Titus. But verse 27 refers to the coming Antichrist.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Causing the Sacrifice<br>and the Oblation to Cease</H2><P>In the middle of the last week of the seventy weeks, Antichrist will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease (Dan. 12:7b, 11a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Replacing the Sacrifice<br>and Oblation with Abominations,<br>i.e., Idols, of the Desolator, i.e., Antichrist</H2><P>He will replace the sacrifice and oblation with abominations, idols, of the desolator, Antichrist (Dan. 12:11b; Matt. 24:15; Rev. 13:14-15; 2 Thes. 2:4). In Matthew 24:15 the Lord speaks of "the abomination of desolation spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place." According to Revelation 13:14 and 15, the abomination of desolation is Antichrist's image, which is set up in the temple as an idol. Then 2 Thessalonians 2:4 tells us that Antichrist will sit in the temple to claim that he is God. Daniel 9:27 refers to the "abominations [plural] of the desolator." These abominations may refer to Antichrist himself, to his image, and to idols he puts into the temple.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Even until the Complete<br>Destruction That Is Determined<br>Will Be Poured Out<br>upon the Desolator, i.e., Antichrist</H2><P>These idols will remain in the holy place, in the temple, even until the complete destruction that is determined will be poured out upon the desolator, that is, Antichrist (Dan. 9:27; 2 Thes. 2:8; Rev. 17:11; 19:19-20). In other words, the idols will remain in the temple for three and a half years until Antichrist is fully destroyed by Christ. Christ will wipe him out with the appearing of His parousia, His coming.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Seven Years of the Last Week<br>Being the Last Seven Years of the Present Age</H2><P>The seven years of the last week will be the last seven years of the present age of the mysteries of God, concerning Messiah (Christ), the children of Israel, the believers, and the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Two Halves of the Last Week</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Last Week Being Cut into Two Halves<br>by Antichrist's Breaking of the Seven-year Covenant He Will Make with Israel</H2><P>Now we need to see something concerning the two halves of the last week. The last week of the seventy weeks will be cut into two halves by Antichrist's breaking of the seven-year covenant he will make with Israel (Dan. 9:27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The First Half Being before the Sixth Seal,<br>Which Comprises the Supernatural Calamities<br>on the Earth and Heaven and Which Will Be<br>the Initiation of the Great Tribulation<br>of Three and a Half Years,<br>the Last Half of the Last Week</H2><P>The first half will be before the sixth seal of the supernatural calamities on the earth and heaven (Rev. 6:12-17). During the sixth seal, the earth will become a place that is not suitable for man to live on. The sixth seal will be the initiation of the great tribulation of three and a half years, the last half of the last week.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Second Half of Three and a Half Years</H2><P>The second half of three and a half years is referred to in Daniel 7:25 and 12:7.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Counted from the Ceasing of the Sacrifice<br>and the Oblation, and the Replacing of These<br>with Abominations, Idols, by Antichrist,<br>at the Time of the Sixth Seal</H2><P>This second half will be counted from the ceasing of the sacrifice and the oblation and the replacing of these with abominations, idols, by Antichrist probably at the time of the sixth seal (Rev. 6:12-17). On the one hand, God will shake the earth and the heaven, making the earth an unsuitable place in which to live. On the other hand, Antichrist will break his covenant with Israel, and he will persecute the Jews and devastate the temple.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Time of the Great Tribulation, Beginning<br>from the Sixth Seal of the Seven Seals and Ending<br>at the Seventh Bowl of the Seven Bowls,<br>Being "the Hour of Trial Which is About to Come<br>on the Whole Inhabited Earth, to Try Them Who<br>Dwell on the Earth" (Revelation 3:10)</H2><P>The second half of the last week, the last three and a half years of this age, will be the time of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21, 15), beginning from the sixth seal of the seven seals (Rev. 6:12-17) and ending at the seventh bowl of the seven bowls (Rev. 16:17-21), which will be "the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth" (Rev. 3:10). The first five seals have nothing to do with the great tribulation. The great tribulation will be initiated by the sixth seal. The seven bowls will be the last woe of the great tribulation, and this tribulation is referred to as "the hour of trial."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Before the Three and a Half Years<br>of the Great Tribulation, the Overcomers<br>among the Believers Being Raptured into Christ's Presence (Parousia) in the Heavens</H2><P>Before the three and a half years of the great tribulation, the overcomers among the believers will be raptured into Christ's presence (parousia) in the heavens (Rev. 12:5-6; 14:1; Luke 21:34-36; Matt. 24:36-44).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. At the End (It Should Be in the Last Year)<br>of the Three and a Half Years of the Great Tribulation,<br>the Majority of the Believers, Both the Dead<br>and Resurrected and the Living, Being Raptured<br>into Christ's Presence (Parousia) in the Air</H2><P>At the end (it should be in the last year) of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, the majority of the believers, both the dead and resurrected and the living, will be raptured into Christ's presence (parousia) in the air (1 Thes. 4:16-17; Rev. 14:14-16; 2 Thes. 2:1, 3-4, 8). The New Testament clearly reveals that there will be at least two kinds of raptures. One is before the tribulation, and the other is after the tribulation. The one before the tribulation will be for the overcomers, and the one after the tribulation will be for the majority of the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) The Universal Woman,<br>Who Symbolizes the Majority of the Saints,<br>Being Nourished for Three and a Half Years<br>in a Place on the Earth Prepared by God<br>for the Living Saints Indicating and Proving<br>That the Majority of the Living Saints<br>Will Be Raptured after the Fulfillment of the Three<br>and a Half Years of the Great Tribulation</H2><P>The fact that the universal woman, who symbolizes the majority of the saints, will be nourished for three and a half years in a place on the earth prepared by God for the living saints (Rev. 12:6, 14), indicates and proves that the majority of the living saints will be raptured after the fulfillment of the three and a half years of the great tribulation; that should be in the last year of the three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Harvest,<br>Which Symbolizes the Majority<br>of the Living Saints, Being Reaped after the Worship<br>of Antichrist and His Image Also Indicating and<br>Proving That the Majority of the Living Saints<br>at the Lord's Coming Will Be Raptured<br>after the Great Tribulation<br>of Three and a Half Years</H2><P>The harvest, which symbolizes the majority of the living saints, being reaped (Rev. 14:14-16) after the worship of the Antichrist and his image (14:9-13) also indicates and proves that the majority of the living saints at the Lord's coming (14:14) will be raptured after the great tribulation of three and a half years.</P><P>During the time of the great tribulation, God will prepare a place to nourish His people who remain. This shows how kind our God is. This is similar to the way that the Lord took care of the children of Israel when they were in Egypt. God judged the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues, but the children of Israel were kept in a place called Goshen where they were covered, protected, and preserved.</P><P>These facts which will transpire prove that the majority of the saints who will not be matured before the great tribulation will be left on this earth to go through the time of the great tribulation. As we have pointed out, the earth at that time will be an unsuitable place in which to live. Those who have to pass through the time of the great tribulation will suffer something. The overcomers will have been raptured, and there will be many supernatural calamities. I believe it will be hard for the believers to love the world during that time. Do we believe that the Bible is the Word of God? We have to listen to all these things. My burden is not to teach prophecy. I am giving you a word of warning. Daniel's and John's hearts were on God. But where is our heart today?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE SPIRITUAL LESSONS<br>IN SEEKING THE LORD'S APPEARING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Giving Heed to the Prophetic Word<br>As to a Lamp Shining in a Dark Place,<br>Until the Day Dawns and<br>the Morning Star Rises<br>in Our Hearts</H2><P>In seeking the Lord's appearing, there are some spiritual lessons. First, we need to give heed to the prophetic word as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in our hearts (2 Pet. 1:19; Rev. 22:16; 2:28). Preceding the Lord's open coming, the Lord will appear as the morning star in the darkest hour of the night to those who are watchful and looking for His appearing (2 Tim. 4:8). They have been enlightened by the shining of the prophetic word, which is able to lead them to the dawning day and to the rising of the morning star in their hearts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Day and the Hour of the Overcomers' Rapture Not Being Knowable to Us, but the Year of the Rapture of the Majority of the Believers Being Able to Be Figured Out by Us according to the Last Week of the Seventy Weeks,<br>by the Parable of the Fig Tree Predicted<br>by the Lord in Matthew 24:32-33</H2><P>The day and the hour of the overcomers' rapture are not knowable to us (Matt. 24:36-44), but the year of the rapture of the majority of the believers can be figured out by us according to the last week of the seventy weeks, by the parable of the fig tree predicted by the Lord in Matthew 24:32-33. These verses say that the fig tree will become tender and put forth leaves. Then the Lord said that when we see this, we should know that the summer is near. In Matthew 24:32-33 the fig tree signifies the nation of Israel, becoming tender signifies the coming back of life, and putting forth leaves signifies the outward activities.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Fig Tree Signifying the Nation of Israel</H2><P>The fig tree is a symbol of the nation of Israel (Jer. 24:2, 5, 8; Hosea 9:10) and was cursed by the Lord in Matthew 21:19: "And seeing one fig tree on the way, He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves only. And He says to it, Let there no longer be fruit from you forever. And the fig tree was instantly dried up." The fig tree was full of leaves but fruitless, signifying that at that time the nation of Israel was full of outward show but had nothing that could satisfy God. From this time, the nation of Israel was truly dried up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Becoming Tender Signifying<br>the Coming Back of Life</H2><P>Eventually, the Jews in Israel lost their homeland and were scattered to many other nations. It seemed impossible that after so many centuries they could be brought back to their forefathers' land and be formed into a nation. But in 1948 the nation of Israel was reformed; that was the nation of Israel becoming tender, coming back to life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Putting Forth Leaves<br>Signifying the Outward Activities</H2><P>When the Jews regained Jerusalem in 1967, that was the fig tree putting forth its leaves. One of the final signs that will take place will be the rebuilding of the temple. According to recent news reports, some of the Jews are preparing for the rebuilding of the temple with all its services. The temple of God will be rebuilt before the Lord comes back (cf. Matt. 24:15; 2 Thes. 2:4).</P><P>In view of the Lord's coming back, we need to consider the world situation today. The tendency of the development in the political, economical, and military situation in Europe is toward that of a strong man rising up. This strong man will be the one who will sign the seven-year covenant with Israel. From the day that this strong man, Antichrist, signs this covenant with Israel, there are seven years left to the end of the present age. After three and a half years, he will break this covenant, and the second half of three and a half years will be the time of the great tribulation. Just before the initiation of the great tribulation, the overcomers of Christ will be raptured. If the believers who are alive at that time are not ready and matured, they will be left on the earth to pass through the time of the great tribulation. The tribulation will come from three directions: from God, from Antichrist, and from Satan. God will judge the entire universe by supernatural calamities, making the earth unsuitable for living. Satan and Antichrist will do their best to destroy and damage mankind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Summer Signifying the Age of the Restoration<br>of the Nation of Israel</H2><P>When we see the fig tree, symbolizing the nation of Israel, becoming tender and putting forth leaves, we should realize that the summer is near. Summer signifies the age of the restoration of the nation of Israel (Acts 1:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Items 1, 2, and 3 Listed Above Taking Place Before Antichrist Makes the Covenant<br>of Seven Years with the Nation of Israel<br>at the Consummation of the Present Age;<br>Hence, the Seven Years of the Last Week<br>Being Able to Be Figured Out</H2><P>The fig tree becoming tender and putting forth its leaves takes place before Antichrist makes the covenant of seven years with the nation of Israel at the consummation of the present age; hence, the seven years of the last week can be figured out.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Watching and Being Ready to Be Taken,<br>by Being "Stolen" by the Appearing Lord<br>as the Secret "Thief," into His Presence<br>(Parousia) in the Heavens</H2><P>We need to watch and be ready to be taken, by being "stolen" by the appearing Lord as the secret "thief," into His presence (parousia) in the heavens (Matt. 24:40-44). A thief comes to steal precious things at an unknown time. The Lord will come secretly as a stealing thief to steal you if you are so precious.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Taking Heed to Ourselves<br>and Being Watchful at Every Time,<br>Beseeching That We May Prevail to Escape<br>All the Things of the Great Tribulation</H2><P>We need to take heed to ourselves lest our hearts be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and anxieties of life, and that day of the great tribulation come upon us unexpectedly as a snare, as it will come in upon all those who dwell on all the earth; and furthermore, we need to be watchful at every time, beseeching that we may prevail to escape all the things of the great tribulation in the last three and a half years of the last week of the present age and to stand before the Son of Man, Christ (Luke 21:34-36). We need to be on guard that our hearts would not be weighed down with debauchery, drunkenness, and anxieties of life. Debauchery is indulgence in drinking and feasting. If our heart is full of anxieties, then it has no room for God, for Christ. We may even come to a meeting, but our heart is not in that meeting because it is preoccupied with worldly things. We need to guard our hearts because we do not want the day of the great tribulation to come upon us unexpectedly as a snare. This day will be like the flood which came unexpectedly to the people at Noah's time. We need to watch and pray that we may prevail to escape all these things and stand before the Son of Man. This corresponds with Revelation 14:1, which indicates that the raptured overcomers will stand before the Savior on Mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation (cf. Rev. 12:5-6, 14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Keeping the Word of Christ's Endurance<br>That We May Be Kept by Him<br>Out of the Hour of Trial,<br>Which Will Come on the Whole Inhabited Earth,<br>to Try Those Who Dwell on the Earth</H2><P>We also need to keep the word of Christ's endurance that we may be kept by Him out of the hour of trial which will come on the whole inhabited earth, to try those who dwell on the earth (Rev. 3:10). Today the word we keep is the word of endurance. As long as we keep the word of God, we will suffer. People will persecute us. Even our parents and relatives may despise us. We need to keep the Lord's word of endurance so that we may be kept out of the time of the great tribulation as a trial which will come on the whole inhabited earth to try those who dwell on the earth. We have to be watchful and ready to learn the spiritual lessons. To become matured is not an overnight matter. Therefore, we have to prepare ourselves for His coming by loving Him so that we can grow in Him and be matured for His appearing.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROPHECY<br>OF THE SECOND "SEVEN"&#151;<br>OF THE SEVEN SEALS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rev. 4:2-3; 5:1-7; 6:1-17; 8:1-2</H1><P>In this series of messages, we are burdened to see the prophecy of the four "sevens" in the Bible. In the previous message, we saw the prophecy of the first "seven"&#151;the last week of the seventy weeks in Daniel 9:24-27. This is a prophecy concerning the consummation of the age.</P><P>We also saw that the Lord Jesus prophesied concerning the consummation of the age in Matthew 24:32-33: "But learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near. So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors." The Lord's illustration here concerning the fig tree, which signifies the nation of Israel, covers three items: 1) becoming tender signifies the coming back of life; 2) putting forth leaves signifies the outward activities; 3) summer signifies the time of the restoration of the nation of Israel (Acts 1:6). The fig tree, the nation of Israel, passed through a long "winter" from the first century to A.D. 1948, when the nation of Israel was re-formed. That was the fig tree becoming tender, the coming back of life. In 1967 the city of Jerusalem was taken back by Israel (Luke 21:24). I consider this as the putting forth of leaves, the outward activities. Because these two things have taken place, we know that the summer is near, the time of the restoration of the nation of Israel, the age of the restored kingdom (Luke 21:30-31), which will begin at the Lord's second coming.</P><P>Another item that needs to take place before the Lord comes back is the rebuilding of the temple. In Matthew 24:15 the Lord speaks of "the abomination of desolation, spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place." This abomination refers to Antichrist's image set up in the temple of God as an idol (Rev. 13:14-15; 2 Thes. 2:4) at the beginning of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21). This means that the temple must be rebuilt before the great tribulation begins. According to recent news, a number of Jews in Israel are preparing for the rebuilding of the temple and for the priestly service in the temple.</P><P>In the previous message, we saw that according to Daniel 9, Antichrist will make a covenant with Israel at the beginning of the seven years of the last week of the seventy weeks, and in the middle of the week he will break the covenant. The last week will be cut into two halves by his breaking of this seven-year covenant with Israel. The second half of three and a half years will be the time of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21, 15). The overcomers will be raptured before the great tribulation, while the majority of the believers will be raptured at the end of the great tribulation. Since we know all these things, we need to watch and be ready for the Lord's appearing.</P><P>We have already seen the fulfillment of the Lord's prophecy regarding Israel in Matthew 24, which the Lord said had to take place before the consummation of the age. In Romans 9:27-28 Paul said, "And Isaiah cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved; for the Lord will execute His word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short." Paul said that the Lord would cut His word short in order to fulfill His prophecy in a rapid way. I believe that the present problems in the Middle East are part of the cutting short of the Lord's word. Today we are in a very critical time. When there is news that a strong man signs a treaty of seven years with Israel, what shall we do? We have to prepare ourselves to be raptured. Now we want to go on to see the prophecy of the second "seven"&#151;of the seven seals in the book of Revelation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE SCENE IN HEAVEN</H2><P>Before John, the writer of Revelation, saw the seven seals, he first saw a scene, a view, in the heavens (Rev. 4:2-3; 5:1-7; 6:1-17; 8:1-2). This scene in heaven was immediately after Christ's ascension into the heavens (see Rev. 5:6, note 3&#151;Recovery Version).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Throne Set There,<br>and God Sitting upon the Throne</H2><P>In this scene there was a throne, and God was sitting upon the throne (Rev. 4:2-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. On the Right Hand of God,<br>Who Sat upon the Throne,<br>Being a Scroll Sealed with Seven Seals</H2><P>On the right hand of God, who sat upon the throne, was a scroll sealed with seven seals (Rev. 5:1). The scroll is a record of the secret of God's economy concerning the entire universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. No One in Heaven<br>or on the Earth or under the Earth<br>Being Able, Worthy, to Open the Scroll<br>and to Break Its Seals</H2><P>John wept because there was no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth who was able, worthy, to open the scroll and to break its seals (Rev. 5:2-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Lion of the Tribe of Judah,<br>the Root of David, the Lamb, Overcoming<br>to Open the Scroll and Its Seven Seals</H2><P>Then he was told not to weep because the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, the Lamb, had overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals. This One came and took the scroll out of the right hand of God, who sat upon the throne, and He opened one of the seven seals (Rev. 5:5-7; 6:1).</P><P>The Lion is a symbol of Christ, portraying Him as a strong fighter against the enemy, as prophesied in Genesis 49:8-9. Christ's being the Root of David signifies that He is the source of David. When the Lord was living on earth, the Pharisees asked Him questions to test Him. Then the Lord asked them a question to silence them. He asked, "What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose Son is He?" (Matt. 22:42). When they answered that Christ was David's son, He replied, "How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said to My Lord, Sit on My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his Son?" (Matt. 22:43-45). This muzzled the mouths of all His opposers. Christ is not only the Son of David, the Branch of David (Jer. 23:5; 33:15), but also the Lord of David, the Root of David. As a descendant of David in His humanity, Christ is the Branch of David who issued out of David. But as the eternal God in His divinity, Christ is the Root of David, the source of David. Christ is also our redeeming Lamb in this present age. As such an all-inclusive One, He has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SEVEN SEALS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The First Four Seals&#151;<br>Four Horses with Their Riders,<br>Running in a Four-horse Race</H2><P>The first four seals are four horses with their riders, running in a four-horse race (Rev. 6:1-8). All four riders are not real persons but personified things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The First Seal&#151;<br>a White Horse and Its Rider,<br>Signifying the Spreading of the Gospel</H2><P>The first seal is a white horse and its rider, signifying the spreading of the gospel (Rev. 6:1-2). Revelation 6:2 says, "And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he who sits on it having a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and that he might conquer."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. A Bow Signifying That Christ's Fighting<br>for the Constitution of the Gospel of Peace<br>Is Finished and the Victory Is Won</H2><P>A bow is for fighting with an arrow. But here there is only a bow without an arrow. This indicates that the arrow has already been shot to destroy the enemy and that Christ's fighting for the constitution of the gospel of peace is finished and the victory is won.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. A Crown Signifying That the Gospel<br>Has Been Crowned with the Glory of Christ</H2><P>A crown signifies that the gospel has been crowned with the glory of Christ (2 Cor. 4:4). The gospel which we preach today has a crown, and this crown is the glory of Christ. We should not feel shameful when we preach the gospel. Rather, we should feel glorious. To preach the gospel is a glorious thing. Those who preach the gospel become the riders of the white horse.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. "Went Forth Conquering"<br>Signifying That the Gospel<br>Has Been Going Forth with Christ to Conquer<br>All Kinds of Opposition and Attack</H2><P>"Went forth conquering" in Revelation 6:2 signifies that the gospel has been going forth with Christ to conquer all kinds of opposition and attack. When I left mainland China in 1949, there were less than four million Christians there. When the Communists took over, they did their best to oppose, to restrict, and to persecute anyone who wanted to practice being a Christian. Despite such opposition, today there are at least over fifty million Christians in mainland China. This shows the victory which the gospel has gained there over the past forty years. Throughout all the generations, the gospel has been going on with Christ as the Victor.</P><P>According to the Bible, we have to preach the gospel to get sinners saved. We all have to bear fruit. Although we may admit that this is scriptural, we may not be bearing any fruit. This means that we are not on the white horse. If we are preaching the gospel, our interest is in God's kingdom. What is our interest today on this earth? We should be those who are laboring to get people saved to build up the Body of Christ for the kingdom of God. Most of us have to work to make a living. But all of us can separate a certain amount of time to the Lord for His interest. The unbelievers can always spare time for their amusement and entertainment. But we believers have God as our amusement and entertainment. We have no excuse for not preaching the gospel. We must be on the white horse for the spreading of the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Second Seal&#151;<br>a Red Horse and Its Rider,<br>Signifying the Spreading of War</H2><P>The second seal consists of a red horse and its rider, signifying the spreading of war. Revelation 6:3-4 says, "And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, another, a red horse went forth; and to him who sits on it, to him it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another; and a great sword was given to him." "Red" here signifies the shedding of blood. The red horse is a symbol of the raging of war, which is altogether a matter of shedding blood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. A Great Sword Signifying Weapons for Fighting</H2><P>A great sword signifies weapons for fighting.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. "To Take Peace from the Earth"<br>Signifying That War Is Continuing on the Earth</H2><P>"To take peace from the earth" signifies that war is continuing on the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. "That They Should Slay One Another" Signifying That People Will Fight One Another</H2><P>"That they should slay one another" signifies that people will fight one another. The Lord Jesus prophesied the same thing in Matthew 24. He told us that "nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom" (v. 7). When war is going on, the gospel should be going on. These two horses run together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Third Seal&#151;<br>a Black Horse and Its Rider,<br>Signifying the Spreading of Famine</H2><P>The third seal, consisting of a black horse and its rider, signifies the spreading of famine. Revelation 6:5-6 says, "And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he who sits on it having a balance in his hand. And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying: A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixes of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine." "Black" here indicating the dearth (Jer. 14:1-4), signifies the color of the visage of famished people (Lam. 4:8-9; 5:9-10). The black horse is a symbol of the spreading of famine, which causes a black visage.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. A Balance, a Scale Used to Weigh<br>Precious Things, Being Used Here to Weigh Food<br>Signifying the Scarcity of Food</H2><P>A balance, a scale used to weigh precious things, is used here to weigh food, signifying the scarcity of food (Lev. 26:26; Ezek. 4:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. A Quart of Wheat, Good Pay for a Day's Labor,<br>and Three Quarts of Barley,<br>Also Good Pay for a Day's Labor,<br>Signifying the High Price of Food in Its Scarcity</H2><P>A quart of wheat, good pay for a day's labor, and three quarts of barley, also good pay for a day's labor (Matt. 20:2), signifies the high price of food in its scarcity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. "Do Not Harm the Oil and the Wine"<br>(Oil and Wine Being for Man's Pleasure&#151;<br>Psalm 104:15&#151;<br>and Being Always in Short Supply and<br>Becoming Precious in Famine)<br>Signifying the Presence of Famine</H2><P>"Do not harm the oil and the wine" (oil and wine are for man's pleasure&#151;Psa. 104:15&#151;and are always in short supply and become precious in famine) signifies the presence of famine. War is always followed by famine. During the famine, oil and wine should be preserved and not harmed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Fourth Seal&#151;<br>a Pale Horse and Its Rider,<br>Signifying the Spreading of Death</H2><P>The fourth seal, consisting of a pale horse and its rider, signifies the spreading of death. Revelation 6:7-8 says, "And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and the name of him who sits upon it is Death; and Hades followed him. And authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with famine and with death and by the beasts of the earth."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Pale Signifying<br>the Color of the Appearance<br>of Those Stricken with the Plague</H2><P>Pale signifies the color of the appearance of those stricken with the plague.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Hades Following Death,<br>Signifying That Hades Receives<br>and Retains Those Whom Death Has Killed</H2><P>Hades following death signifies that Hades receives and retains those whom death has killed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Authority Being Given to Death and Hades<br>over the Fourth Part of the Earth<br>to Kill with Sword, Famine, and Pestilence,<br>and by the Beasts of the Earth</H2><P>Authority is given to Death and Hades over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword, famine, and pestilence, and by the beasts of the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Four Riders of the Four Horses&#151;<br>the Gospel, War, Famine, and Death&#151;<br>All Being Personified</H2><P>The four riders of the four horses&#151;the gospel, war, famine, and death&#151;are all personified.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Running of the Four-horse Race<br>Beginning from Christ's Ascension<br>and Continuing through<br>the Entire Age of the Church<br>to Christ's Coming Back</H2><P>The running of the four-horse race begins from Christ's ascension (Mark 16:19-20) and continues through the entire age of the church, to Christ's coming back. Beginning with the first century, the gospel has been spreading throughout these twenty centuries. War among the human race has also been proceeding simultaneously. War has always caused famine, and famine has issued in death. All these will continue until the end of this age. When the seventy weeks in Daniel are completed, the four-horse race will be over. The gospel, war, famine, and death will cease.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Fifth Seal&#151;<br>the Cry of the Martyred Saints</H2><P>The fifth seal is the cry of the martyred saints (Rev. 6:9-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Cry to Avenge Their Blood</H2><P>It is the cry to avenge their blood (Rev. 6:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Of Those Martyred<br>Because of the Word of God<br>and Because of Their Testimony, Including<br>the Martyrs of the Old Testament</H2><P>The fifth seal is the cry of those martyred because of the word of God and because of their testimony (Rev. 6:9b), including the martyrs of the Old Testament (Matt. 23:34-36).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Underneath the Altar Signifying<br>Underneath the Earth, Where Paradise,<br>the Comfortable Section of Hades,<br>That Keeps the Souls of the Martyred Saints Is</H2><P>These martyrs are underneath the altar. In figure, the altar is in the outer court of the tabernacle and the temple, and the outer court signifies the earth. Hence, underneath the altar signifies underneath the earth (Matt. 12:40), where paradise, the comfortable section of Hades (Luke 16:22-23) that keeps the souls of the martyred saints is (Luke 23:43).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. "How Long" Signifying That the Martyrs<br>Have Been Waiting in Paradise<br>for Quite a Long Time Already</H2><P>These martyred saints cry with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O sovereign Lord, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?" (Rev. 6:10). "How long" signifies that the martyrs have been waiting in paradise for quite a long time already.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. "Yet a Little While" Signifying That<br>the Martyrs' Cry Should Take Place<br>near the End of This Present Age</H2><P>Revelation 6:11 says, "And to each of them was given a white robe; and it was said to them that they should rest yet a little while, until the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed even as they were should be completed also." "Yet a little while" signifies that the martyrs' cry should take place near the end of the present age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. A White Robe Signifying That<br>the Martyrdom of the Martyrs<br>Was Approved by the Lord, and Rest Signifying<br>That They Are Resting in Paradise</H2><P>A white robe signifies that the martyrdom of the martyrs was approved by the Lord, and rest signifies that they are resting in paradise.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. "Until the Number of Their Fellow Slaves<br>and Their Brothers<br>Who Were About to Be Killed...<br>Should Be Completed"<br>Indicating the Martyrdom<br>during the Great Tribulation</H2><P>"Until the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed...should be completed" indicates the martyrdom during the great tribulation (Rev. 20:4). Many believers will be martyred by the Antichrist in those three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Sixth Seal&#151;<br>the Shaking of the Earth and Heaven</H2><P>The sixth seal is the shaking of the earth and heaven (Rev. 6:12-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. A Great Earthquake, the Sun Becoming Black,<br>the Whole Moon Becoming as Blood, the Stars Falling to the Earth, the Heaven Recoiling, and Every Mountain and Island Being Moved</H2><P>There will be a great earthquake, the sun will become black, the whole moon will become as blood, the stars will fall to the earth, the heaven will recoil, and every mountain and island will be moved (Rev. 6:12-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Kings, the Great Men, the Captains,<br>the Rich and the Strong, and Every Slave<br>and Free Man Hiding Themselves in the Caves<br>and in the Rocks of the Mountains</H2><P>The kings, the great men, the captains, the rich and the strong, and every slave and free man will hide themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, saying to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of Their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?" (Rev. 6:16-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. This Supernatural Calamity Being the Initiation of the Great Tribulation, Consisting of All the Calamities, Plagues, and Woes from This Sixth Seal to the Last Bowl of the Seven Bowls</H2><P>This supernatural calamity is the initiation of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21), consisting of all the calamities, plagues, and woes from this sixth seal to the last bowl of the seven bowls (Rev. 16:17-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Seventh Seal&#151;<br>the Entire Contents of the Seven Trumpets</H2><P>The seventh seal is the entire contents of the seven trumpets (Rev. 8:1-2). These contents are on both the negative side and the positive side.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. On the Negative Side</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Supernatural Calamities<br>of the First Four Trumpets</H2><P>The seventh seal, the entire contents of the seven trumpets, includes the supernatural calamities of the first four trumpets (Rev. 8:7-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Three Woes of the Last Three Trumpets</H2><P>The seventh seal also includes the three woes of the last three trumpets (Rev. 8:13&#151;9:21; 11:14-15a, 18, 19b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Seven Plagues of the Seven Bowls<br>as a Part of the Negative Contents<br>of the Seventh Trumpet</H2><P>The seventh seal includes the seven plagues of the seven bowls as a part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet (Rev. 15:7&#151;16:12, 17-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Destruction of the Great Babylon and<br>the Destruction of Antichrist and His False Prophet<br>in the War of Armageddon</H2><P>The negative contents of the seventh seal, the seven trumpets, also includes the destruction of the great Babylon (Rev. 17:1&#151;19:4) and the destruction of Antichrist and his false prophet in the war of Armageddon (Rev. 19:11-21; 16:13-16; 11:18c). The great Babylon has a religious aspect and a material aspect. The religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church, will be destroyed by Antichrist at the beginning of the great tribulation (Rev. 14:8; 17:16), while the material Babylon, the city of Rome, will be fallen, destroyed by God (Rev. 16:19), at the end of the great tribulation (Rev. 18:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. The Binding and Imprisoning of Satan</H2><P>The seventh seal includes the binding and imprisoning of Satan (Rev. 20:1-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. The Last Rebellion of Mankind<br>and the Perdition of the Devil, Satan</H2><P>It also includes the last rebellion of mankind and the perdition of the devil, Satan (Rev. 20:7-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. The Final Judgment<br>at the Great White Throne</H2><P>The seventh seal includes the final judgment at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). This will be an ending of all the evil matters and persons in the universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. On the Positive Side</H2><P>Now we come to the positive side of the contents of the seven trumpets, of the seventh seal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Kingdom of the World Becoming the Kingdom<br>of Our Lord and of His Christ,<br>and Christ Reigning Forever and Ever</H2><P>The kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever (Rev. 11:15, 17b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Rewarding<br>of the Lord's Slaves the Prophets,<br>and the Saints and Those Who Fear<br>the Lord's Name, the Small and the Great,<br>at the Judgment Seat of Christ</H2><P>There will also be the rewarding of the Lord's slaves the prophets, and the saints and those who fear the Lord's name, the small and the great, at the judgment seat of Christ (Rev. 11:18b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Marriage of the Lamb</H2><P>There will be the marriage of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9). This will be the marriage of Christ and His overcomers. The processed Triune God as the Lamb will marry the regenerated and transformed tripartite man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d.

The seven seals and the seven trumpets end with the New Jerusalem.</P><P>The book of Revelation can be considered as a scroll. Before the ascension of Christ, there was such a scroll, but it was not opened. After His ascension, Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, and the Lamb opened this scroll. The seven seals with which the scroll is sealed are actually the contents of the scroll and the contents of the book of Revelation. This book is just the opening, the unveiling, of the seven seals. Today by the Lord's mercy we have an open scroll before us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG> CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROPHECY<br>OF THE THIRD "SEVEN"&#151;<br>OF THE SEVEN TRUMPETS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rev. 8:1-13; 9:1-21; 10:7; 11:15-18; John 5:28-29; Dan. 12:2; 1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:16-17; Rev. 14:14-16; 2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 19:7-9; 16:13-20; 17:14; 19:11-21; 18:1&#151;19:4; 20:1-15; 21:1&#151;22:5</H1><P>In this series of messages, we want to see the prophecy of the four "sevens" in the Bible. In the first message, we saw the prophecy of the first "seven"&#151;the last week of the seventy weeks recorded in Daniel 9. In the second message, we saw the prophecy of the second "seven"&#151;of the seven seals. In this message we want to see the prophecy of the third "seven"&#151;of the seven trumpets.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE SEVEN TRUMPETS BEING<br>THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE SEVENTH SEAL</H2><P>The seven trumpets are the entire contents of the seventh seal (Rev. 8:1-2). In other words, the seven trumpets equal the seventh seal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SEVEN TRUMPETS BEING THE ANSWER<br>TO THE PRAYER OF THE MARTYRED SAINTS<br>IN THE FIFTH SEAL, MENTIONED<br>IN REVELATION 6:9-11,<br>AND THE PRAYER MENTIONED<br>IN LUKE 18:7-8 AND REVELATION 8:3-5</H2><P>The seven trumpets are the answer to the prayer of the martyred saints in the fifth seal (Rev. 6:9-11). In the fifth seal, the martyred saints under the altar are crying, "How long, O sovereign Lord, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?" (Rev. 6:10). Immediately after their prayer is the sixth seal, which is the shaking of the earth and heaven (Rev. 6:12-17). The supernatural calamity of the sixth seal will affect the earth and the heaven&#151;the sun, the moon, and the stars. God's shaking of the earth and the heaven will be a warning to men to consider their ways. They have to repent and come back to God.</P><P>Immediately following the sixth seal are the seven trumpets, the contents of the seventh seal, which are the answer to the prayer of the martyred saints. Their prayer in Revelation 6:10 is also referred to in two portions of the New Testament&#151;Luke 18:7-8 and Revelation 8:3-5. These saints are crying to God for the avenging of their blood, which they shed for God's purpose and for God's testimony. After their prayer, God begins to judge the earth in the sixth seal to make it an unsuitable place in which to live. Then He answers their prayer with the seven trumpets of the seventh seal. Now we need to consider the scene in heaven after the opening of the seventh seal in Revelation 8:3-5.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Prayers of the Saints in Revelation 8:4<br>Being for the Judgment of the Earth,<br>Which Opposes God's Economy,<br>and the Answer to the Saints' Prayers<br>Being the Execution of God's Judgment upon<br>the Earth by the Seven Trumpets That Follow</H2><P>The prayers of the saints in Revelation 8:4 must be for the judgment of the earth, which opposes God's economy, and the answer to the saints' prayers is the execution of God's judgment upon the earth by the seven trumpets that follow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In Revelation 8:3, "Another Angel"<br>Referring to Christ,<br>and "Incense" Signifying Christ<br>with All His Merits, Which Christ Adds<br>to the Prayers of the Saints That the Saints' Prayers May Be Acceptable to God</H2><P>In Revelation 8:3, "another Angel" refers to Christ, and "incense" signifies Christ with all His merits, which Christ adds to the prayers of the saints that the saints' prayers may be acceptable to God. This prayer is recorded as an insertion. By the end of Revelation 6, the first six seals have been opened. Chapter seven is an insertion between the sixth and seventh seals. Then at the beginning of chapter eight is the opening of the seventh seal. Immediately following the opening of the seventh seal is another insertion in Revelation 8:3-5. In this insertion Christ as "another Angel" is offering the saints' prayers to God. In the book of Revelation, Christ is mentioned four times as "another Angel" (Rev. 7:2; 8:3; 10:1; 18:1). In chapters seven, eight, ten, and eighteen of Revelation, Christ comes in as God's Angel to serve and to take care of God's chosen people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In Revelation 8:5, to Cast the Fire to the Earth<br>Being to Execute God's Judgment upon the Earth</H2><P>Revelation 8:5 tells us that Christ as the Angel "took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth; and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake." To cast the fire to the earth is to execute God's judgment upon the earth; hence, the thunders, voices, lightnings, and an earthquake came as signs of God's judgment, and the seven angels, who had the seven trumpets, prepared themselves to trumpet (Rev. 8:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The First Four Trumpets&#151;<br>the Intensified Supernatural Calamities</H2><P>As we have pointed out, the sixth seal is the initiation of supernatural calamities executed on the earth and on the heavenly bodies. The first four trumpets of the seventh seal are the intensified supernatural calamities (Rev. 8:7-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The First Trumpet&#151;Judgment on the Earth</H2><P>The first trumpet is the judgment on the earth. Hail and fire mingled with blood were cast to the earth. Furthermore, the third part of the earth, the third part of the trees, and all green grass were burned up (Rev. 8:7). In Revelation all the verbs are used in the past tense because in the eyes of God all the things prophesied in this book have already taken place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Second Trumpet&#151;Judgment on the Sea</H2><P>After judging the earth, God will judge the sea. The second trumpet is God's judgment on the sea. A great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; the third part of the sea became blood, the third part of the creatures in the sea died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed (Rev. 8:8-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Third Trumpet&#151;Judgment on the Rivers</H2><P>The third trumpet is the judgment on the rivers. A great star called Wormwood, burning like a torch, fell out of heaven upon the third part of the rivers and upon the springs of waters; and the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters that were made bitter (Rev. 8:10-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Fourth Trumpet&#151;Judgment<br>on the Sun, Moon, and Stars</H2><P>The fourth trumpet will be the judgment on the sun, moon, and stars. The third part of the sun, the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars were smitten, so that the third part of them might be darkened and the third part of the day and the night should not appear (Rev. 8:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Last Three Trumpets&#151;the Three Woes</H2><P>The last three trumpets are the three woes. Revelation 8:13 says, "And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth because of the remaining sounds of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to trumpet." The three woes will be the greatest, severest, and most intensified plagues. In the first four trumpets, man is not yet touched directly. God's judgment only touches the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun, moon, and stars, the heavenly bodies. But beginning with the fifth trumpet, God's judgment touches man directly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Fifth Trumpet&#151;the First Woe<br>as Judgment on Men<br>(Satan and Antichrist<br>Collaborating to Torment Men)</H2><P>The fifth trumpet is the first woe as judgment on men&#151;Satan and Antichrist collaborating to torment men (Rev. 9:1). A star out of heaven fell to the earth. The star refers to Satan, who will be cast down from heaven to earth. Revelation 9:1 and 12:9 show that Satan will be cast down to the earth from the heavens as a star. To him was given the key of the shaft of the abyss. The abyss is a bottomless pit. It is the dwelling place of the demons (Luke 8:31). Satan opened the shaft of the abyss, and after opening the shaft, smoke went up out of the shaft like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the shaft; and out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth, and authority was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have authority, to torment men (they were not to injure the grass, any green thing, any tree, and men who have the seal of God on their forehead) for five months, but not to kill them. Revelation 9:6 says that "in those days men shall seek death and shall by no means find it; and they shall long to die, and death flees from them."</P><P>The locusts were like horses prepared for war; crowns like gold were on their heads, their faces were like faces of men, their hair was like the hair of women, their teeth were like the teeth of lions, their breastplates were like breastplates of iron, the sound of their wings was like that of the chariots of many horses rushing into battle, and they have stinging tails like scorpions, in which is their authority to injure men five months. This was already prophesied in Joel 2:4-5, 25 and 1:6. The locusts have a king over them, the angel of the abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon (Rev. 9:1-11). The angel of the abyss is the beast, Antichrist, who will come out of the pit of the abyss (Rev. 11:7; 17:8). Abaddon means destruction, and Apollyon means destroyer. Antichrist is a destroyer who brings in nothing but destruction.</P><P>In the fifth trumpet, Satan as a star falls to the earth, and Antichrist as the king over the army of locusts torments people for five months. This is a collaborating work. Satan and Antichrist are working together to torment men by these locusts. The locusts here are not like the locusts in Exodus 10:12-15, because they have tails like scorpions, and stings, and they injure men (Rev. 9:10). They must be demon-possessed ones, because they come out of the smoke which issues from the dwelling place of the demons (Rev. 9:2-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Sixth Trumpet&#151;the Second Woe<br>as Further Judgment on Men<br>(Two Hundred Million Cavalry Troops<br>Killing the Third Part of Men)</H2><P>The sixth trumpet is the second woe as further judgment on men&#151;two hundred million cavalry troops killing the third part of men (Rev. 9:13-16). Revelation 16:12 indicates that these troops come from the rising of the sun, from the east. In the sixth trumpet, the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates were loosed. They had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they might kill the third part of men by the two hundred million cavalry troops. "For the hour and day and month and year" means that the four angels had been prepared unto the hour, plus the day, plus the month, and plus the year&#151;altogether thirteen months, one day, and one hour for the killing of men. The killing will last firstly one hour, then one day, then one month, and lastly one year. The riders of the horses had breastplates of fire, hyacinth, and sulphur. The heads of the horses were like heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulphur as three plagues to kill the third part of men. The authority of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails, which were like serpents and had heads, and with them they injure men. The rest of men did not repent of their idolatry, murders, witchcrafts, fornication, and thefts (Rev. 9:13-21). This indicates that the intention of God's judgment is that men may repent, but Revelation tells us that even after these severe judgments, men will still not repent.</P><P>God's judgment in the sixth trumpet as the second woe is seen in Revelation 9. All the items in Revelation 10&#151;14, except the rapture of the man-child and of the one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruit, will take place during the last three and a half years, the time of the great tribulation. Chapter ten tells us that during the three and a half years of the great tribulation Christ will come to the air to take possession of the earth (Rev. 10:1-7). Chapter eleven says that Jerusalem will be given to Antichrist and his people and will be devastated for forty-two months (Rev. 11:2). In the meantime, God sends His two witnesses, Moses and Elijah, to prophesy during the time of the great tribulation when Antichrist is blaspheming God and persecuting His people. These two witnesses will testify against him. Then they will be killed, resurrected, and raptured to Christ's parousia (presence) in the air (Rev. 11:3-12).</P><P>Chapter twelve points out that right before the beginning of the great tribulation, the man-child, the dead overcomers, will be raptured (Rev. 12:5). The rest of the saints, which are the majority of the church, will be kept in a place to be nourished by God for twelve hundred sixty days, which is forty-two months or three and a half years, the time of the great tribulation (Rev. 12:6). Chapter thirteen tells us that when Antichrist comes up out of the sea and the abyss, he will act according to his own will against God, persecute God's people, and kill the saints (Rev. 13:1-10). The false prophet will set up an image of Antichrist and force people to worship it (Rev. 13:11-15).</P><P>Chapter fourteen speaks of the Lord's reaping of the believers. The firstfruit of the believers will be raptured to the third heaven to be with Christ before the great tribulation (Rev. 14:1-5). Then Antichrist will destroy all religions when he breaks the covenant with Israel in the middle of the last week (Dan. 9:27; 11:31). The destruction of religious Babylon, the apostate Roman Catholic Church (Rev. 17:16), will take place at the beginning of the great tribulation (Rev. 14:8). Furthermore, during the great tribulation, an angel will preach the eternal gospel, telling people that they should fear and worship God and not be deceived to follow Antichrist (Rev. 14:6-7). This gospel will be received by a number of people who will obey this word and who will do much to help the persecuted Christians and Jews during the great tribulation. When the Lord returns, sits on His throne of glory, and judges the nations, He will consider these righteous ones as the sheep, who will enter into the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world. They will be the people, the citizens, in the millennial kingdom on earth for one thousand years. Those of the nations who do not obey the eternal gospel during the great tribulation, who mistreat the Christians and the Jews, will be condemned by Christ at His throne of glory. They will be considered as goats and will be cast directly into the lake of fire, where they will suffer eternal punishment (Matt. 25:32-46).</P><P>In addition to speaking of the eternal gospel in the great tribulation, Revelation 14 also speaks of the harvest of the majority of the believers and of the war of Armageddon, which is called "the great winepress of the fury of God" (Rev. 14:19). The evil persons are likened to grapes who will be gathered together at Armageddon. Christ will come down to tread on them as one treading a great winepress. Now we come to the seventh trumpet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Seventh Trumpet&#151;<br>the Conclusion of the Eternal Economy<br>of the Processed Triune God</H2><P>The seventh trumpet is the conclusion of the eternal economy of the processed Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Finishing of the Mystery of God,<br>as God Announced the Good News<br>to His Own Slaves the Prophets</H2><P>The seventh trumpet is the finishing of the mystery of God. Revelation 10:7 says, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to trumpet, the mystery of God also is finished, as He announced the good news to His own slaves the prophets."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) To Close the Present Age of Mystery</H2><P>The seventh trumpet closes the present age of mystery. Daniel 9:24 speaks of the seventy weeks, which were apportioned out to "seal up vision and prophet." To seal up vision and prophet is to close the age of mystery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) To Bring In the Coming Age of the Kingdom<br>and the Eternal Age of the New Heaven and New Earth</H2><P>The seventh trumpet will bring in the coming age of the kingdom and the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth. It comprises all the things from the end of the great tribulation to eternity future.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Coming of the Eternal Kingdom of God and<br>of Christ, in Which He Shall Reign Forever and Ever</H2><P>The seventh trumpet includes the coming of the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ, in which He shall reign forever and ever (Rev. 11:15-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) First, in the Millennium</H2><P>Christ shall reign first in the millennium, the one thousand years in the kingdom age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) After That, in the New Heaven and New Earth</H2><P>After that, Christ shall reign forever in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as its center.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Judgment of the Dead to Decide Who<br>among the Dead Should Participate<br>in the Resurrection of Life Before the Millennium,<br>and Who Should Be Left to Participate in the Resurrection of Judgment after the Millennium</H2><P>The seventh trumpet will include the judgment of the dead (Rev. 11:18b) to decide who among the dead should participate in the resurrection of life before the millennium and who should be left to participate in the resurrection of judgment after the millennium (John 5:28-29; Dan. 12:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Resurrection of the Dead Saints<br>and Their Being Raptured<br>with the Majority of the Living Saints<br>into Christ's Parousia (Presence) in the Air</H2><P>The seventh trumpet comprises the resurrection of the dead saints and their being raptured with the majority of the living saints into Christ's parousia (presence) in the air (1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:16-17; Rev. 14:14-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. The Giving of the Reward to the Prophets,<br>to the Saints, and to the God-fearing People<br>at the Judgment Seat of Christ</H2><P>Included in the seventh trumpet is the giving of the reward to the prophets, to the saints, and to the God-fearing people at the judgment seat of Christ (Rev. 11:18c; 2 Cor. 5:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. The Marriage of the Lamb</H2><P>The seventh trumpet includes the marriage of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9). After the judgment seat of Christ, the overcomers become the bride of Christ, and they marry Him as the Lamb.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. The Coming of God's Wrath<br>Because the Nations Were Wroth&#151;<br>the Third Woe, Comprising the Seven Bowls,<br>as the Most Severe Judgment on Men</H2><P>Then there is the coming of God's wrath because the nations were wroth (Rev. 11:18a). This wrath of God is the third woe, comprising the seven bowls, as the most severe judgment on men (Rev. 15&#151;16). The seven bowls will be the final judgment executed upon men in the great tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) At the Time of the Sixth Bowl,<br>the War of Armageddon Taking Place, in Which War<br>Christ and His Newly-wed Wife, the Overcomers,<br>Will Defeat Antichrist, the False Prophet,<br>the Kings, and Their Armies and Will Throw<br>Antichrist and the False Prophet into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>At the time of the sixth bowl, the war of Armageddon will take place. This will be the last war on earth before the thousand-year kingdom. This war is recorded as an insertion between the sixth and seventh bowls in Revelation 16:13-16. Christ and His newly-wed wife, the overcomers, will defeat Antichrist, the false prophet, the kings, and their armies, and will throw Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire (Rev. 17:14; 19:11-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) At the Time of the Seventh Bowl, There Being<br>the Greatest Earthquake Ever on the Earth, and<br>the Physical Babylon, the City of Rome, Being Destroyed</H2><P>At the time of the seventh bowl, there will be the greatest earthquake ever on the earth, and the physical Babylon, the city of Rome, will be destroyed (Rev. 16:17-20; 18:1&#151;19:4). The religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church, will be destroyed close to the beginning of the great tribulation (Rev. 14:8), and the physical Babylon, the city of Rome, will be destroyed at the end of the great tribulation (Rev. 18:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. The Binding and Imprisoning<br>of the Devil, Satan, the Dragon,<br>the Ancient Serpent, in the Abyss<br>for One Thousand Years</H2><P>After the destruction of Antichrist, the false prophet, and those who follow them, the devil, Satan, the dragon, the ancient serpent, will be bound and imprisoned in the abyss by an angel for one thousand years (Rev. 20:1-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>i. The Kingdom of One Thousand Years</H2><P>Then there will be the kingdom of one thousand years (Rev. 20:4-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) The Overcomers Will Reign with Christ</H2><P>In the millennial kingdom, the overcomers will reign with Christ (Rev. 20:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Overcomers Will Be Priests of God and of Christ</H2><P>Furthermore, the overcomers shall be priests to contact God and co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations in the millennium (Rev. 20:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>j. The Last Rebellion of Mankind</H2><P>When the thousand years of the kingdom are completed, there will be the last rebellion of mankind (Rev. 20:7-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Satan, Loosed out of His Prison,<br>Deceiving the Nations, Gog and Magog,<br>to War against the Camp of the Saints and the Beloved City</H2><P>Satan, loosed out of his prison, will deceive the nations, Gog and Magog, to war against the camp of the saints and the beloved city; and fire will come down out of heaven and devour them (Rev. 20:7-9). Satan's deceiving of the nations which are in the four corners of the earth is his deceiving of "Gog and Magog." This may indicate that in the last rebellion of mankind, instigated by Satan, Gog and Magog will take the lead, and the nations will follow. Gog and Magog, according to Ezekiel 38:2-3 and 39:1-2, must be Russia. Ezekiel 38:2 (ASV) indicates that Gog and Magog are of Rosh, Meschech, and Tubal, answering to Russia, Moscow, and Tobolsk. Ezekiel 39:2 (ASV) refers to these places as "the uttermost parts of the north." At the end of the millennium, Satan will instigate rebellious mankind from the uttermost parts of the north to attack God's people. But fire will come down out of heaven and devour these rebellious ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Devil, the Deceiver, Being Cast<br>into the Lake of Fire, Where Also<br>Antichrist and the False Prophet Are</H2><P>The devil, the deceiver, was cast into the lake of fire, where also Antichrist and the false prophet were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever (Rev. 20:10). Antichrist and the false prophet will be cast into the lake of fire a thousand years earlier than the devil (Rev. 19:20). After the thousand years, the devil will be thrown into it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>k. The Judgment at the Great White Throne,<br>After the Earth and Heaven Fled Away,<br>to Judge the Unbelieving Dead with the Demons</H2><P>The judgment at the great white throne, after the earth and heaven fled away, is to judge the unbelieving dead with the demons (Rev. 20:11-15). The Bible has a complete conclusion. God executes His judgment to deal with the living ones. At the great white throne, He will judge all the dead ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Death and Hades Being Cast<br>into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>Death and Hades will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14). The lake of fire is the "trash can" for the entire universe, into which all negative things, including death and Hades, will be cast. Death will be the last enemy destroyed by the Lord (1 Cor. 15:26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Unbelievers and the Demons<br>Being Cast into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>The unbelievers and the demons will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15). The lake of fire is prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). Since the unbelievers have followed the devil, they share the devil's judgment (John 16:11) and will become joint partakers of the devil's eternal torment. The demons, having also followed the devil, will share the same destiny.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>l. The Coming of the New Heaven and New Earth<br>to Be God's Kingdom Forever</H2><P>The seventh trumpet concludes with the coming of the new heaven and new earth to be God's kingdom forever (Rev. 21:1&#151;22:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) The First Heaven and First Earth Passing Away,<br>and the Sea Being No More</H2><P>The first heaven and first earth will pass away, and the sea will be no more (Rev. 21:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The New Jerusalem, the Holy City, Coming Down<br>to the New Earth as God's Tabernacle<br>and as the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb</H2><P>The New Jerusalem, the holy city, will come down to the new earth as God's tabernacle and as the bride, the wife of the Lamb. It will be the ultimate composition of all the redeemed people of God, and in it the saints will reign as kings with God and be supplied by the Triune God as the river of water of life and the tree of life (Rev. 21:2&#151;22:5). As the New Jerusalem, we will enjoy the Triune God, drinking Him and eating Him forever. We will be His royal, kingly family, the co-kings with Christ reigning forever and ever (Rev. 22:5). This is the destiny that God has assigned to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) The Restored Nations Being<br>the People around the New Jerusalem<br>and Being Sustained<br>by the Leaves of the Tree of Life</H2><P>The restored nations will be the people around the New Jerusalem and will be sustained by the leaves of the tree of life (Rev. 21:24-27; 22:2b). The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth with the restored nations is the end of the seven trumpets, which is also the end of the seventh seal and the end of the book of Revelation.</P><P>Because of the world situation today, I believe that our present study of the prophecy of the four "sevens" in the Bible is timely. Romans 9:27-28 says that the Lord will cut His word short in order to have a quick fulfillment of His prophecy concerning the nation of Israel. The present situation in the Middle East is the Lord cutting His word short so that the prophecies concerning Israel can be fulfilled quickly. As we have seen in the previous messages, the nation of Israel as the fig tree has become tender and put forth its leaves. Now the summer is near (Matt. 24:32). We are not teaching the biblical prophecies to satisfy people's curiosity. We desire to be enlightened by the Word, especially the prophetic word in the Bible. We need to give heed to this prophetic word as to a lamp shining in a dark place (2 Pet. 1:19). Then we will know where we are. The prophetic word will guide us to pass through the dark night until the day of the Lord's appearing dawns and the morning star rises in our hearts.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PROPHECY<br>OF THE FOURTH "SEVEN"&#151;<br>OF THE SEVEN BOWLS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rev. 11:18a, 18e; 14:8; 17:1-6, 15-16; 17:11-14; 19:11-21; 16:19b; 18:1&#151;19:5; 20:1-3; 14:6-7, 9-11; Matt. 25:31-33, 41-46a; Rev. 20:7-10, 12-15; 15:7&#151;16:16; 14:17-20; Isa. 63:1-6; 1 Cor. 15:52; Rev. 16:17-21</H1><P>In the first three messages of this series on the prophecy of the four "sevens" in the Bible, we have seen the first three "sevens." We have fellowshipped concerning the seven years of the last week of the seventy weeks, the seven seals, and the seven trumpets. In this message we come to the prophecy of the fourth "seven"&#151;of the seven bowls. We have seen that the seven trumpets are the contents of the seventh seal. In this message we want to see the seven bowls, which are the main part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet.</P><P>Seven is the number of completion in God's operation, such as seven days for God's creation, seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls for God's move on the earth. The seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls are divided into four and three. Among the seven seals, the first four seals form a group. As we have seen, these first four seals are four horses with their riders, running in a four-horse race. The four riders of the four horses signify the gospel, war, famine, and death. They begin from Christ's ascension and continue through the entire age of the church to Christ's coming back. The fifth seal is the cry of the martyred saints, the sixth seal is the shaking of the earth and heaven, and the seventh seal is the entire contents of the seven trumpets.</P><P>The first four trumpets also form one group like the first four seals. The first trumpet is the judgment on the earth, the second trumpet is the judgment on the sea, the third trumpet is the judgment on the rivers, and the fourth trumpet is the judgment on the sun, moon, and stars. The last three trumpets are the three woes, the woes of the great tribulation. The fifth trumpet is the first woe as judgment on men (Satan and Antichrist collaborating to torment men). The sixth trumpet is the second woe as further judgment on men (two hundred million cavalry troops killing the third part of men). The seventh trumpet is the conclusion of the eternal economy of the processed Triune God. Before the seven trumpets, there was already a judgment on the earth and on the hosts of heaven at the sixth seal. The extent of the damage of that judgment was not so definite as the damage of the first four trumpets.</P><P>At the seventh trumpet, there will be further judgments on the earth, the sea, the rivers, and the sun through the seven bowls (Rev. 16:1-21). Those will be the most severe judgments of God on the earth and heaven. Just as the seven seals and the seven trumpets, the seven bowls are also divided into four and three. The first four bowls are the most severe supernatural calamities. Therefore, the supernatural calamities in this universe will be repeated three times. The first time is in the sixth seal, the second time is with the first four trumpets, and the third time is with the first four bowls.</P><P>The seventh trumpet has both positive and negative contents. The positive contents are the finishing of the mystery of God, as God announced the good news to His own slaves the prophets (Rev. 10:7), the coming of the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ, in which He shall reign forever and ever (Rev. 11:15-17), the giving of the reward to the prophets, to the saints, and to the God-fearing people at the judgment seat of Christ (Rev. 11:18), the marriage of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9), the kingdom of a thousand years (Rev. 20:4-6), and the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:1&#151;22:5). Now we want to see the negative contents of the seventh trumpet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE NEGATIVE CONTENTS OF THE SEVENTH TRUMPET</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Wrath of God,<br>Which Came Because the Nations Were Wroth,<br>Constituting the Seven Bowls</H2><P>The seventh trumpet as the third woe includes the seven bowls. The negative contents of the seventh trumpet are the coming of God's wrath because the nations were wroth (Rev. 11:18a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Destruction of Those Who Destroy the Earth</H2><P>The negative contents of the seventh trumpet also include the destruction of those who destroy the earth (Rev. 11:18e).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Destruction of Antichrist,<br>His False Prophet, the Ten Kings, and<br>Their Armies at the War of Armageddon</H2><P>The destruction of those who destroy the earth includes the destruction of Antichrist, his false prophet, the ten kings, and their armies at the war of Armageddon. After mentioning the fall of religious Babylon, Revelation 14 speaks of the warning against the worship of Antichrist in the great tribulation (Rev. 14:9-12), the blessing of the martyrs in the great tribulation (Rev. 14:13), the harvest of believers close to the end of the great tribulation (Rev. 14:14-16), and the gathering of the grapes (the evildoers) at the end of the great tribulation (Rev. 14:17-20). This will be the great winepress, the war at Armageddon, where Antichrist, the false prophet, the ten kings, and their armies will be destroyed (Rev. 16:13-16; 17:11-14; 19:11-21). These ones are all the destroyers of the earth. At the war of Armageddon, they will be destroyed by Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Destruction<br>of Physical Babylon the Great&#151;<br>the City of Rome</H2><P>The destruction of physical Babylon the Great&#151;the city of Rome&#151;will be at the end of the great tribulation (Rev. 16:19b; 18:1&#151;19:5). This destruction will take place at the seventh bowl. Revelation 16:19 says, "And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the great was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath." Due to the great earthquake of the seventh bowl, the great city, Jerusalem will be divided into three parts. Furthermore, the city of Rome will be remembered before God to be utterly destroyed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Binding and Imprisoning of Satan<br>in the Abyss for One Thousand Years</H2><P>The destruction of those who destroy the earth includes the binding and imprisoning of Satan in the abyss for one thousand years (Rev. 20:1-3). This will take place after Antichrist and the false prophet are defeated and cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:19-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Casting of the "Goats," Those Who Worship Antichrist and Who Do Not Receive<br>the Eternal Gospel, into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>There will also be the casting of the "goats," those who worship Antichrist and who do not receive the eternal gospel, into the lake of fire (Rev. 14:6-7, 9-11; Matt. 25:31-33, 41-46a). After the destruction of Antichrist and the imprisoning of Satan, the nations who are left on earth will be judged at Christ's throne of glory. Christ will judge them, not according to the law of Moses or the gospel of Christ, but according to the eternal gospel. The eternal gospel consists of fearing and worshipping God and not following Antichrist. The nations who receive this gospel and who treat God's people well during the time of the great tribulation will be considered as "sheep." They will enter into the thousand-year kingdom to be its citizens. Those who follow and worship Antichrist and who do not treat God's people well during the time of the great tribulation will be considered as "goats." Christ will cast these ones into the lake of fire. They are also considered as the destroyers of the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Burning of Those<br>Who Join the Last Rebellion of Mankind</H2><P>The destruction of those who destroy the earth also includes the burning of those who join the last rebellion of mankind (Rev. 20:7-9). The last rebellion of mankind will be instigated by Satan, God's enemy, after the millennium. Fire will come down out of heaven and devour these rebellious ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Casting of Satan into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>Then there will be the casting of Satan into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:10). Satan was bound and imprisoned in the abyss for one thousand years. Then after the one thousand years, he will be loosed out of his prison (Rev. 20:7) to deceive the nations to rebel against God. These rebellious ones will be judged, and Satan will then be cast into the lake of fire to join Antichrist and the false prophet, who were cast into it a thousand years earlier (Rev. 19:20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Casting of the Unbelievers and<br>the Demons into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>Finally, there is the casting of the unbelievers and the demons into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:12-15). God's judgment with all the plagues and calamities is used by Him to sweep, to clean, the dirtied universe. All the dirt, the unclean things, will go into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the "trash can" for the entire universe. After the unbelievers and demons are cast into the lake of fire, death and Hades will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:14). Then the old heaven and old earth will pass away, and there will be a new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SEVEN BOWLS&#151;THE THIRD WOE,<br>THE LAST SEVEN PLAGUES<br>TO FINISH THE FURY OF GOD,<br>AS THE MOST SEVERE JUDGMENT ON MEN</H2><P>The seven bowls are the third woe (Rev. 11:14), the last seven plagues to finish the fury of God (Rev. 15:1), as the most severe judgment on men (Rev. 15:7&#151;16:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Main Part of the Negative Contents<br>of the Seventh Trumpet</H2><P>The seven bowls are the main part of the negative contents of the seventh trumpet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The First Four Bowls&#151;<br>the Most Severe Supernatural Calamities</H2><P>First, the supernatural calamities take place in the sixth seal. Then the intensified supernatural calamities take place in the first four trumpets. Finally, the most severe supernatural calamities will take place in the first four bowls (Rev. 16:2-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The First Bowl&#151;<br>a Sore upon the Worshippers of Antichrist</H2><P>The first bowl will be a sore upon the worshippers of Antichrist. Revelation 16:2 says, "And the first went and poured out his bowl into the earth; and there came an evil and malignant sore upon the men who have the mark of the beast and worship his image." In His last fury, God will mark the rebellious ones with a sore on their skin because they bear the mark of the beast.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Second Bowl&#151;<br>the Sea Becoming Blood<br>and Every Living Soul in the Sea Dying</H2><P>With the second bowl, the sea will become blood and every living soul in the sea will die. Revelation 16:3 says, "And the second poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living soul that was in the sea died."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Third Bowl&#151;<br>the Rivers and Springs Becoming Blood,<br>and People Drinking the Blood-water</H2><P>When the third bowl is poured out, the rivers and springs will become blood, and people will drink the blood-water (Rev. 16:4-7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Fourth Bowl&#151;<br>the Sun Burning Men with Fire,<br>and Men Being Burned with Great Heat<br>and Blaspheming the Name of God</H2><P>When the fourth bowl is poured out, the sun will burn men with fire, and men will be burned with great heat and blaspheme the name of God (Rev. 16:8-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Fifth Bowl&#151;<br>the Kingdom of Antichrist Becoming Darkened,<br>and They Gnawing Their Tongues for Pain<br>and Blaspheming God for Their Pains<br>and for Their Sores</H2><P>The fifth bowl will be poured out on the kingdom of Antichrist. His kingdom will become darkened, and they will gnaw their tongues for pain and blaspheme God for their pains and for their sores (Rev. 16:10-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Sixth Bowl&#151;<br>the Great River Euphrates Being Dried Up,<br>and the Way of the Kings from the Rising<br>of the Sun Being Prepared</H2><P>The plague of the sixth bowl is poured out upon the great river Euphrates, which is dried up so that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared (Rev. 16:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Vision Inserted<br>between the Sixth and Seventh Bowls&#151;<br>the Gathering for the War at Armageddon</H2><P>The vision inserted between the sixth and seventh bowls is the gathering for the war at Armageddon (Rev. 16:13-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. By the Three Unclean Spirits out of the Mouths<br>of Satan, Antichrist, and the False Prophet,<br>Going Forth to Stir Up<br>the Kings of the Whole Inhabited Earth</H2><P>The gathering at Armageddon takes place by the three unclean spirits out of the mouths of Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet, the satanic trinity, going forth to stir up the kings of the whole inhabited earth (Rev. 16:13-14). The three unclean spirits go out to stir up these kings before the sixth bowl. The sixth bowl will dry up the Euphrates to prepare the way of the kings. These kings have to travel to reach the Euphrates, so the three unclean spirits stir them up to come.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Fight Against Christ<br>and His Army</H2><P>Antichrist and his armies will fight against Christ and His army (Rev. 16:16; 17:12-14; 19:11-19). Christ and His chosen overcomers, His army, will defeat them. This will be the destruction of the destroyers of the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Treading of the Great Winepress<br>of the Fury of God</H2><P>The gathering of the Antichrist, the false prophet, and the ten kings, with their armies is the collecting of the "grapes" into the winepress. The war at Armageddon is the treading of the great winepress of the fury of God (Rev. 14:17-20; Isa. 63:1-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Lord's Reminding<br>of His Remaining Believers<br>concerning His Coming as a Thief</H2><P>Revelation 16:15 speaks of the Lord's reminding of His remaining believers concerning His coming as a thief. This warning should be before the seventh trumpet (1 Cor. 15:52).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Seventh Bowl&#151;<br>the Greatest Earthquake Ever and<br>the Great Hail of the Exceedingly Great Plague</H2><P>The pouring out of the seventh bowl brings in the greatest earthquake ever and the great hail of the exceedingly great plague (Rev. 16:17-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The City of Jerusalem<br>and the Cities of the Nations Falling</H2><P>The great earthquake causes the city of Jerusalem and the cities of the nations to fall (Rev. 16:19a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Physical Babylon the Great,<br>the City of Rome,<br>Being Given the Cup of the Wine<br>of the Fury of God's Wrath</H2><P>The physical Babylon the Great, the city of Rome, will be given the cup of the wine of the fury of God's wrath (Rev. 16:19b). Rome has given the wine of the fury of her fornication to the faithful saints among the nations (Rev. 18:3). Then God in vengeance will give her the wine of the fury of His wrath.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Every Island Fleeing<br>and Mountains Not Being Found</H2><P>After the seventh bowl is poured out with the greatest earthquake, Revelation 16:20 says, "Every island fled, and mountains were not found."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Weight of Every Hailstone Being a Talent,<br>and Men Blaspheming God<br>Because the Plague Was Exceedingly Great</H2><P>Revelation 16:21 says that great hail comes down out of heaven upon men. The weight of every hailstone is a talent, about one hundred pounds, and men blaspheme God because the plague is exceedingly great. In the midst of the downpour of this great hail, those in the empire of Antichrist will continue to blaspheme God. This proves that they have no intention to repent. Rather, they will fight against God to the end.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS<br>OF THE PRESENT AGE<br>AND THE GREAT TRIBULATION<br>OF THE THREE AND A HALF YEARS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rev. 12:14; Dan. 7:25; 12:7; Rev. 11:2; 13:5; 11:3; 12:6; Matt. 28:20; 13:39, 40, 49; 24:3; Dan. 12:13; Rev. 20:11-15; 11:15; Dan. 9:24; Rev. 3:10; 6:12-17; 7:1-8, 9-17; 8:7-13; 9:1-11; 12:9, 11-12; 9:12-21; 10:1-7; 11:1-13; 20:4-6; 14:14-16; 1 Cor. 15:22; 1 Thes. 4:16-17; Rev. 11:18c; 2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 19:5-10; 11:14; 15:1, 7-8; 16:1-16; 17:12-14; 19:11-21; 14:17-20; 16:17-21; 20:1-3; 14:6-7, 9-11; Matt. 25:31-33, 41-46; Rev. 12:13-17; 13:1-18; 14:8, 12; 15:2-4; Dan. 12:11-12; Joel 2:14</H1><P>Thus far in our fellowship, we have seen the prophecy of the four "sevens" in the Bible&#151;the last seven years of the present age (the last week of the seventy weeks), the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls. The last week of the seventy weeks, the final seven years of this present age, are very crucial, but actually nearly all the crucial matters will be crowded into the last three and a half years. This is why we need to see the events in the last three and a half years of this present age and the great tribulation of the three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS<br>OF THE PRESENT AGE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Three and a Half Years, Called "a Time and Times, and Half a Time" in Revelation 12:14 as a Quotation from Daniel 7:25 and 12:7,</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2> Equaling Forty-two Months or a Thousand<br>Two Hundred and Sixty Days</H2><P>The three and a half years, called "a time, and times, and half a time" in Revelation 12:14 as a quotation from Daniel 7:25 and 12:7, equals forty-two months (Rev. 11:2; 13:5) or a thousand two hundred and sixty days (Rev. 11:3; 12:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. As the Consummation (End) of the Present Age</H2><P>These three and a half years mentioned in Daniel and Revelation will be the consummation (end) of the present age (Matt. 28:20; 13:39, 40, 49; 24:3; Dan. 12:13). The word consummation means that there is a process that will be brought to completion or fulfillment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. For the Lord, on the Negative Side,<br>to Clear Away All the Negative Persons and Things, Leaving Only the Dead Unbelievers<br>and the Demons to Be Cleared Away<br>through the Judgment<br>at the Great White Throne<br>after the Millennial Kingdom</H2><P>The last three and a half years are for the Lord, on the negative side, to clear away all the negative persons and things, leaving only the dead unbelievers and the demons to be cleared away through the judgment at the great white throne after the millennial kingdom (Rev. 20:11-15). The world is becoming more evil as time goes on. It is full of evil persons and evil things. In the last three and a half years, the Lord will use a "universal broom" to sweep away all the negative things on the earth. Only the dead unbelievers and the demons will be left to be judged after the millennium at the great white throne and to be cast into the lake of fire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. For the Lord, on the Positive Side,<br>to Bring In His Eternal Kingdom<br>and the Eternal Righteousness</H2><P>The last three and a half years will be for the Lord, on the positive side, to bring in His eternal kingdom and the eternal righteousness (Rev. 11:15; Dan. 9:24). When the Lord returns and the age is consummated, there will be no more unrighteousness. The earth today has really been corrupted. There is no present remedy to its unrighteous and evil situation. Eventually, however, the Lord will sweep away all the evil persons and things into the lake of fire. Then there will be the eternal kingdom of Christ with His righteousness, which is the righteousness of the ages, the eternal righteousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE GREAT TRIBULATION<br>OF THREE AND A HALF YEARS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. According to the Lord's Promise to<br>the Overcomers in Revelation 3:10&#151;That They<br>Will Be Kept out of the Hour of Trial<br>Which Is about to Come on<br>the Whole Inhabited Earth&#151;<br>the Rapture of the Overcomers,<br>Both the Man-child in Revelation 12<br>and the Firstfruit in Revelation 14,<br>Must Be before the Sixth Seal, the Supernatural Calamities on the Earth and on the Heavens</H2><P>According to the Lord's promise to the overcomers in Revelation 3:10&#151;that the overcomers will be kept out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth&#151;the rapture of the overcomers, both the man-child in Revelation 12 and the firstfruit in Revelation 14, must be before the sixth seal, the supernatural calamities on the earth and on the heavens (Rev. 6:12-17). After further study, I believe that it is not reasonable to believe that the Lord would leave His overcomers to pass through the supernatural calamities of the sixth seal. Furthermore, according to Joel 2:30-31, there will not be much difference in time between the sixth seal and the first five trumpets (Rev. 9:1-11). Joel 2:30-31 firstly has the "blood" of the first and second trumpets, the "fire" of the first, second, and third trumpets (Rev. 8:7-10), the "smoke" of the fifth trumpet (Rev. 9:1-3), and then the "sun" and "moon" of the sixth seal (Rev. 6:12). Revelation 9:4 compared with 7:3 indicates that the fifth trumpet is very close to the sixth seal. The first five trumpets are a direct continuation of the sixth seal. Therefore, the sixth seal is the initiation of the great tribulation and should be considered as a part of "the hour of trial." The overcomers will be raptured before the sixth seal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Initiation of the Great Tribulation,<br>as the Supernatural Calamities That Take Place in the Sixth Seal, Occurring Immediately<br>before the Three and a Half Years or Just at the Beginning of the Three and a Half Years</H2><P>The initiation of the great tribulation, as the supernatural calamities that take place in the sixth seal, may occur immediately before the three and a half years or just at the beginning of the three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. One Hundred Forty-four Thousand of God's Chosen Israelites Being Sealed before the Opening of the Seventh Seal, to Preserve Them from the Plagues of the Seven Trumpets</H2><P>One hundred forty-four thousand of God's chosen Israelites will be sealed before the opening of the seventh seal, to preserve them from the plagues of the seven trumpets (Rev. 7:1-8; 9:4b). God is continually taking care of Israel in spite of their present unbelief. In the restoration of the nation of Israel, which began in 1948, the Jews returned to their fathers' land in unbelief. They will become as sinful as "Sodom" (cf. Isa. 1:9-10; 3:9; Jer. 23:14) and as worldly as "Egypt" (Rev. 11:8; cf. Ezek. 23:3, 8, 19, 27) until the return of Christ, their Messiah, when "all Israel will be saved" (Rom. 11:26). Before the opening of the seventh seal, God will seal all the Israelites whom He intends to preserve.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Record of a Great Multitude Standing before God's Throne and before the Lamb<br>in Revelation 7:9-17, Given Immediately<br>after the Sixth Seal, Implying That the Rapture of the Believers Should Begin<br>before the Opening of the Sixth Seal</H2><P>The record of a great multitude standing before God's throne and before the Lamb in Revelation 7:9-17, given immediately after the sixth seal, implies that the rapture of the believers should begin before the opening of the sixth seal. This record presents a picture in a general way of all God's people raptured to heaven from the time before the sixth seal to their enjoyment in eternity. This is a vision inserted between the sixth and seventh seals.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The First Four Trumpets,<br>Consisting of the Four Aspects<br>of the Intensified Supernatural Calamities<br>on the Earth and on the Heavens,<br>Taking Place at the Very Beginning<br>of the Three and a Half Years,<br>as a Direct Continuation of the Sixth Seal</H2><P>The first four trumpets, consisting of the four aspects of the intensified supernatural calamities on the earth and on the heavens (Rev. 8:7-12), will take place at the very beginning of the three and a half years, as a direct continuation of the sixth seal, the initiation of the supernatural calamities, and will probably all be trumpeted on the same day.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Last Three Trumpets Being the Three Woes</H2><P>The last three trumpets will be the three woes (Rev. 8:13). The calamities of the first four trumpets will touch only the earth and heaven, whereas the woes of the last three trumpets will hurt man's body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Fifth Trumpet, as the First Woe,<br>Being Brought In by Satan, Who as a Star Will Fall Out of Heaven to the Earth<br>at the Beginning of the Three and a Half Years<br>and Will Collaborate with Antichrist,<br>the Angel of the Abyss, to Torment Men<br>by the Demon-possessed Locusts for Five Months</H2><P>The fifth trumpet, as the first woe, will be brought in by Satan, who as a star will fall out of heaven to the earth at the beginning of the three and a half years and will collaborate with Antichrist, the angel of the abyss, to torment men by the demon-possessed locusts for five months (Rev. 9:1-11; 12:9, 11-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Sixth Trumpet, as the Second Woe,<br>Being the Plague of the Four Angels<br>Who Are Loosed from Their Bonds<br>at the Great River Euphrates<br>to Kill the Third Part of Men for<br>Thirteen Months, One Day, and One Hour,<br>by Two Hundred Million Horsemen</H2><P>The sixth trumpet, as the second woe, will be the plague of the four angels who are loosed from their bonds at the great river Euphrates to kill the third part of men for thirteen months, one day, and one hour, by two hundred million horsemen (Rev. 9:12-21). These thirteen months plus the five months of the fifth trumpet will be one and a half years of the three and a half years of the great tribulation. The locusts of the fifth trumpet only torment men for five months, whereas the two hundred million horsemen kill the third part of men. This means that the woe of the sixth trumpet is more severe than that of the fifth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Christ Coming to the Air<br>Probably before the Trumpeting of the Seventh Trumpet, for Him to Come and Take Full Possession of the Earth</H2><P>Christ will come to the air probably before the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet (Rev. 10:7a), for the purpose of taking full possession of the earth (Rev. 10:1-7). He will come down to the air and get everything ready so that He can come to the earth directly to take full possession of it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. The City of Jerusalem Being Trampled<br>by Antichrist for Forty-two Months,<br>That Is, a Thousand Two Hundred Sixty Days, during the Great Tribulation,<br>and the Two Witnesses of the Lord Prophesying during That Period of Time</H2><P>The city of Jerusalem will be trampled by Antichrist for forty-two months, that is, a thousand two hundred sixty days, during the great tribulation, and the two witnesses of the Lord will prophesy during that time and will be killed by Antichrist and resurrected to be raptured into Christ's parousia (presence) in the air (Rev. 11:1-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. There Being a Great Earthquake,<br>the Tenth Part of the City of Jerusalem Falling Because of the Earthquake, and Seven Thousand Being Killed in the Earthquake</H2><P>There will be a great earthquake, the tenth part of the city of Jerusalem will fall because of the earthquake, and seven thousand will be killed in the earthquake (Rev. 11:13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. The Seventh Trumpet Probably<br>Being Trumpeted on the Last Day<br>of the Three and a Half Years</H2><P>Now we need to see the contents of the seventh trumpet, which will probably be trumpeted on the last day of the three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. On the Positive Side</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Finishing of God's Mystery</H2><P>The first item on the positive side is the finishing of God's mystery. This is declared in Revelation 10:7. Daniel 9:24 says that the seventy weeks were apportioned out to seal up vision and prophet. To seal up vision and prophet is to finish the mystery of God. In the church age, the age of grace, everything concerning Christ and the church is a mystery (Eph. 5:32), but when the seventh trumpet is sounded, the age of mystery will be over.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Rapture of the Majority of the Believers&#151;<br>the Resurrected Ones and the Remaining Ones&#151;<br>into Christ's Parousia (Presence) in the Air</H2><P>The seventh trumpet includes the rapture of the majority of the believers&#151;the resurrected ones and the remaining ones&#151;into Christ's parousia (presence) in the air (Rev. 20:4-6; 14:14-16; 1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:16-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Rapture of the Two Witnesses<br>into Christ's Parousia (Presence) in the Air</H2><P>Included in the seventh trumpet is the rapture of the two witnesses into Christ's parousia (presence) in the air (Rev. 11:12). The two witnesses will probably be raptured on the same day as the majority of the saints. Revelation 12:6 says that the woman, symbolizing the majority of the saints, will be nourished in a place prepared by God for a thousand two hundred sixty days, or three and a half years. Therefore, their rapture must be on the last day of those three and a half years. The two witnesses prophesy a thousand two hundred sixty days (Rev. 11:3), so they must also be raptured on the last day of the three and a half years. Thus, both the majority of the saints and the two witnesses will be raptured on the last day of the great tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Giving of Reward to the Saints<br>at the Judgment Seat of Christ</H2><P>Then there will be the giving of reward to the saints at the judgment seat of Christ in the air (Rev. 11:18c; 2 Cor. 5:10). Christ will judge His believers, not concerning their eternal salvation, but concerning their dispensational reward.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. The Marriage of the Lamb</H2><P>After the rewarding of the saints, there will be the marriage of the Lamb (Rev. 19:5-10). Christ will marry the overcomers as His bride.</P><P>The above items are the positive side of the seventh trumpet. Now we need to see the negative side.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. On the Negative Side</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Seven Bowls&#151;the Third Woe,<br>the Last Seven Plagues to Finish the Fury of God,<br>as God's Most Severe Judgment on Men,<br>the Main Part of the Plagues of the Seventh Trumpet</H2><P>The seven bowls are the third woe (Rev. 11:14), the last seven plagues to finish the fury of God (Rev. 15:1), as God's most severe judgment on men, the main part of the plagues of the seventh trumpet (Rev. 15:7&#151;16:1). After the seven bowls, God's fury will be finished.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) The First Four Bowls<br>Consisting of the Four Aspects<br>of the Most Severe Supernatural Calamities<br>on the Earth and on the Heavens</H2><P>The first four bowls consist of the four aspects of the most severe supernatural calamities on the earth and on the heavens (Rev. 16:2-9). Thus, supernatural calamities will occur three times: in the sixth seal, the first four trumpets, and the first four bowls. The sixth seal is the initiation of supernatural calamities, the first four trumpets are the intensified supernatural calamities, and the first four bowls are the most severe supernatural calamities. These calamities will damage the earth and the heavens, making the earth an unsuitable place in which to live.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Fifth Bowl&#151;<br>the Kingdom of Antichrist Becoming Darkened</H2><P>When the fifth bowl is poured out, the kingdom of Antichrist will become darkened (Rev. 16:10-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) The Sixth Bowl&#151;<br>the Great River Euphrates Being Dried Up,<br>and the Way of the Kings from the Rising<br>of the Sun Being Prepared</H2><P>When the sixth bowl is poured out, the great river Euphrates will be dried up, and the way of the kings from the rising of the sun will be prepared (Rev. 16:12). In Revelation 9:14-16 we read that the four angels bound at the great river Euphrates will be loosed to stir up the kings to send their armies, the two hundred million horsemen, and in Revelation 16:12 we are told that at the outpouring of the sixth bowl, the water of the Euphrates will be dried up so that these kings and their armies may pass over it. Hence, the sixth trumpet and the sixth bowl are related to each other.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>4) The Gathering for the War at Armageddon</H2><P>Then there will be the gathering for the war at Armageddon. This war will be waged by Antichrist, his false prophet, the ten kings, and their armies (Rev. 16:13-16), who will be defeated by Christ and His overcomers (Rev. 17:12-14; 19:11-21), in the treading of the great winepress of the fury of God (Rev. 14:17-20; Isa. 63:2-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>5) The Seventh Bowl&#151;<br>the Greatest Earthquake and the Great Hail<br>of the Exceedingly Great Plague</H2><P>The seventh bowl will be the greatest earthquake and the great hail of the exceedingly great plague (Rev. 16:17-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>a) The City of Jerusalem and the Cities of the Nations Falling</H2><P>The city of Jerusalem and the cities of the nations all will fall (Rev. 16:19a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>b) The Physical Babylon the Great,<br>the City of Rome, Being Destroyed</H2><P>The physical Babylon the Great, the city of Rome, will be destroyed (Rev. 16:19b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>c) Every Island Fleeing and Mountains Not Being Found</H2><P>Every island will flee, and mountains will not be found (Rev. 16:20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>d) The Weight of Every Hailstone Being a Talent</H2><P>The weight of every hailstone will be a talent (Rev. 16:21). A talent equals about one hundred pounds.</P><P>(All the above positive and negative items of the seventh trumpet should take place on the same day, that is, the last day of the great tribulation.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Binding and Imprisoning of Satan<br>in the Abyss for One Thousand Years</H2><P>The negative side of the seventh trumpet also includes the binding and imprisoning of Satan in the abyss for one thousand years (Rev. 20:1-3). Following the defeat of Antichrist, Satan will be bound and imprisoned to clear up the rebellious earth that the kingdom of Christ may come (Rev. 20:4-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Casting of the "Goats,"<br>Those Who Worship Antichrist and Do Not Receive<br>the Eternal Gospel, into the Lake of Fire</H2><P>Another item on the negative side of the seventh trumpet is the casting of the "goats," those who worship Antichrist and do not receive the eternal gospel, into the lake of fire (Rev. 14:6-7, 9-11; Matt. 25:31-33, 41-46a). This will occur after the nations are gathered and judged at Christ's throne of glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. The Following Items Also Taking Place<br>during the Three and a Half Years<br>of the Great Tribulation</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. At the Very Beginning<br>of the Three and a Half Years of the<br>Great Tribulation, Satan and His Angels<br>Being Cast to the Earth and<br>Persecuting the "Woman"</H2><P>At the very beginning of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, Satan and his angels will be cast to the earth and will persecute "the woman," consisting of the majority of the believers (those who remain and have the testimony of Jesus and the Jews who keep the commandments of God), until the end of the great tribulation (Rev. 12:9, 12-13, 15-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Remaining Believers,<br>"the Woman," Being Kept and Nourished<br>for a Thousand Two Hundred and Sixty Days</H2><P>The remaining believers, "the woman," will be kept and nourished for a thousand two hundred and sixty days, that is, the three and a half years of the great tribulation, in a place prepared by God, where they will bear the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 12:6, 14, 17). The overcomers will be raptured, and the majority of the living saints will be left to pass through the great tribulation. But God in His mercy will bring them to a place prepared by Him, the "wilderness," where they will be nourished until the last day of the great tribulation when they will be raptured to Christ's parousia (presence) in the air. I believe that due to their testimony, some will believe in the Lord Jesus. Their testimony will not be totally in vain. The word "nourished" means that they will be fed and taken care of by the Lord and somewhat preserved from the plagues of the great tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Antichrist, as the Beast Coming out of the Sea,<br>Revolting against God and Persecuting<br>the Saints for Forty-two Months,<br>the Entire Time of the Great Tribulation,<br>and the False Prophet, as Another<br>Beast Coming Up out of the Earth,<br>Working with Antichrist</H2><P>Antichrist, as the beast coming out of the sea, will revolt against God and persecute the saints for forty-two months, the entire time of the great tribulation (Rev. 13:1-10). The sea is the Mediterranean Sea, out of which Antichrist will come. In Revelation 9:11, 11:7, and 17:8, we are told that Antichrist will come up out of the abyss. This indicates that the sea is the mouth of the abyss, because the abyss is in the heart of the earth (Rom. 10:7; Matt. 12:40), and the sea is above the earth. Antichrist will be a very demonic, devilish, and extraordinary person. His spirit, which has been existing in the abyss before he is born, will come up out of the abyss (see notes 81, 101, and 111 in Revelation 17,  Recovery Version). His body will come from one of the Gentile nations around the Mediterranean Sea. In the biblical figure the land signifies the nation of Israel, and the sea signifies the Gentile nations (Rev. 17:15).</P><P>The false prophet, as another beast coming up out of the earth, will work with Antichrist and seduce the people on the earth to worship Antichrist and his image; and whoever will not worship will be killed (Rev. 13:11-18). This beast will come "up out of the earth." Since the earth, the land, signifies the nation of Israel, this "another beast," the false prophet, will come out of the Jews. He may be Judas Iscariot (John 6:70-71), because after he died he went to "his own place" (Acts 1:25), not to "his people" as others did (Gen. 25:17; 35:29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Another Angel Flying in Mid-heaven and<br>Announcing to the Peoples on the Earth<br>the Eternal Gospel</H2><P>Another angel will fly in mid-heaven and announce to the peoples on the earth the eternal gospel: that they should fear God, give Him glory, and worship Him as the Creator of the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters. At the judgment of Christ at His throne of glory, the peoples who receive this eternal gospel will be considered as "sheep" and will enter into the millennial kingdom to be the citizens, and those who do not receive this gospel will be considered as "goats" and will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 14:6-7; Matt. 25:31-46.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Another Angel Following and Announcing<br>the Fall of the Religious Babylon the Great<br>in the Early Part of the Three and a Half Years of the Great Tribulation</H2><P>Another angel will follow and announce the fall of the religious Babylon the Great in the early part of the three and a half years of the great tribulation (Rev. 14:8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Another, a Third Angel,<br>Following the First Two and Warning People<br>during the Great Tribulation Not to Worship Antichrist and His Image, That They May Not<br>Be Tormented in the Lake of Fire</H2><P>Another, a third angel, will follow the first two and warn people during the great tribulation not to worship Antichrist and his image, that they may not be tormented in the lake of fire. This will test the endurance of the saints: the Jews, who keep the commandments of God, and the believers, who keep the faith of Jesus (Rev. 14:9-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Believers, the Late Overcomers,<br>Who Will Overcome the Worship of Antichrist<br>and His Image and Will Be Resurrected and Raptured to the Air over the Lake of Fire, Signified by the Glassy Sea,<br>Singing the Song of Moses and<br>the Song of the Lamb to Praise God<br>and Glorify His Name</H2><P>The believers, the late overcomers, who will overcome the worship of Antichrist and his image and will be resurrected and raptured to the air over the lake of fire, signified by the glassy sea, will sing the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb to praise God and glorify His name (Rev. 15:2-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. In Daniel 12:11-12<br>One Thousand Two Hundred Ninety Days and One Thousand Three Hundred Thirty-five Days Being Mentioned</H2><P>In Daniel 12:11-12 one thousand two hundred ninety days and one thousand three hundred thirty-five days are mentioned. One thousand two hundred ninety days refers to the time from Antichrist's stopping of the offering and sacrifice and his replacing of them with idols to the end of his desolating and defiling of the temple, which will be a thousand two hundred and sixty days (Dan. 12:11; Rev. 11:2-3), plus thirty days for the cleansing of the defiled temple. The children of Israel need thirty days to cleanse the devastated and defiled temple. One thousand three hundred thirty-five days will be forty-five days more than one thousand two hundred ninety days, which forty-five days will be for the preparation of the priestly service for the offering and sacrifice, that the blessing of the offering and sacrifice may be recovered for the people of Israel. Daniel 12:12 says, "Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days." Joel 2:14 says, "Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God" (ASV). According to this verse, the blessing is the offerings. Based upon this verse, we can say that the forty-five days will be for the preparation of the priestly service to resume the offering of the sacrifices, which has always been a great blessing to the people of Israel.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SHINING AND WARNING<br>OF THE PROPHETIC WORD<br>IN THE SCRIPTURES MADE MORE FIRM</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 3:15; John 1:19-25, 45-46; 7:40-42; Matt. 2:1-12, 19-23; Luke 2:39; Matt. 3:13; Dan. 9:24-27; Matt. 24:15; Rev. 11:2; 13:1-8; 2 Thes. 2:3-10; Dan. 12:2; John 5:28-29; Rev. 20:4, 6, 11-15; 1 Cor. 15:20-23, 52; 1 Thes. 4:16; Matt. 24:39-42; Luke 21:36; Rev. 3:10; 12:5; 14:1-5; 1 Thes. 4:15-17; Rev. 14:14-16; 15:2; Dan. 7:7-8; Rev. 17:8, 10-11; 16:16; Judg. 5:19; 2 Kings 23:29; Zech. 12:11; Rev. 14:18-20; 19:13-15; Isa. 63:1-6; Rev. 1:7; Matt. 24:26-28; Rev. 19:19-20; 2 Pet. 1:19; Luke 21:34; Rev. 2:26, 28</H1><P>In the previous message, we saw the last three and a half years of the present age and the great tribulation of the three and a half years. These three and a half years are for the Lord to clear away all the negative persons and things, leaving only the dead unbelievers and the demons to be judged at the great white throne after the millennium. On the positive side, these three and a half years are to bring in Christ's eternal kingdom and the eternal righteousness.</P><P>We also need to see that the last three and a half years of the present age are for the purpose of putting the Christians, the Jews, and the Gentiles into their proper posts. In the three and a half years of the great tribulation, God will deal with the Gentiles. First, they will be dealt with by the seven trumpets of the seventh seal. The first four trumpets are supernatural calamities on the earth and the heavens. The last three trumpets, the three woes, will touch man directly. The third woe is composed of the seven bowls as God's most severe judgment on men.</P><P>There will also be the war at Armageddon, waged by Antichrist, his false prophet, the ten kings, and their armies. They will be defeated by Christ and His overcomers in the treading of the great winepress of the fury of God. Revelation 14:20 says, "And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress up to the bridles of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia." The city here is Jerusalem. A thousand six hundred stadia is the distance of one hundred eighty-two miles from Bozrah (Isa. 63:1) to Armageddon (Rev. 16:16). Many will be killed in this war.</P><P>When Christ returns, He will set up His throne of glory to judge the nations who remain (Matt. 25:31-46). Those who are the goats will be cast into the lake of fire. Those who are the sheep will enter into the millennial kingdom to be the citizens. This is the way in which God will deal with the living Gentiles. The dead unbelievers will be judged at the great white throne after the millennium and will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:11-15).</P><P>The faithful Israelites who keep the commandments of God during the great tribulation will be transferred into the millennium as the priests on this earth (Zech. 8:20-23; Isa. 2:2-3). The overcoming Christians will be raptured before the three and a half years of the great tribulation, being kept out of the hour of trial. The majority of the saints who remain will be raptured at the end of the three and a half years. Then all the Christians will appear before the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). Some will be rewarded to  share in the reign in the kingdom of a thousand years as the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens (Rev. 20:6), whereas others will be disciplined to be matured during the thousand years (Matt. 25:30).</P><P>Eventually, in the millennial kingdom the overcoming Christians will be in the New Jerusalem as the kings, the saved Jews will be the priests, and the righteous Gentiles who are the sheep will be on the earth as the citizens. Then there will be a new universe&#151;the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God.</P><P>In this message we want to go on to see the shining of the prophetic word in the Scriptures made more firm. Second Peter 1:19 says, "And we have the prophetic word made more firm, to which you do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts." The Old Testament prophecies were made firm by Jesus Christ the Lord and by some of the apostles in the prophecies of the New Testament. The New Testament prophecies confirm the prophecies of the Old Testament. In other words, the New Testament prophecies make the Old Testament prophecies firm. What we have today is the prophecies made more firm to us. In the New Testament age, the shining of the prophetic word is stronger and the warning is also stronger.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE EXAMPLE OF MISSING<br>THE MESSIAH IN THE PROPHETIC WORD<br>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The People of Israel Expecting the Coming<br>of the God-promised Messiah</H2><P>At the time of Christ's first coming, the people of Israel were expecting the coming of their God-promised Messiah (Luke 3:15; John 1:19-25, 45-46). Before the Lord Jesus was born, a number of the children of Israel were expecting to meet their Messiah because they came to know, at least partially, the prophecies of the Old Testament, which spoke of God giving His people a Messiah, the Anointed One.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Many Missing the Coming of Their Messiah</H2><P>After Israel was taken over by the Romans, the Israelites were eagerly expecting their Messiah to come and rescue them out of the hands of the Roman imperialists. Yet many of them missed the coming of their Messiah in their time because of Christ's appearing from Galilee instead of from Bethlehem (John 7:40-42; cf. Matt. 2:1-12, 19-23; Luke 2:39; Matt. 3:13). They did not know the Old Testament so finely or accurately. Some of them knew that according to Micah 5:2 the Messiah would come from the city of David, Bethlehem. But Jesus, the Messiah, was born in Bethlehem in a somewhat hidden way that did not attract people's attention. Both His mother and her husband were poor. They lived in Galilee, a despised region. When the time came for Christ to be born, the Roman Empire decreed that the first census be taken. All the citizens were required to go to their own country and city. Thus, Mary and Joseph went from Nazareth to Bethlehem, their fathers' city, that the Savior might be born there for the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning the place of His birth.</P><P>After Jesus was born, Joseph and Mary had to take Him and flee to Egypt because of the persecution of Herod (Matt. 2:13-18). This was the fulfillment of a prophecy concerning Christ in Hosea 11:1 (cf. Matt. 2:15). After Herod died, they returned to Nazareth, "that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene" (Matt. 2:23). Apparently, Jesus came from Nazareth, but actually He was born in Bethlehem, fulfilling the prophecy in Micah 5:2. The chief priests and the scribes missed His coming, but the magi from the east saw His star and came to worship Him. Also, the elderly Simeon and Anna, who were in real fellowship with God, received the revelation that Mary's child was the Messiah (Luke 2:25-38), but most of the waiting ones did not recognize Him as God's Anointed One.</P><P>Today we have to learn the lesson of knowing the prophecies in a proper way. We may know them in a general way, but we may not know them so finely or accurately. Today we have the prophetic word made more firm than the prophecies in the Old Testament. I am doing my best to help us know these prophecies in a fine way, not just in a general way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SHINING AND WARNING OF THE<br>PROPHETIC WORD MADE MORE FIRM TO US TODAY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Prophetic Word Made More Firm to Us</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Second Half of the Last<br>of the Seventy Weeks, Prophesied by Daniel,<br>Having Been Made More Firm by the Word<br>of the Lord and the Apostle</H2><P>The second half of the last of the seventy weeks, prophesied in Daniel 9:24-27, has been made more firm by the Lord's words in Matthew 24:15 and Revelation 11:2 and 13:1-8, and by the apostle's word in 2 Thessalonians 2:3-10. The three and a half years of the great tribulation, the second half of the last of the seventy weeks, is very much defined, made more firm to us, in the New Testament. Today I have the boldness to say that the majority of the saints will be raptured on the last day of the three and a half years because Revelation 12:6 says that they will be nourished for a thousand two hundred sixty days, which is three and a half years. They will have to pass through the entire three and a half years. Then their nourishing will be finished, and they will be raptured. I also have the boldness to say that the last trumpet will be trumpeted on the last day of the great tribulation. According to 1 Corinthians 15:52, the saints will be resurrected at the last trumpet. The last trumpet will be the seventh trumpet. This understanding makes the prophecy of the consummation of the age more firm to me. I also have seen that the two witnesses will be raptured on the same day as the majority of the saints because they will prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days. After these days are completed, they will be raptured to the air into Christ's parousia, presence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Resurrection of the Dead, Prophesied by<br>Daniel, Having Been Made More Firm<br>by the Word of the Lord and the Apostle</H2><P>The resurrection of the dead, prophesied in Daniel 12:2, has been made more firm by the Lord's words in John 5:28-29 and Revelation 20:4, 6, 11-15, and by the apostle's words in 1 Corinthians 15:20-23, 52 and 1 Thessalonians 4:16. All of these scripture references show how fine the New Testament prophecy is concerning the resurrection of the dead.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Rapture of the Overcomers, Prophesied<br>by the Lord in Matthew, Having Been Made<br>More Firm by His Words in Revelation</H2><P>The rapture of the overcomers, prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 24:39-42 and Luke 21:36, has been made more firm by the Lord's words in Revelation 3:10, 12:5, and 14:1-5. In Revelation 3:10 the Lord says, "Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth." The hour of trial is the three and a half years of the great tribulation, including its initiation with the shaking of the earth and heaven in the sixth seal, which will be the beginning of the supernatural calamities. Revelation 12:5 speaks of the man-child being raptured to the throne before the three and a half years of the tribulation. After this rapture, the woman, signifying the majority of the remaining saints, will be nourished for a thousand two hundred sixty days, or three and a half years. Then Revelation 14:1-5 reveals that the firstfruit, the living overcomers, will be standing on Mount Zion in the heavens, having been raptured to the heavens before the great tribulation (vv. 6-13) and the harvest of the majority of the saints (vv. 14-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Rapture of the Majority of the Saints,<br>Prophesied by the Apostle,<br>Having Been Made More Firm by the Lord</H2><P>The rapture of the majority of the saints, prophesied by the apostle in 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, has been made more firm by the Lord's words in Revelation 14:14-16, 15:2, and 20:4, 6. Revelation 14:14-16 speaks of the harvest of God's crop on this earth, that is, the rapture of the majority of the saints living on earth. Then Revelation 15:2 depicts the overcomers who have passed through the tribulation and the persecution of Antichrist. These ones have been raptured and are standing on the glassy sea. The glassy sea mingled with fire is a miniature of the lake of fire and eventually becomes the lake of fire. The late overcomers' standing on the glassy sea indicates that they have overcome the lake of fire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Three More Things Made More Firm<br>by the New Testament Prophecies</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Producing of Antichrist</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) As a Beast Coming out of the Mediterranean Sea</H2><P>Revelation 13:1 says, "And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and on his heads names of blasphemy." The beast, which is the fourth beast mentioned in Daniel 7:7, is Antichrist. The sea is the Mediterranean Sea, out of which Antichrist will come. The territory of the Roman Empire in ancient times surrounded the Mediterranean Sea. Antichrist will be a Caesar of the restored Roman Empire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) A Little Horn Coming Up<br>among the Ten Horns of the Beast</H2><P>Antichrist is a little horn coming up among the ten horns of the beast (Dan. 7:7-8). The ten horns signify the ten kings of the restored Roman Empire (Rev. 17:12). These ten kings, ten horns, are also likened to the ten toes of the great image seen by Nebuchadnezzar in his dream (Dan. 2:42). They will submit themselves and their kingdom to Antichrist.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) Coming out of the Abyss underneath the Sea</H2><P>Antichrist comes out of the abyss underneath the sea (Rev. 17:8a). On the one hand, Revelation tells us that Antichrist will come up out of the abyss (Rev. 9:11; 11:7; 17:8). On the other hand, it tells us that he comes up out of the sea (Rev. 13:1). This indicates that Antichrist will come from two sources. His spirit, which has been existing in the abyss before he is born, will come up out of the abyss. His body will come from one of the Gentile nations around the Mediterranean Sea.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>4) The Seventh Caesar of the Roman Empire<br>Becoming the Eighth Caesar</H2><P>Antichrist, as the seventh Caesar of the Roman Empire, will be killed and resurrected with the spirit (from the abyss) of Nero, the fifth Caesar of the Roman Empire, to be the eighth Caesar of the Roman Empire (Rev. 17:8, 10-11; 13:3). Revelation 17:8a says, "The beast whom you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go into destruction." The beast, who is Antichrist, "was" in the person of Caesar Nero before John wrote Revelation. He "is not" at the time of John's writing, because Nero died by that time. He "is about to come up out of the abyss." This implies that Nero's spirit is now in the abyss and is about to emerge from it to take possession of the body of the slain and resurrected Antichrist, as indicated in Revelation 13:3.</P><P>Revelation 17:10 says, "And are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while." The seven kings are the seven Caesars of the Roman Empire. The first five have fallen, that is, they have died unnaturally (Judg. 3:25; 2 Sam. 1:10, 25, 27). They are Julius Caesar, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, all of whom either were murdered or committed suicide before John wrote Revelation. The sixth one, Domitian, who was also murdered, was living when Revelation was written; therefore, it was said of him that he "is." The "other," the seventh, who will be Antichrist, had "not yet come" at that time. "When he comes, he must remain a little while," and he will be slain and resurrected with the spirit of the fifth, who is Nero, to be the eighth.</P><P>Revelation 17:11 says, "And the beast who was, and is not, he also is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into destruction." Antichrist will be the coming seventh Caesar. But he "also is the eighth." According to Revelation 13:3, Antichrist will be slain and resurrected. In that resurrection, the spirit of Nero (the fifth Caesar), which comes up out of the abyss, will animate the dead body of the seventh Caesar, Antichrist. This one, composed of the fifth and seventh Caesars, is the eighth. Hence, he "is of the seven." It is no wonder that people marvel at the sight of such an extraordinary being (Rev. 17:8). Revelation 13:3 says that when Antichrist is resurrected from death, the whole earth marvels after him.</P><P>We know that the spirit of the coming Antichrist is the spirit of Caesar Nero because of Revelation 13:18&#151;"Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six." The number represented by the letters of the name Caesar Nero in Hebrew is six hundred sixty-six. By this we know that the eighth Caesar, the coming Antichrist, the beast, will have the spirit of Caesar Nero.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Location of Armageddon</H2><P>Another item which has been made more firm by the New Testament prophecies is the location of Armageddon (Rev. 16:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) The Meaning of the Name of Armageddon</H2><P>Armageddon, in Hebrew, means Mount Megiddo, which means the mount of slaughter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Location of Megiddo</H2><P>Megiddo is located west of the river Jordan, close to the Mediterranean Sea, between Samaria and Galilee (Judg. 5:19; 2 Kings 23:29; Zech. 12:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) The War at Armageddon</H2><P>The war at Armageddon is Christ's treading of the great winepress of the fury of God (Rev. 14:18-20; 19:13-15), which will begin from Bozrah (the royal city) of Edom (Isa. 63:1-6) and extend to Megiddo, a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia, that is, one hundred eighty-two miles, the city of Jerusalem being in the middle of this distance (Rev. 14:20). Revelation 19:13 says that the returning Christ is "clothed with a garment dipped in blood." The garment of Christ is dipped in blood and becomes red by His treading of the winepress of the fury of God at Bozrah, where the blood will rise "up to bridles of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia" (Rev. 14:20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Appearing of Christ</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Christ Coming with the Clouds</H2><P>Christ will come with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, those also who pierced Him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail over Him (Rev. 1:7). The tribes of the land are the twelve tribes of the Holy Land. Christ will come at the end of His parousia (presence). His parousia first was secret in the heavens and then in the air. At that time He is clothed with a cloud (Rev. 10:1). When His parousia appears on earth, He will be on the cloud (Rev. 14:14; Matt. 24:30; 26:64), and every eye will see Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Coming of the Son of Man Being as the Lightning</H2><P>Matthew 24:26-28 says, "If therefore they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, do not go forth;..for as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be. Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures shall be gathered together." Lightning is concealed in a cloud, waiting for an opportunity to flash forth. Christ also will be clothed with a cloud in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear like a flash to the earth. Hence, the lightning will be a sign of the end of the Lord's parousia.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) The Lawless One to Be Revealed</H2><P>Antichrist as the lawless one shall be revealed, and the Lord Jesus will slay him by the breath of His mouth and bring him to nothing by the appearing of His coming (2 Thes. 2:8; Rev. 19:19-20). "Appearing" implies the thought of shining or brightness. The shining of the Lord's coming will bring Antichrist to nothing, destroying him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>4) At the End of the Great Tribulation</H2><P>The appearing of the Lord's coming, His parousia, will be at the end of the three and a half years of the great tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Shining of the Prophetic Word</H2><P>Peter likens the word of prophecy in the Scripture to a lamp shining in a dark place (2 Pet. 1:19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In the Dark Age of Today</H2><P>This age is a dark place in the dark night (Rom. 13:12), and all the people of the world are moving and acting in darkness. The shining of the prophetic word is in the dark age of today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Until the Day Dawns and<br>the Morning Star Rises in Our Hearts</H2><P>The prophetic word of the Scripture, as the shining lamp to the believers, conveys spiritual light to shine in their darkness (not merely knowledge in letters for mental apprehension), guiding them to enter into a bright day, even to pass through the dark night until the day of the Lord's appearing dawns and the morning star rises in their hearts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Warning of the Prophetic Word</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Watching</H2><P>Because of the prophetic word, the Lord warns us to watch. In Matthew 24:42 the Lord says, "Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Taking Heed to Ourselves</H2><P>In Luke 21:34 the Lord warns us to take heed to ourselves that our hearts may not be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and anxieties of life, and that day come upon us suddenly as a snare.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Being Watchful, at Every Time Beseeching</H2><P>We also need to be watchful, at every time beseeching, that we may prevail to escape all the things which are about to take place and to stand before Christ (Luke 21:36). To escape all the things which are about to take place is to be raptured to the heavens before the great tribulation to meet Christ at the beginning of His parousia.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Keeping the Word of Christ's Endurance</H2><P>We also need to keep the word of Christ's endurance (Rev. 3:10). Every word that the Lord has spoken in the Bible is a word of endurance (cf. Rom. 15:4). If we keep what the Lord says, we will suffer. The Lord today is still suffering rejection and persecution with His endurance. We are the joint partakers, not only of His kingdom, but also of His endurance (Rev. 1:9). Hence, His word to us today is the word of endurance. To keep the word of His endurance, we must suffer His rejection and persecution.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Overcoming and Keeping the Lord's Works</H2><P>We also need to overcome and keep the Lord's works until the end (Rev. 2:26). The Lord's works are the things the Lord has accomplished and is doing. These works include all His doings to accomplish a full redemption for us. He died and resurrected to redeem us. He is still doing something today to sanctify us, transform us, and conform us to His image. These are the Lord's works which we have to keep. Many Christians have been enlightened to realize something of the Lord's works, but because of the world's attraction, they would not keep His works. Instead they would deny and forget about what Christ has accomplished for them. If we are the overcomers, we will not neglect the Lord's works. We will keep the Lord's redemption, telling people that Christ died and resurrected for us and that today He is still working within us to sanctify us, to transform us, to renew us, and to conform us to His glorious image. If we keep the Lord's works until the end, He will be the morning star to us at His appearing (Rev. 2:28).</P><P>Our study of the prophecy of the four "sevens" in the Bible is timely, especially because of the world situation today. The world situation is under the Lord's sovereign arrangement. He is working to arrange the world situation for the fulfillment of His prophetic word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</H2><P>Question: Are the overcomers who have already been raptured to the throne included in the judgment in the air at the judgment seat of Christ?</P><P>Answer: All the believers have to appear before the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). All the overcomers and all the defeated believers have to pass this "exam." The Lord Jesus was appointed to judge the living and the dead (2 Tim. 4:1). He will judge the living on His throne of glory at His second appearing (Matt. 25:31-46). This will be the judgment of the nations, the sheep and the goats, before the millennium. Then He will judge the dead on the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15). In addition to these judgments, there will be the judgment at Christ's judgment seat to judge the believers, not for eternal salvation or eternal perdition, but for reward or punishment. In the last three and a half years of this age, the Lord will clear away all the dirt from the universe. Then He will bring all the nations and the believers into their proper posts for a new start in the kingdom of a thousand years.</P><P>Question: We have seen that the temple will be rebuilt and the priestly service will begin again with the offering of sacrifices. Then during the tribulation, Antichrist will defile the temple. When the Lord returns at the end of the twelve hundred sixty days of the great tribulation, He will destroy Antichrist. Then it will take an additional thirty days to cleanse the temple (Dan. 12:11) and another forty-five days to set up the priestly service again with the offerings (Dan. 12:12). How do these offerings relate to the Lord's death on the cross?</P><P>Answer: In the Old Testament, the offerings were types of Christ, pointing to the Lord's coming to die for us. After the cross, in the millennium and even in eternity, the offerings will be a memorial, pointing back to what Christ did on the cross. Before the cross, the offerings are a type. After the cross, they will be a memorial. Isaiah 66 tells us that even in the new heaven and new earth, there will still be offerings in remembrance of what the Lord did for us in the age of grace (vv. 20-22).</P><P>Question: We have seen that the remaining believers during the three and a half years of the great tribulation, typified by the woman in Revelation 12:6, are taken to the wilderness where they will bear the Lord's testimony. Does that mean that some during the great tribulation will receive their testimony and receive salvation by grace?</P><P>Answer: It is likely that this will happen. We should not forget that these three and a half years will be a transitory period of time. On the one hand, the believers who remain on this earth during that time will surely be preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus. While they are being nourished in the wilderness, they will surely preach Jesus. On the other hand, an angel will be announcing the eternal gospel from the air (Rev. 14:6-7), warning those who are under Antichrist's persecution not to worship him.</P><P>Question: You mentioned that the two witnesses would be raptured on the same day as the majority of the saints, which will be the last day of the twelve hundred sixty days of the great tribulation. Revelation 11 says that the two witnesses prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days (v. 3). It also says that they are killed, that their corpses lie in the street of Jerusalem, and that after three and a half days they are raptured. Are the two witnesses raptured after twelve hundred sixty days or after twelve hundred sixty-three and a half days?</P><P>Answer: They will be raptured after twelve hundred sixty days. The three and a half days that their corpses lie on the street are included in these twelve hundred sixty days. Their being killed, their corpses' lying on the street, and their resurrection should be also considered as a part of their prophesying, a witnessing.</P></body></html>
