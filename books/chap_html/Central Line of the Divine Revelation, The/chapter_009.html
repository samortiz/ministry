Without You we are nothing and we can do nothing. Lord, be merciful to us and speak to us. Give us grace that we may humble ourselves as we come to You with Your Word. We look to You that You would shine upon us and upon every line as we read. Lord, give us light. Give us the instant utterance that we may speak what You have shown us. Amen.</P><P>Christ as the threefold seed touches the essence of the divine revelation. The revelation of the Bible is mainly an unveiling of Christ as the threefold seed: the seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14), the seed of Abraham (Gen. 17:8; Gal. 3:16), and the seed of David (2 Sam. 7:12-14; Matt. 1:1, 6; 22:42-45; Rom. 1:3; Rev. 22:16). The promise of the seed of the woman was given nearly six thousand years ago. The promise concerning the seed of Abraham was given two thousand years after the first promise, and the fulfillment of that promise came two thousand years later. The entire revelation of the Scriptures is wrapped up with the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David. This threefold seed links Christ as God to man and Christ as man to God. In other words, this seed makes Christ the mingling, the blending, of God and man.</P><P>As we pointed out in the previous message, the Bible tells us that Christ is the seed of only three persons: the woman (Mary); Abraham, the forefather of God's chosen people; and David, the one who founded the kingdom of Israel. These three are mentioned in a particular way in the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1. In verse 1 Christ was introduced as the son of David and the son of Abraham. This indicates that Christ is the seed of David and the seed of Abraham. Then at the end of the genealogy, Matthew records that Christ was born of Mary (v. 16). Mary's husband was Joseph, but Christ was not born of Joseph; He was born of Mary. This indicates that Christ is her seed, the seed of the woman.</P>
