   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE FORTY-NINE THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ASIA MINOR AND EUROPE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 15 Scripture Reading: Acts 18:5, 11; 9:11, 22; 13:5; 14:1; 17:1-3 PAUL S WAY OF PREACHING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The main thing we need to see in chapter eighteen of Acts is Paul s way of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to 18:5, when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was wholly occupied in the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acts 18:11 tells us that Paul settled in Corinth a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Corinth Paul first went to the synagogue to testify to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, Your blood be upon your head; I am clean.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From now on I will go to the Gentiles v. 6 . Paul then remained in Corinth teaching the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Acts 18:5 indicates that when Paul was in the synagogue, He came directly to the matter of testifying that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, in our preaching of the gospel to unbelievers, we may think that they will not listen to us if we speak to them concerning the Lord immediately and directly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to our concept, we may need some kind of opener for our gospel preaching, some way to open the listeners and gain their attention.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not say that we should never use an opener in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we must always remember what our job is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our job is not to do anything other than to present Christ to sinners and especially to minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some may say that it is very difficult to present Christ in a direct way to unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I agree that this is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore we need to learn how to have the power and impact necessary for this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>POWER THROUGH PRAYER,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE WORD, AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we would have power and impact in our gospel preaching, we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no need for us to pray until we speak in tongues in order to have the power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may have genuine power through prayer without speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, I have known a number of tongue-speakers who were not at all powerful in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At this point, let me relate to you a conversation I had many years ago with a Christian friend in Chefoo, my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This friend was the leader of a certain Pentecostal group.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I had known this brother for years, and the meeting hall for this Pentecostal group was very close to the church meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day this brother came to me with the intention of convincing me to take the Pentecostal way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because we were friends, I encouraged him to speak openly and frankly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I said to him, Brother, you have come to see me for the purpose of convincing me to practice the Pentecostal things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he told me that this was his intention, I indicated to him that I was happy to talk to him concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I asked this brother why he was so enthusiastic about the Pentecostal things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said that the reason for his enthusiasm was his belief that through speaking in tongues we may have power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then I said, Brother, let us pay attention to the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am not in favor of the Pentecostal things, but you are strongly for them and have been practicing them for years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would ask you to compare the number in your congregation with the number in ours.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You claim to be powerful because you speak in tongues, but you still only have about fifty meeting with you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not practice tongue-speaking, but we have hundreds meeting with us, hundreds who have been brought to the Lord through our gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Where, then, is your power?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You speak in tongues, but you do not have power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not speak in tongues, but we have genuine power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you know where this power comes from?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This power comes from prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I went on to testify to this brother regarding our practice of preaching the gospel at the time of the Chinese new year.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead of celebrating the Chinese new year, the saints in the church in Chefoo made preparations to preach the gospel to their relatives, neighbors, and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The last night of the year, which was a time of feasting according to Chinese custom, was for us a time of fasting and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then the next day, the first day of the year, we came together with our relatives, friends, and neighbors for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That gospel preaching was carried on with much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As I was preaching in the meeting hall, many saints were in different rooms praying until the message was over.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The power we experienced in our gospel preaching came from such prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I told my friend in Chefoo that we trust in prayer, not in tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In my talk with this brother, I went on to give him two further reasons for our power.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I told him that our power is not only through prayer but also in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We do not preach any strange or peculiar things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the contrary, our preaching is according to the word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This word is the truth, and the truth is prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is power in every word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We preach only the Word, not Chinese ethics or philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, instead of using many stories in our speaking, we mainly preach Christ according to the revelation in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because God s word is powerful, we have power in our gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I also told this brother that our power is in the Spirit and not in tongue-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We believe that we have the Spirit within us and also upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because we have the Spirit within us and upon us, we have power.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our power, therefore, is in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At this juncture I would like to give you a testimony of what happened one day as I was speaking in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I had the sense at a certain point that I was in a certain kind of atmosphere that had come upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then I began to realize that my speaking was altogether out from the genuine power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whether or not the power in gospel preaching can be sensed by us is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What is vital is that in our gospel preaching we have genuine power.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Along with the elders of the church in Chefoo, I had a definite experience of the Lord s power during a revival that was taking place in the church in 1942.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many of the saints requested the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We laid hands on them one by one and also prayed for each one.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In approximately an hour we prayed for more than two hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The prayer that was uttered during that time was actually one long prayer that continually bubbled forth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What is significant was that the prayer for each saint exactly fit the situation of that saint.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Suddenly the prayer ceased, and we did not lay hands on anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All the attendants at that meeting realized that what had taken place was truly a move of the Spirit and that we could not repeat it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I give this as a further illustration of the fact that our trust for power is in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As we seek to have power and impact in our gospel preaching, we should not follow any strange or peculiar way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Let us take the way of prayer, the way of the Word, and the way of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We believe that today the Lord is the processed Spirit who dwells in us and also upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It does not matter whether this Spirit is sensed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We believe that while we are serving Him and speaking for Him, especially as we are speaking Him forth, He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have the Lord s presence within us as the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Through prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, we can have true power and impact.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I practiced tongue-speaking for a year and a half.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The more I spoke in tongues, the less power I had.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Eventually, I discontinued that practice and came back to the regular way of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Although I did not have much time to kneel down and pray, all day long I had a praying spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>From experience I can testify that prayer brings in power.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Furthermore, throughout the years my ministry has always been with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>During the years I have been preaching and teaching in this country, I have cared only for the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Word is inexhaustible, and the Word is power.</S>
