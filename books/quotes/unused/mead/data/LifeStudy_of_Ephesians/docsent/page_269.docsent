   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE NINETY-THREE THE CORPORATE LIFE OF THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 4:17-32</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that in chapter two we have the creation of the new man and in chapter four, the growth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order for the new man to grow, we need to experience the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and descending Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that the all-inclusive Christ must be wrought into us to be our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then the organically perfect new man will also become perfect functionally.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>GROWING AND FUNCTIONING</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The new man is not perfected mainly by teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Teaching may actually be a frustration to our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before the new man could be created, all the ordinances had to be abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now for the new man to grow, we must be careful about doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ordinances are obstacles to the formation of the new man, and doctrines are frustrations to the growth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I hope that all those who take the lead in the local churches will realize that we should not place our trust in doctrine to produce growth in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Growth only comes through the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The degree to which we can minister Christ is in direct proportion to our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we experience Him, the more we can minister Him to others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we minister Christ, others will be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The very Christ who was crucified and resurrected and who has ascended to the third heaven is now working within us to constitute us into functioning members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He carries out this work by making His home in our hearts and by saturating us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As He saturates us, we are sanctified, purified, nourished, cherished, and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The result is that we become perfected functionally.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way the Body grows and builds itself up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Body is not built directly by the Head or by the gifts mentioned in 4:11; it is built up directly by those members who have been perfected by the gifted ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Concerning this crucial matter, I pray that we all shall have a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I can testify that the sky above me is crystal clear regarding the growth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In these days may the Lord make all His faithful seeking ones transparently clear about the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How blessed we are to be living at a time when the Lord is recovering these things!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ephesians 4 has never been as clear to us as it is in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All those who desire to migrate for the spread of the church life must realize that migration is not a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the move of the one new man, that is, the move of the all-inclusive Christ in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the move of Christ, the heavenly Solomon, in His palanquin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the Lord is to move among us in such a way, we should not function in an individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, we should function in the Body in the way of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to function in this way, we need to experience Christ and to grow in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The measure of our growth will be the sphere, the realm, of our function.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we fail to function, there will be a gap in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if we function excessively, we shall cause a cancer in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the Head of the Body, Christ thoroughly knows the situation of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to His mercy, may the Body be preserved both from any shortage and from cancer caused by overfunction.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We praise the Lord for opening His Word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We thank Him for showing us that the vital need is for Christ to be wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we are saturated with Christ, the more we become in reality parts of the Body with a particular measure of function.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then wherever we may be we shall function properly, and the Body will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This will cause Satan, the enemy of God, to tremble.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It will also hasten the coming back of the Lord Jesus.</S>
