   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIGHT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SENSE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to 1 John 1:5-7 the fellowship of life brings us into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have many experiences of this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On some occasions, when I am talking with my wife about various things, I have a sense that I should go to my study, contact the Lord, and have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I follow this sense, I am brought into the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On other occasions, I may be with my relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since I have a large family, my wife and I are often engaged in polite talks with our relatives who have come to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After about ten minutes of this kind of conversation, I ask my relatives to continue their talk with my wife, but I excuse myself and go away into my study.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Upon entering my study, I first sit down, remain quiet for a period of time, and then begin to pray in order to be brought into the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fellowship immediately brings me into the light, because the One whom I contact is light 1 John 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because He is light, His presence is also light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If I were to remain with my relatives apart from Him, I would not be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, I go away to meet the Lord by having a little time with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I do this, right away I am enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In one recent experience I saw in the light that the words I had spoken to my wife the night before were not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My attitude and the tone of my voice were not in the Spirit; therefore, I was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of experience spontaneously produced a feeling within me that I had to apologize to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I prayed, "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have often prayed that I want to walk, live, and do everything in the Spirit and according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But last night I said something to my wife which I now feel deeply was not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lord, forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I then had a further feeling that I should apologize to my wife and ask for her forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes, I have argued with this feeling and have tried to excuse my behavior, but the feeling persists until I apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Chapter one of 1 John points out the following three crucial things: the divine life v. 2 , fellowship v. 3 , and light vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 7 says, "If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, the light is very close to the inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We walk in the light by the inner feeling of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ephesians 4:18-19 says, "Being darkened in their understanding, estranged from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; who having ceased from feeling have given themselves over to lewdness to work all uncleanness in unbridled greedy lust."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Two very important phrases in these verses are "estranged from the life of God" v. 18 and "having ceased from feeling" v. 19 . The feeling mentioned in verse 19 is the feeling of the conscience, which is the feeling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This feeling in our spirit is strengthened by the presence of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be estranged from the life of God is to stop paying attention to the inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our following of the inner feeling becomes our walk.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The feeling itself is basic, and the walk is secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But our obedience to the feeling becomes our walk.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I felt that I was not in the Spirit when I spoke with my wife, my confession to the Lord and my apology to my wife was my walk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My walk came out of the feeling of life, the sense of life.</S>
