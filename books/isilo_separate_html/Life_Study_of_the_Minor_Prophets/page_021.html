<h1 class="title">JEHOVAH&rsquo;S UNCHANGING LOVE<br />
VERSUS<br />
ISRAEL&rsquo;S STUBBORN UNCHASTITY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hosea 11&mdash;14</h1>
<p>In this message we will begin to consider chapters eleven through fourteen. These chapters are concerned with Jehovah&rsquo;s unchanging love versus Israel&rsquo;s stubborn unchastity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. ISRAEL&rsquo;S STUBBORN UNCHASTITY</h2>
<p>The highest virtue of a proper wife is chastity. A wife may be very good in every respect, but if she is not chaste, she is still not a proper wife. Israel was stubborn in her unchastity toward Jehovah her Husband.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. God&rsquo;s Prophets Calling Them</h2>
<p>God sent the prophets to call Israel again and again, but the more the prophets called them, the farther they went away from the prophets. &ldquo;As they called them, / So they went from them; / To the Baals they sacrificed, / And to the idols they burned incense&rdquo; (11:2). They served the Baals with their offerings of sacrifices.</p>
<p>From the time Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the temple in A.D. 70 until now, God has not raised up any prophets among the Jews. This is God&rsquo;s doing. In Matthew 21:43 the Lord Jesus told the Jews that &ldquo;the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing its fruit.&rdquo; This nation is the church. In the church God has raised up many prophets. Furthermore, in the church every reborn one is a priest (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6). As long as we are children of God, we are priests. In addition to being God&rsquo;s priests serving Him in the gospel (Rom. 15:16), we all need to endeavor to prophesy. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul charged us to desire earnestly to prophesy (vv. 1, 39) and said that we all can prophesy one by one (v. 31). The Lord has shown us that, in His recovery today, He wants to recover 1 Corinthians 14, that is, to recover the prophesying of every believer. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day, after remembering the Lord and worshipping the Father at the Lord&rsquo;s table, all the members of the church should prophesy. This means that they all should speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord. If we all, the young ones and the old ones, prophesy one by one, how rich, how high, how fresh, how living, and how powerful that would be! We all must honor God&rsquo;s ordained way in 1 Corinthians 14. We were regenerated to be priests. Now we need to endeavor to prophesy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. They Refusing to Return to Jehovah</h2>
<p>They would not return to the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian would be their king, for they refused to return to Jehovah. The sword would whirl about in their cities, consume their bars, and devour them because of their own counsels. They were bent upon turning away from Jehovah. Though the prophets called them to Him who is on high, none at all exalted Him (Hosea 11:5-7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Ephraim Encompassing Jehovah with Lies</h2>
<p>Ephraim encompassed Jehovah with lies, and the house of Israel, with deceit (v. 12). When they came to God, they lied. Judah was yet unsteadfast with God and with the Holy One, the Faithful One.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Ephraim Feeding on Wind<br />
and Following the East Wind Continually</h2>
<p>Hosea 12:1 says that Ephraim fed on wind (on vanity and in vain) and followed the east wind continually (in emptiness). He multiplied lies and violence. They made a covenant with Assyria (not with Jehovah), and oil was carried to Egypt (not into the temple of God). This was their situation in their stubborn unchastity.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">E. Jehovah Having Also a Controversy<br />
with Judah and Punishing Jacob<br />
according to His Ways</h2>
<p>Verse 2 tells us that Jehovah had also a controversy with Judah. This means that He was contending, arguing, with Judah. Jehovah would punish Jacob according to his ways. According to his doings He would recompense him. In the womb he grasped his brother by the heel (v. 3a; Gen. 25:26). &ldquo;Jacob fled into the country of Aram; / And Israel served for a wife, / And for a wife he kept sheep&rdquo; (Hosea 12:12; Gen. 29:20, 30; 31:38-41). In his full strength he contended with God (Hosea 12:3b). &ldquo;Indeed he contended with the Angel [Christ] and prevailed; / He wept and made supplication to Him&rdquo; (v. 4a; Gen. 32:24-32).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
