<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Still Having the Resurrected Flesh and Bones after His Resurrection</H2><P>After His resurrection Christ showed His disciples that He still had the resurrected flesh and bones (Luke 24:39; Acts 2:31) of God's new creation (whereas in His incarnation He became the flesh of God's old creation), which will be His body of glory when He comes back (Phil. 3:21). In the night of His resurrection, Christ came back to the disciples. The disciples thought He was a spirit or a ghost. However, He told them to touch Him. This was not His original flesh, but the resurrected flesh and bones of God's new creation. His physical body was of God's old creation. His resurrected body is of God's new creation. His resurrected body will be His body of glory when He returns. At that time we also will be transfigured to be the same in body as He is, that is, we will be conformed to the body of His glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Christ's Ministry in the Flesh</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Bringing God into Man</H2><P>As the Word becoming the flesh, He brought God into man, making God one with man (John 1:1, 14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Manifesting God</H2><P>First Timothy 3:16 says that Christ was God manifested in the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Condemning Sin</H2><P>Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin to condemn sin (Rom. 8:3b). Sin is in the flesh of sin. Christ died not only for the sins in our conduct but also to condemn the sin in our nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Being Put to Death for Our Sins</H2><P>Christ was put to death for our sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous (1 Pet. 3:18).</P>
