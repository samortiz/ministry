   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seed of the woman would bruise the head of Satan, the seed of Abraham would become a blessing to all the nations on the earth, and the seed of David would be the Son of God to build up the temple and to rule in God's kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's becoming a man means that God mingles divinity with humanity, making God and man, divinity and humanity, one entity.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>and of a Human Virgin</S>
