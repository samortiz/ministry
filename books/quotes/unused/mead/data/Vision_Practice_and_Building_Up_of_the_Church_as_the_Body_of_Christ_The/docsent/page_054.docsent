   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED TO LEARN THE LESSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT TO ADJUST OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BUT TO HELP THEM IN A POSITIVE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I first learned this lesson when I stayed with Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I watched and observed how he conducted himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He never made differing proposals to a local church, and he never adjusted or corrected them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He once told me, Brother Lee, what good is it to adjust others?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the whole earth we cannot find one group of Christians that was ever successfully adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is impossible to adjust others, and it is foolish to try.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consider yourself as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Are you willing to be adjusted?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If someone is driving a car, he does not want someone else to be a backseat driver.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To say nothing about someone else s driving means that we have learned the proper lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Someone who is patient about everything else may be unable to be patient with a backseat driver.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That is why Watchman Nee told me that it is foolish to adjust others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not one person on this earth wants to be adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He said, Brother Lee, be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The wisest thing is to let people go.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then they will learn the lesson, and later they will come back to ask you for help.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was a learner under Brother Nee s hand at that time, but many times when I saw the things happening around us, I was unable to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I asked him, Do you agree with this?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why don t you speak a word about it?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you say something, people will receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Nee replied, You are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if the Lord Jesus came to speak a word, they would not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You should not try to be higher than the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let them go their way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day they will learn the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have come to realize that this is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot help others by adjusting them; we can only create problems in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we adjust people, we will never see a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will see only a loss to others and to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we go to a certain place to minister, we should always remember to avoid adjusting people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then our ministry will be preserved, and we will not be involved in problems.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will keep a position to minister something positive, and our ministry will not be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>People will not be troubled by us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, what they receive from us will be something positive as a gain and a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if we do adjust people, sooner or later we will damage them and our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The doors for our ministry will be closed, and we will lose our position to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more we try to adjust people, the more we lose our credit with them, and they will have no confidence in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we avoid adjusting others and always help them positively, we will build up a strong confidence among them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will help them and us also.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>RESPECTING THE SITUATION IN A LOCAL CHURCH AND SEEKING AN OPENING TO MINISTER TO THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Wherever we go, we need to recognize the facts of history, respect the present situation in that place, and go along with the church in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then perhaps an opening will be prepared for us to minister something further.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Still, we need to be very wise and careful, always on the alert not to create trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Scriptures show us the principle that the building of the house of God requires peace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>David was unable to carry out the building of the temple because in his time there was no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When there is no peace and harmony, it is impossible to build up the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not try to say who is right and who is wrong about an issue.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as we create trouble, we may be right in doctrine, but we are wrong in our way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we have said, if we go to a place where dichotomy is taught, we should not speak against it, and we should not insist on trichotomy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if certain ones who teach dichotomy come to our locality, they also should recognize the facts and respect the present situation among us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the past three years the Lord has raised up a church here through the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This ministry cannot avoid speaking about trichotomy, because we have learned and experienced this fact, and it is through this ministry that the church here has been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, those who come to us should recognize the situation with the church and the ministry, whether or not they agree with trichotomy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They should not speak against trichotomy, but they should go along with the church here in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There will still be many opportunities to help the church by ministering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They can help the church to preach the gospel, for example.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There will always be openings for a positive ministering.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are forty-five minutes for speaking after the Lord s table meeting every Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If someone has an abundance of life in Christ, and he is very much in the spirit, he may take five minutes to stand and speak a word to minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is no need to say trichotomy is wrong and dichotomy is right.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He may simply minister something of the love of Christ, our love toward Christ, and the way to fellowship with the Lord and touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this way he will enrich the meeting without raising up any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He will be a witness of light and life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If someone has learned something of Christ in his spirit and has a real surplus of Christ, he can offer a prayer in the Lord s table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In only a few minutes the whole congregation can be helped.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once when Brother Nee attended the Keswick Convention, he was asked to offer a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That prayer uplifted the entire congregation to the extent that no one paid attention to the message afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After the meeting everyone talked about that prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This illustrates that even one prayer can help people very much.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we have a portion of Christ, there is no need to try to change the way of a church in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can still minister what we have gained of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Even if there is no opening for ministering in the meeting, we can still visit the brothers in their homes, not to speak something different from the teaching in that place but to minister life to everyone in every family.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In this way we will edify, build up, and enrich the church.</S>
