THE REAL FULFILLMENT OF THE SIGN<br>GIVEN BY GOD TO AHAZ, THE KING OF JUDAH,<br>BEING THE LORD'S INCARNATION</H2><P>The sign in Isaiah 7:14 has had both an actual fulfillment and a real fulfillment. As we have seen, the actual fulfillment was the birth of a son by Isaiah's wife. The real fulfillment of the sign given by God to Ahaz, king of Judah, was the Lord's incarnation (Matt. 1:20-23), which issued in Immanuel, that is, God with us, for the salvation of God's people. All God's people, those who are of Israel and those who are of the church, are saved by Immanuel.</P><P>Immanuel is all-inclusive. He includes the Savior, the Redeemer, the Life-giver, and the all-inclusive Spirit. Immanuel is first our Savior, then our Redeemer, then our Life-giver, and then the all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit. We need to realize that the all-inclusive Spirit is Immanuel. On the one hand, this all-inclusive Spirit is the Shoot of Jehovah; on the other hand, He is the Fruit of the earth (Isa. 4:2). He is God and man. Such a one is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. CHRIST AS IMMANUEL</H2><P>In Isaiah 8:9-22 we have a revelation concerning Christ as Immanuel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. For One to Overcome the Nations<br>in Their Equipping, Counseling, and Speaking</H2><P>Christ as Immanuel is for one to overcome the nations in their equipping, counseling, and speaking (vv. 9-10). God is with the one who thus overcomes; He is his Immanuel. The last part of verse 10 says, "For God is with us." The words God is with us are a translation of the Hebrew expression immanu El.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. For One to Be Instructed by Jehovah</H2><P>Christ as Immanuel is also for one to be instructed by Jehovah not to walk in the way of this people, not to be in their conspiracy, and not to fear what they fear, nor be awed by what they are awed by (vv. 11-12). Because the people had become degraded, the one instructed by Jehovah was not to follow them. Rather, this one was to sanctify Jehovah of hosts, regarding Him as the One to fear and the One to be awed by (v. 13).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
