   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Leading concerning the Way in the Service</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being a Corporate Matter</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Acts is a book on the leading concerning the way in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only this book tells us the way the Holy Spirit led men in their works.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this book, it mentions the Lord's approving and His disapproving as well.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In some places it says that the Holy Spirit said this and said that, and in other places it says that Timothy and Titus were assigned to this and that place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In addition, the Epistles to Timothy and Titus are also epistles on the work, and they follow the same principle as Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From Acts and these Epistles we can see that there is the side of individual leading, and there is the side of corporate leading.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the majority of the leadings there are corporate leadings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Acts 2, when Peter stood up, the other eleven stood up with him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What Peter said became the words of all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He told the crowd to be baptized for the washing away of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After his word, no one said anything more.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John did not stand up and say, "Peter, save some room for me to speak."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The failure of Catholicism lies in the fact that it does not give any place to the conscience and does not give any place to the reality of the Holy Spirit; the church becomes the highest monopolizing institution.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The recovery of Protestantism is the recovery of the individual.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, because it is a recovery of the individual, anything that has to do with the leading of the way of the church is solved by committees, votes, and resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, real leading does not come through committees, resolutions, and debates, but in a spontaneous, unorchestrated, yet harmonious way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where there is the reality of the Spirit, there will be no problem with the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The real leading is produced under the oneness of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts tells us that when there was need among the churches in Samaria, Jerusalem sent men to help them Acts 8:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the few brothers in the church in Antioch prayed, the Holy Spirit set apart two of them for His work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If it were up to us, we would have much consideration about the way to spread to Europe and the way to work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, Acts shows us that it is not a matter of consideration, but a matter of the corporate leading.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Leading Being a Matter in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the time of Paul's conversion, even God's speaking to him was through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord spoke to Paul not only directly, but through the members also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why did the Lord have to speak to Paul through others?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I have something to say to Brother Yu-chi, I can say it to him directly; I do not have to convey it through another person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But here was Paul, who was zealous in serving God, who shed others' blood and thought that by so doing he was serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day, God cast a great light on him and turned his life around.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why would the Lord not speak to such a person directly?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He sent others to speak to him instead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moreover, He did not send Peter, John, or Philip, but He sent Ananias.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one had heard of Ananias before that time or after that time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord sent a seemingly ordinary believer to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows us that leading is a matter of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God Speaking to the Whole Body</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John's ministry is on God's house, Peter's ministry is on God's kingdom, and Paul's ministry is on God's church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With Paul, we see that from the first day on, he touched something, which is the oneness of the Lord with His church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Head is one with the members, and the members are one with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul learned these two lessons right from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He saw the life of the Body from the first day on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why he was able to drop his self and to accept the commission of the work, and later to be able to commission others in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This shows us that God's speaking is not directed toward individuals, but toward the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Rejection of the Leading in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Being the Rejection of All Leadings</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to ask God to do one thing today: If a person rejects the leading in the Body, he will be deprived of all leadings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord's leading in the work is manifested in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we pay our attention to our individual ways, we will miss God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whether it is the work or the services, everything is carried out in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>An individual can do something, but what he does is different from what the Body can do.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The work of an individual is fragmentary, and it is not related to God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Works whose basis is the individual are either empty or unsubstantial.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a man stands on the right ground, he has the right works to do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If he does not stand on the right ground, even if he does some works, his works are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A man can be very busy, but in God's eyes, he can be very idle.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>An idle person is not one who has nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>An idle person is one whose work does not count in the Lord's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When I have no part in God's work and God does not recognize what I do, when I am only busy doing my own works instead, I am an idle person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A man can be very busy, yet still miss the Lord and see Him passing him by.</S>
