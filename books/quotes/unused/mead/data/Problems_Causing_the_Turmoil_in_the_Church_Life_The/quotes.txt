[1]  The Problems Causing the Turmoil in the Church Life CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE TURMOIL AND THE COMFORT PRACTICING THE GENERALITY OF THE CHURCH LIFE
[3]  The Lord s recovery came to us through Brother Watchman Nee.
[4]  At the beginning of the Lord s recovery in the United States in Elden Hall, Pentecostal people sometimes came among us and spoke in tongues.
[5]  But to carry out God s commission and the Lord s leading, we have to be faithful to discern what we should take and what we should not take, what we should go on with and what we should not go on with.
[6]  In this fellowship I would like to share with you the intrinsic problems among us.
[7]  At this point I am burdened to share something with you concerning the real history among us in the Lord s recovery.
[8]  THE INTRINSIC PROBLEMS AMONG US Not Recognizing God s Speaking
[9]  The first of the problems today among us is concerning the recognition of God s speaking.
[10]  We do not stress and practice the crucial points of the basic truths in the Lord s recovery, such as the experience of the processed Divine Trinity, the enjoyment of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ, the full and adequate application of the consummated, all-inclusive Spirit, the strict attention to the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, the proper practice of the local churches on the proper local ground, etc. This is the fatal weakness in our practice of the Lord s recovery.
[11]  CHAPTER THREE THE NEED TO SEE THE BODY OF CHRIST
[12]  Most of the saints among us really love the Lord, but the problem is with their seeing of the divine vision.
[13]  In the recovery we need not merely the knowing but the seeing of a revelation, which has to become a vision to us.
[14]  Verses 7 through 16 of Ephesians 4 go on to reveal the functioning of the gifts to perfect the saints to do the work of the ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ, and they unveil the growth and building up of the Body of Christ.
[15]  Have you noticed that today in the entire realm of Christianity, including Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, the word economy is not being used?
[16]  Christ as God s expression through the church which is His Body is the central thought of the whole Scripture.
[17]  The Triune God is embodied and crystallized in the New Jerusalem, and this is the consummation of the Body of Christ, the counterpart of Christ, the wife of Christ, the organism of the Triune God.
[18]  God the Father is there as the shining One Rev 22:5 , Christ is there as the tree of life v. 2 , and the Spirit is there as the river of water of life v. 1 . God is the shining One, Christ is the growing One, and the Spirit is the flowing One.
[19]  In the recent turmoil, some began to teach different things other than God s economy 1 Tim 1:3-4 .
[20]  Just as no part of our human body can be autonomous in relation to the other parts, none of the churches of the Body of Christ can be autonomous in relation to the other churches.
[21]  Ephesians tells us clearly that the church, the gathering of God s called-out ones, is not an organization but an organism, the Body of Christ.
[22]  When we do something, we must not forget that we are members of the Body, and the Body is not only a local church.
[23]  The Body is the Body of Christ, constituted by the Triune God with all the believers on this earth, with all the local churches.
[24]  The Lord desires to recover the missed Body of Christ and to recover the neglected oneness of the Body of Christ.
[25]  CHAPTER FOUR A CONCLUDING WORD THE MUTUAL PROFIT BETWEEN THE BODY
[26]  We need to see the profit of the Body to the local churches and the profit of the local churches to the Body.
[27]  Some among us enjoyed the inheritance from the Body, but then they gave up the Body and would not care for the Body.
[28]  Those who took the lead in the recent turmoil did not care for the Body.
[29]  The overcomers see the Body, know the Body, and care for the Body.
