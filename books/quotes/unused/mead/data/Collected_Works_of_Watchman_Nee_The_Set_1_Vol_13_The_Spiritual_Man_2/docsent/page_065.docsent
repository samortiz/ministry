   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPER USE OF EMOTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If a believer allows the cross to do a deeper work in his emotion, he would soon learn that the emotion would not obstruct the spirit, but would even cooperate with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The cross would deal with all the natural life of the emotion, renew it, and make it an instrument of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have previously mentioned that a spiritual man is not a spirit, nor is he a man without emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the contrary, he uses his emotion to express the divine life within him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before being dealt with by God, the emotion cannot be an instrument of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, it acts according to its own desire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After being cleansed, the emotion can be an organ to express the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The spirit likewise expresses its life through the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The spirit needs the emotion to express its love and feelings towards man's suffering; it also needs the emotion to cause man to sense the operation of intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sense of the spirit is made known to man through the feeling of his quiet emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the emotion obeys the spirit, it causes the spirit to love what God loves and hate what He hates.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After understanding the truth concerning not living according to the emotion, some believers mistakenly think that a spiritual life is a life void of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They think we need to abolish emotion so that we can be without emotion, like wood or stone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a believer does not understand the meaning of the death of the cross, he cannot know the meaning of delivering the emotion to death and living entirely according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are not saying that the believer should become exceedingly hard, like iron or rock; nor should he be without affection in order to be considered a spiritual man, as if the term "spiritual man" denotes a man without affection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the contrary, the most tender, sympathetic, merciful, and loving person is a spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Being entirely spiritual and delivering the emotion to the cross do not mean that a believer will lose his emotion and become emotionless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we see how a spiritual believer's love is greater than that of others, we will know that a spiritual man is not without emotion; rather, his emotion differs from that of an ordinary man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In delivering our soul to the cross, we must remember that the life of the soul is lost, not the function of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To nail the function of the soul on the cross would mean that we no longer think, decide, or feel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must always remember this fact: losing the soul is to solely and continuously live by the life of God, not living by the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is being willing to not live according to self or walk according to the pleasure of the self, but to submit to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moreover, the cross and resurrection are two inseparable facts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection" Rom 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The death of the cross does not mean annihilation; the emotion, mind, and will of the soul-life are not exterminated by passing through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They only lose their natural life in the death of the Lord; they are resurrected in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Death and resurrection cause the functioning organs of the soul to lose their life and then cause them to be renewed and used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Consequently, a spiritual man is not without emotion; rather, his emotion is the most perfect and noble; it is as if it were newly created by God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If anyone has difficulty here, the problem lies in his theory because no problem exists in his spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Emotion must pass through the work of the cross Matt 10:38-39 in order to get rid of its fiery nature, fanaticism, and confusion and to be totally subject to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The goal of the work of the cross is for the spirit to have the authority to regulate the function of the emotion.</S>
