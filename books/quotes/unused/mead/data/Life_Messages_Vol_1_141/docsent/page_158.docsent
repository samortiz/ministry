   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE THE REVELATION OF LIFE AND THE WAY TO TAKE CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Even though we know that the Bible is a book of life and that Christ is life, to some extent we are still short of the revelation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A SURVEY OF LIFE IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why is it that the Bible begins and ends with the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After creating man, God put him in a garden in which was the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From this picture it is clear that the man created in God's own image did not have the life signified by that tree.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can also see that it was God's intention for man to have that life, rather than only his human life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are several kinds of life mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Besides the divine life and the human life, there are also the animal life and the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's life is the highest and the plant life the lowest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Further, within us as human beings there are three kinds of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The physical life is called bios Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>; the psychological life, psuche; and the divine, eternal life, zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God created us with the bios life for our body and the psuche life for our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a person dies, it is the bios which ceases; the psuche lives on.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God did not put the divine life into man when he was created.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, He gave man a free will that he might choose the divine life, symbolized by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we know, man did not so choose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then the Lord Jesus came.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Gospel of John He is described as the Word and as God, and then we are told, "In Him was life" 1:1, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I used to wonder what the tree of life was.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I was familiar with lots of different trees, but the tree of life I did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In time I came to realize that the tree of life is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John 1 mentions life but not the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when you come to John 15 there is the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A grapevine is not useful in providing lumber for building, nor is it good for burning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is only good for life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By bringing John 1 and John 15 together, we have the tree of life, the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said, "I am the life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly" 14:6; 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He also told us that He is the bread of life 6:35 and has the water of life 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The bread of life is good for eating, the water of life for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is also called the Prince of life Acts 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word translated prince could also be translated originator or author.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However we translate it, it indicates that life pertains to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Epistles there is the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , the word of life Phil 2:16 , and Christ our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From all these verses we can see that life is a Person, not a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose in a meeting people are jumping up and shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Would this be an indication that they are full of life?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If so, there is more life at a ball game because more shouting and jumping go on there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jumping is not life, though life may jump.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jumping is a condition; life is a Person, Christ our life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the end of the Bible the first promise to the overcomers is, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God" Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here the tree of life comes into view again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then the picture in the last chapter includes the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the holy city there is a river flowing out of the throne of God; on either side of the banks of the river is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I used to wonder how a tree could grow on two banks, but once I realized this tree is a vine I could see how it would spread to both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This tree grows in the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you get into the water, you get the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, the last invitation in the Bible is, "Let him who is thirsty also come; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely" 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The one who takes the water of life will surely have the tree of life also, because the tree is included in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is the implication that it grows in the water of life.</S>
