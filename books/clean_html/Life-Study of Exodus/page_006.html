<h2 class="head3">1. Rich in Material Supply<br />and Full of Physical Enjoyment and Pleasure</h2><p>The exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt represents another aspect. Egypt signifies the world of enjoyment, the world of pleasure. Those who are involved with this aspect of the world are not ensnared primarily by rebellion or idolatry; they are fully occupied by pleasure, by the rich material supply and physical enjoyment of the world (Gen. 12:10; 42:1; Num. 11:4-5). The river Nile, which irrigates the land of Egypt, makes the land rich in produce. When the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, they said, &ldquo;We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic&rdquo; (Num. 11:5). All these items represent the material riches of the world for enjoyment and pleasure.</p><p>Before we were saved, we were not only in the world of rebellion and idolatry, but also in the world of riches and enjoyment. Abraham was called out of the rebellious world, but the children of Israel made their exodus out of the world of enjoyment. Egypt was rich not only in food supply but also in gold. This is proved by the fact that the Egyptians gave gold to the Israelites at the time of the exodus.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Usurping the People<br />Whom God Had Created and Chosen<br />for His Purpose</h2><p>The world typified by Egypt usurps the people whom God created and chose for His purpose (5:6-9). The children of Israel were enslaved to that aspect of the world which gave them their livelihood and afforded them their enjoyment. Whether they are rich or poor, many today are slaves to money. They work hard to earn a large amount of money and then in a short time they spend all they have to indulge in the pleasures of the world. Thus many today do not serve God, but mammon. This was the situation among the ancient Israelites in the land of Egypt. In Egypt they made a good living and they enjoyed the riches of the world. But Egypt kept them from fulfilling the purpose for which God had originally called them.</p><p>In Egypt the children of Israel became strong. Exodus 1:7 says, &ldquo;And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew strong exceedingly; and the land was filled with them&rdquo; (Heb.). In one sense, to become strong is to become rich. Without money, a nation cannot be strong. For example, the United States is a strong nation because of its economy.</p><p>The children of Israel enjoyed the aspect of the world typified by Egypt. They were not in the first aspect of the world, typified by Babel, nor in the second aspect, represented by Sodom. But they were enslaved in the third aspect, signified by Egypt. Because they were occupied by the riches and enjoyment of the world, they were kept from fulfilling the purpose for which God had created and chosen them. In the same principle, all the worldly people today have been usurped by Satan. As a result, they do not know God&rsquo;s purpose. How we need to thank the Lord for delivering us from slavery in the world and for setting us free from the usurping hand of Satan!</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Children of Israel<br />Falling into Egyptian Tyranny</h2><p>Because of their need to maintain their livelihood, the children of Israel fell into Egyptian tyranny (1:10-11). The worldly people today are also under tyranny. Even their occupation with worldly amusements is a sign that they are under Satan&rsquo;s tyranny. Forced to follow a course that holds them under Satan&rsquo;s tyranny and that keeps them from God&rsquo;s purpose, they have no freedom and do not make the proper choices.</p>
