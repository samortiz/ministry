   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning to Nourish as a Mother and Lead as a Father</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, we must learn to nourish.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we go to lead a home meeting, we are not just attending a meeting but are leading and taking care of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other words, they are our children, so we must feed and nurse them as a mother and also teach and exhort them as a father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must bear all their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some might refuse to do this, saying, "I cannot bear the problems even in my own family, so how can I bear the problems of two other families?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I dare not speak about any other matter, but concerning this matter I have much experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was young, the Lord uprooted me from the world and gave me a heavy burden every day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It has been fifty-four years now.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may think that we would be able to relax if we could lay our burden down, but we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we reject the Lord's burden, then Satan, the king of the world, will put his burden on us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you ask me what you should do, my answer is this: The Lord is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You should go to Him to seek and rely on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the more burdens we receive from the Lord, the more blessings we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When our burdens are gone, the Lord's blessing will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Two years ago there were more than six hundred churches in the Lord's recovery around the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now we have increased to almost nine hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the past three months we have gained six thousand people through our door-knocking and have established two thousand home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This, too, is the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, when the Lord gives us a burden, He also gives us a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The question is whether or not we are willing to receive the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we receive the Lord's burden, we will also receive His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we wish to not be busy, to have no burdens, or to spend our days in a leisurely way, then we will live our days without the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our attitude should be that we are not afraid of being busy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We only fear not having "children."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Bearing children is a heavy burden, yet it also brings much blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we should not be afraid; rather, we should pick up the burden to care for our "children."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Practically Caring for the Needs of the New Ones</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Third, we must practically care for the needs of the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the past we did not place much emphasis on such things as the so-called healing of the sick and casting out of demons; however, these things are definitely in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes when we go out to preach the gospel and lead people to be saved and baptized, some of them will have this kind of need, and we should care for them in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no need for us to go out purposely to do these things, nor should we be too passive, but always seeking the so-called leading.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The principle of the matter lies with "whenever."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever someone has a demon, we should cast the demon out; whenever someone is sick, we should heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not be afraid when you meet a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You should just cast him out boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you meet with illness, do not be worried, just lay your hands on the sick one and pray, seeking the Lord's leading to heal the sick one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible clearly says that the Lord bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows Isa 53:4-5; Matt 8:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is our great Physician, who is able to heal all our illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever we meet people with these needs, we should do these things to serve them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although it is wrong to care just for these things, it is also a shortcoming and a mistake to intentionally avoid doing them.</S>
