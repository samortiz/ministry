   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Regenerate the Believers for His Body</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The third great thing accomplished by Christ in the stage of His inclusion was that He regenerated the believers for His Body 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>a. To Regenerate the Believers, Making Them the Many Sons of God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The purpose of Christ's being begotten to be the firstborn Son of God and becoming the life-giving Spirit was to regenerate the believers that they may become the many sons of God, born of God with Him in the one universally big delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the birth of Christ in resurrection was indeed a big delivery, one delivery giving birth to millions of sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first One was the firstborn Son, Christ, and the rest were the many sons, all the believers belonging to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is for the composition of the house of God, even the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is also for the constitution of the Body of Christ to be His fullness, His expression and expansion, to consummate the eternal expression and expansion of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning the constitution of the Body of Christ, 1Corinthians 12:13 says that in one Spirit all the believers have been baptized into the one Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This one Spirit is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Him as the one Spirit we all have been baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the same time, all the believers who were baptized in the one Spirit have been given to drink this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be baptized is to enter into the one Spirit, whereas to drink is to receive the one Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The people in the region of the lower course of the Yangtze River in China had the habit of going in the morning to drink tea at the tea house and going at night to bathe by soaking in the pool.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the morning they drank to their full, and at night they soaked in the pool.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They said that to soak in the pool was to have "the water enveloping the skin" and to drink to one's full was to have "the skin enveloping the water"; that is, there was water both inside and outside.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This should be our condition today since we have been baptized into the Spirit and have been given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have been baptized into Christ as the life-giving Spirit this is "the Spirit enveloping us."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, we have been given to drink the Spirit this is "us enveloping the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consequently, we have the Spirit within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, in this Spirit, we all become one organic entity the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Giving the Spirit without Measure</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In His resurrection Christ gave Himself as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit without measure through His speaking of the words of God John 3:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today people in the Pentecostal movement claim that if you have received the baptism of the Spirit, you must speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the Bible says that when you receive the words of God and the words of God enter into you, you have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 6:63 the Lord told us, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once we receive the words of God into us, these words that are in us become spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, when the Lord speaks to us, He gives us life and the Spirit without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I truly can testify that the more I receive the Lord's words, the more I am filled with the Spirit, even without measure.</S>
