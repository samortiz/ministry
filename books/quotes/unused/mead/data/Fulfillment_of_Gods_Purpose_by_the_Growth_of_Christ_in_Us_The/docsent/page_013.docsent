   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE INCREASE OF CHRIST WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we have to go on to see something positive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The real growth is the growth of God, the increase of God, within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Colossians 2:19 says that we grow with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all have God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That means we all have Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But how much of Christ do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should have Christ as the very God filling up our entire being, so we all need to grow with the growth of God, the increase of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God needs to be increased within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more increase of God we have, the more growth we have.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can have Christ increased within us by calling on His name, praying to Him, and pray-reading His word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we will grow up into Christ in all things, not just in some things Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to have the increase of God day by day so that we may grow up into Christ in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now you are in Christ, but not in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are in Christ just in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In so many things, you are not in Christ yet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the negative side, we should not be the wayside, the stony ground, or the thorny ground; we need to be the good ground, without worldly traffic, without the hidden stones, without the cares of this age, the deceitfulness of mammon, and without the desire for other things which choke the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to be the good ground, freed from all kinds of preoccupations that we may have the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we will have the increase of God to grow up into Christ in all things.</S>
