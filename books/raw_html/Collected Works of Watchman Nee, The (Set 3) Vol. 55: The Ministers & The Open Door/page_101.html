        <h2 class="head2">A Terrible Suffering Indeed!</h2><p>Physically, I still need to rest another week, according to Brother Deh-bao's word; it is still too early to move around. If you think I need to go to Yungkang, I believe the Lord will protect and support me. I await your letter with instructions.</p><p>I do not know when you think it will be appropriate for me to return to Jinhua. I feel that my condition before the Lord is terrible both inwardly and outwardly! I believe that I have been going steadily downward on this trip from Jinhua to Hangchow. I feel a great darkness inwardly and outwardly. I cannot touch the Lord when I try to fellowship with Him. Sometimes I wonder if my spiritual pathway has reached its end. Do I still have a hope of rising up again? I do not know why I feel as if I have committed some great sin. The things which I thought were no longer with me (the things of the old creation) are still in me. The things which I thought I had (in the new creation) have completely disappeared. I do not know where they have gone. Sometimes I am so discouraged and disappointed that I hate myself. What kind of a person am I? I do not have any spiritual reality, and I have touched nothing of service. I can do nothing, but I am full of pride. When others do something well, I am jealous. I cannot tolerate a single critical sentence or attitude from others. I am weak and pitiful inwardly. It is beyond me to describe my present condition! Sometimes I really cannot stand it, and my uneasiness all too clearly shows where I am! It is a terrible suffering indeed!</p><p>I have no words to pray to the Lord concerning this condition. I want to cry, but have no tears. Therefore, I am really afraid to return to Jinhua. I used to think that I could handle everything and that I could solve the brothers' and sisters' problems. Now I do not even know how to solve my own problems. But if I do not return to Jinhua, what is the use of my staying in Hangchow? Sometimes I think it is useless for me to be anywhere. I am like salt that has lost its flavor. Sometimes I tell myself, "It is futile to serve any longer!" But I am not willing to quit. In this kind of condition, I really cannot receive any leading. Perhaps I do not need to seek any leading by myself. Wherever you put me is fine. If you think I need to return to Jinhua, I will return to Jinhua. I feel that I can do nothing. If you want me to go back to Jinhua, please give me a little time to study more about optometry. What do you think about this?</p><p>Beginning Monday, a few brothers began praying together every morning. I believe Brother Chao has probably written to you about this. The first two times were very oppressive; we were not able to release ourselves; nor could we sense what to pray. We could only confess our sins and pray for our hopeless condition. We did not touch the spirit at all, nor did we rise up inwardly. Each of us was there looking at the pitiful condition of the self. The more we prayed like this, the lower we sank, and the more we were oppressed! By the third morning, there was almost no prayer. This continued until Brother Chao prayed a few words about faith. He prayed about coming before God by faith. When he touched this point, everybody opened up inwardly. We turned and began to lift our praises to Christ for all of His accomplishments. We stopped looking at ourselves. We looked at Christ! He is our everything! We are not accepted before God based on ourselves; nor do we boast about ourselves before the enemy. We do not overcome the flesh in ourselves. Here we touched some praise in the spirit. It is unfortunate that we had turned back to our "self." The Lord showed us once again that we are fallen, that our heart is wicked, and that we cannot be used by God. We asked the Lord to give us deeper dealings. Please remember us in prayer, and protect us with your prayers.</p><p>Sisters Wu and Kwei went to Changloh; they will return to Hangchow in twenty days. (They have already returned to Hangchow.&mdash;Editor)</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Jien-bang<br />September 28, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: c/o 48 Gang-Er Alley, Hangchow</p>

            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
