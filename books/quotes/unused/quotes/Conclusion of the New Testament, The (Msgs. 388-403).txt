In this message we will begin to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in 2 Peter
The riches of Christ that are unveiled in Peter's two Epistles reveal all the divine elements of God's salvation
Peter 1:1 tells us that in the righteousness of Christ as our God and Savior, we 'have been allotted faith equally precious as ours'
When He lived, walked, and worked on earth as a man, He did everything righteously; all His acts, deeds, and works were righteous
In 2 Peter 1:1 two kinds of righteousness-the righteousness of God and the righteousness of Christ-are put together
It is in the sphere of and by means of this twofold righteousness that the precious faith has been allotted equally to all believers
Peter's word concerning the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ, is rich in what it indicates and implies
The common thought among the Jews at Peter's time was that God gave them certain blessings for their enjoyment
The righteousness of God is versus our own righteousness, and the righteousness of Christ is versus the righteousness of the law
As long as we have this gift, we have the lot of God's inheritance, for living faith equals the lot of God's inheritance
Peter had the same view in mind when he in 2 Peter 1:1 spoke of our being allotted faith equally precious as ours
The good land, the portion of the children of Israel in Old Testament times, typifies the all-inclusive Christ
As the good land was the portion of the Old Testament saints, so Christ is the portion of the New Testament believers
In the Old Testament the good land was allotted to the twelve tribes, and in the New Testament precious faith is allotted to us
In 2 Peter 1:1 faith is not considered as a means but an allotment, a portion of the New Testament inheritance allotted to us by God
The issue of the faith produced within us is that whatever Christ is according to the word of the New Testament is imparted to us
When in our experience our response and the Christ conveyed to us through the preaching of the Word become one, faith is produced within us
In the Old Testament the land of Canaan was the unique good land allotted by God as an inheritance to His people Israel
At the juncture when we believed, it was we who were believing, but it was God who was allotting a portion of the unique faith into us
It is impossible for any man to believe in the mystery and centrality of the gospel of God by his natural life
It is impossible for us to truly not believe, even though we may occasionally deny Him, because the precious faith given to us is in us
The substance of the New Testament blessings is invisible, abstract, and mysterious; it cannot be felt by our emotion or be seen by our eyes
We cannot see the divine life by our natural sight, nor can we sense or touch the divine life by our natural feeling
If we have the divine faith as our allotted portion, we have all the reality of God's New Testament economy with all its blessings
Faith is also the substantiation of the substance of the truth , which is the reality of the contents of God's New Testament economy
Such a faith is allotted to all the believers in Christ as their portion, which is equally precious to all who have received it
It brings all the contents of its substantiation into us, thus making them all, with itself , subjective to us in our experience
When the light brings the scenery to the film within the camera, both the seeing and the scenery become subjective to the camera
The Bible is not merely a book of doctrine; it is a revelation of the truth, which is the reality of the content of God's economy
Grace is the enjoyment of our portion of the New Testament inheritance, which is actually the processed Triune God
Grace and peace come to us in a sphere and by a particular means-the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
The full knowledge of the Triune God is for our participation in and enjoyment of His divine life and divine nature
The Greek word rendered 'full knowledge' is composed of the word gnosis plus the prefix epi, which means 'upon'
The full knowledge of God and of Christ is a deep, practical, thorough, and experiential knowledge of God and our Lord
Grace and peace came to us through the God-allotted faith, which substantiates the life-blessing of the New Testament
Peter says in verse 2 that grace and peace are multiplied 'in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord'
In a very real sense we the believers do know God and Jesus but we need to realize that our knowledge of God and of Jesus may be inadequate
Multiplication of grace and peace within us is according to the increase of our knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ
We must have the full knowledge of God and Jesus Christ in order that grace and peace in us would be multiplied
We have seen that grace is multiplied as His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness
In this message we will continue to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as our God and Savior
God as the divine power passed through creation, redemption, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
The one man Jesus could die on behalf of all men to accomplish an eternal redemption because of the divine power
They include the law of life humility wisdom rejoicing love joy hope submission goodness meekness kindness longsuffering and peace
Within the power of the divine life as the seed in us are all the things necessary for the growth of the divine life
The divine power, the power of life, includes all things needed not only for life inwardly but also for godliness outwardly
How much more power was necessary to raise Christ to the third heaven, to the center and height of the universe!
In 2 Peter 1:3, Peter says that this divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness
Life is the inward energy, the inward strength, to bring forth the outward godliness, which leads to and results in glory
All things have been given, imparted, and infused into us so that we may live the divine life and also live out this life
The imparting into us of all the things of life is through the full knowledge of God, which is conveyed and revealed to us through His word
If we have the full knowledge of the One who has called us to His glory and virtue, we will not waste our time gossiping
If we do not pass through the process to gain the full knowledge, it will seem that what the divine power has planted in us has been in vain
There is the need for us to be trained by the Lord so that we may gain the full knowledge of the One who has called us
Peter does not say that God has called us to heaven, nor even that He has called us to redemption or sanctification
We definitely need the full knowledge of the One who has called us for the purpose of bringing us into His glory and virtue
Although we have been called into God's glory and virtue, are we actually in this glory, and are we participating in this virtue?
All these promises are being carried out in His believers by His life-power as the excellent virtue, unto His glory
According to 2 Peter 1:3, the Lord has called us not only by His glory and virtue but also to His glory and virtue
They saw the Lord's glory at other times as well, for example, when He fed the five thousand and when He called Lazarus out of the tomb
The disciples were in a situation that was full of glory and full of virtue, the glory and virtue to which they had been called
Because we all have been called to glory and virtue, God has given us promises in order that He may work out this virtue and glory for us
As those who have received equally precious faith, we, the believers in Christ, should be partakers of the divine nature
The divine nature refers to what God is, that is, the riches, the elements, and the constituents of God's being
The divine life and the divine nature are inseparable; the divine nature is the substance of the divine life and is within the divine life
As the children of God, we are God-men, born of God, possessing the life and nature of God, and belonging to the species of God
Because the divine nature is in the divine life, the divine life with which we were born again has the divine nature within it
Through incarnation Christ put humanity upon Himself and thereafter had two natures, the divine nature and the human nature
On the one hand, the New Testament reveals that the Godhead is unique and that only God, who alone has the Godhead, should be worshipped
If we would be partakers of the divine nature, we need to live by the divine life within which is the divine nature
Although we received the divine life at the time we believed, the divine nature must be continually enjoyed by us
Regeneration is unto the enjoyment of the riches of the divine life, and the riches of this life are the divine nature
We desire to be holy, godly, and spiritual because these things are according to God's nature, of which we partake
To do the things of God is natural to us because the divine things are according to the divine nature within us
While little babies do not have any knowledge of outward regulations, they still have the human nature that regulates what they eat
The emphasis on life is on the capacity to live, and the emphasis on nature is on the inclination of our living
We feel uneasy when we are proud, and we feel comfortable when we are humble because this is the nature and inclination of God
We feel uneasy when we take advantage of others and very happy when we share with others, because this is God's nature and inclination
The more we partake of the divine nature, the more we have holiness, love, righteousness, kindness, and all manner of divine attributes
We were made children of God and sons of God in order to be partakers of the divine nature so that we may be glorified with the divine glory
In brief, we should partake of the divine nature and enjoy what God is, the contents, the ingredients, of His being
We enjoy the divine nature by the full knowledge of the One who has called us by His glory and virtue and to His glory and virtue
We need to escape the corruption which is in the world by lust; that is, we need to abstain from lustful living
There is the need of God's word of promise to assure us, encourage us, strengthen us, and speed us on our way toward this goal
Knowing our need for assurance, encouragement, and strength, God has given us precious and exceedingly great promises
The Lord's promises encouraged Peter and the other disciples on their way toward the goal of God's glory and virtue
Leaping up and about, he stood and began to walk, and he entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God'
By means of the Lord's promises the early disciples were encouraged to press on to reach God's glory and attain the divine virtues
Every time we feel heavily burdened, we need to listen to the Lord's voice saying, 'My grace is sufficient for you
It is due to our weaknesses that the Lord's power has the ground to manifest itself, and we are able to enjoy His power
The Lord will do superabundantly above all that we ask or think for the church life according to the inner working power that operates in us
We may be careless concerning holiness because although we have received the divine nature, we may not enjoy it
When we read the great promise in 1 Thessalonians 5:23, we are helped, encouraged, and strengthened to live a holy life
Another great promise of God is found in 2 Corinthians 6:16 through 7:1, which says, 'What agreement does the temple of God have with idols?
On the basis of the great promise in this passage, he would certainly enjoy the holy divine nature that is in him
On the one hand, if we sow with blessings, we will reap with blessings, for God will bountifully supply seed to us
Consequently, we will be unable to enjoy the generous divine nature within us and to see God's blessing in His generosity
Based upon these promises, may we learn to be the partakers of the divine nature, those who enjoy the divine nature always, not occasionally
When we spend time reading this portion of the Word prayerfully we will be stirred up to give according to the generous divine nature of God
When we dwell on this passage, we will be encouraged and reminded to give generously according to the divine nature within us
Every portion of the New Testament is a promise that the Triune God will do everything for us to enjoy Himself as the divine nature
By pray-reading the promises, we partake of and enjoy the divine nature, and by partaking of the divine nature we develop in the divine life
In this message we will continue to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as our God and Savior
We will then go on to see the enjoyment and experience of Christ as the Master and as the element of our growth
To enter thus into the eternal kingdom of the Lord is related to entering into God's eternal glory, to which God has called us in Christ
In 2 Peter 1:3-11 we see that the development of the kingdom within us is actually our entrance into the kingdom
In verses 5 through 11 we have the development through growth in life unto the rich entrance into the eternal kingdom
The reason that the growth of Christ in us is our entrance into the kingdom is that this growing is the developing of the kingdom
If we would have the kingdom develop in us, we need to humble ourselves, empty ourselves, and unload ourselves
The losing of the soul today actually transforms the soul, but the saving of our soul today frustrates the transformation
With God's giving, we must be diligent to develop the seed of faith by taking the promises, by receiving His word
To unbelievers, the preaching concerning the Lord's coming sounded very much like a myth or a superstitious tale
Here Peter says that the apostles did not follow cleverly devised myths when they made known the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
He considered the transfiguration of the Lord a figure of His second coming, even as the Lord did in Luke 9:26-36
The Lord's coming back in glory also will be a fact, as real as the Lord's transfiguration, and he will be in it as well
In contrast to the false teachers, we need to escape 'the defilements of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ'
At the beginning of this Epistle, Peter speaks of grace, and now at the end he charges us to grow in this grace
Grace is God Himself as our life to be one with us, to save us, to make His home in us, and to be formed in us
To grow in grace is to grow in the enjoyment of all that Christ is to us as our spiritual food and living water
The realization of the knowledge of our Lord equals truth, the reality of all that He is, as in John 1:14 and 17
In this message we begin to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ in the Epistles of John
It is an endless life being the eternal divine uncreated life and the resurrection life which has passed through the test of death and Hades
John 1:2 goes on to say, 'We have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us'
The apostles saw eternal life, the life that was manifested, and then testified and reported this life to the believers
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He said, 'I am the bread of life,' 'I have come that they may have life,' and 'I am
Through the enjoyment of the eternal life which is the Word of life we can have fellowship with the apostles and with the Father and the Son
Such a fellowship was first the apostles' portion in their enjoyment of the Father and the Son through the Spirit
John goes on to say that he reported what he had seen and heard, not that we might have 'life' but that we might have 'fellowship'
In other words, what the apostles declare to the believers is the life, but what the believers have is the fellowship
As the electric lights in the ceiling of a room have a current flowing within them, so we all have the divine current flowing within us
Many times when we meet another child of God, although we may not say much outwardly, there is a mutual flow, a communication, between us
We have the reality that there is a real, divine, spiritual, heavenly, and living current always flowing within us
Horizontally we fellowship with one another, and vertically we fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ
The apostles then reported to the believers the eternal life in order that they might have fellowship with the apostles
Verse 6 says, 'If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth'
If you do not have the proper fellowship with the Lord, it is difficult to have fellowship with your fellow believers
In the same way, if you do not have the proper fellowship with your fellow believers, it is difficult to have fellowship with the Lord
In verse 3 only the Father and the Son are mentioned, not the Spirit, because the Spirit is implied in the fellowship
When we called on the name of the Lord, we may say that the Spirit came into us, that God came into us, or that the divine life came into us
When there is the proper contact, there will be a two-way traffic, and this traffic is fellowship, a common participation
Among the saints there is only one fellowship because there is only one life, one source of life, and one Lord of life-Christ Himself
The Lord Christ is the unique source of this unique life; hence, in this unique life we have the unique fellowship
The New Testament reveals that the Christian meeting, the Christian married life, and the Christian work are just the divine fellowship
To read a verse from the Bible to the saints in the Lord's table meeting may also be a small part of this fellowship
As we have seen, the fellowship of the divine life in the Body of Christ corresponds to the circulation of the blood in the physical body
When the blood flows in the blood vessels, there is circulation; when the blood is stationary, there is no circulation
Once the blood flow stops, death and detachment result, and the members are no longer related to each other or to the head
The fellowship of the Body is the circulation of the life of Christ in us, which is also the circulation of the Spirit of life in us
As soon as we resume our fellowship with the believers, we are refreshed, revived, supplied, happy, pleasant, and bright
In the church meetings, such as the prayer meeting and the bread-breaking meeting, there is a fellowship in the depth of our spirit
We may feel somewhat despondent before a meeting, but during the meeting we spontaneously sense a flow in our inner being
We may not listen to many messages, yet we are enlivened simply by praising and praying together with all the saints
Fellowship indicates a putting away of private interests and a joining with others for a certain common purpose
In this fellowship we enjoy God, the apostles, the believers, the universal church, and even the local churches
All this enjoyment depends on the fellowship of the divine life, and this fellowship issues out of the divine life itself
In this message we will continue to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Word of life
John 1:5-7a says, 'This is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all
Expressions such as God is light, God is love , and God is Spirit are used not in a metaphoric sense but in a predicative sense
Spirit denotes the nature of God's person; love, the nature of God's essence; and light, the nature of God's expression
When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines on us, it becomes truth
The entire Epistle discloses to us this one thing, that is, the enjoyment of the divine life through our abiding in its fellowship
Our life relationship with God cannot be broken, but our fellowship with Him will be broken if we do not abide in Him as the divine light
When we follow this light, we will by no means walk in darkness , which, according to the context, is the darkness of sin
As the divine truth is the expression of the divine light, so the satanic lie is the expression of the satanic darkness
John 1:6 says, 'If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth'
When we walk and live in the light of God, we have the joint enjoyment of the Triune God and the joint participation in His divine purpose
When we do not have the divine light but are rather in darkness, we have the sense that everything is vanity and emptiness
As we walk in the light, Christ, the Spirit, the church, the Body, and the members of the Body are all real to us
As believers, we all have some apprehension of the truth, but only a small number of believers may be in the light
Although under the shining we may have the truth, or the realization, we are not in the light until we are in God Himself
From the time that we were saved, we have been under the shining, coming to certain realizations and understandings
Probably a good number of us have occasionally had experiences in which we were brought into God and recognized that we were in the light
Some Christians who are fully in darkness would not even admit that they were wrong to be annoyed with a brother
We have some amount of truth, knowing that we should do this and be like that, but such a realization is not light; it is only truth
To apply the blood means that we have the realization that we are sinful but have not yet had our sins exposed in the light
The Lord's divinity indicated by the words His Son is a guarantee, a surety, that the efficacy of the blood of Jesus will remain forever
The cleansing in 1 John 1:7 is not the eternal cleansing before God; rather, it is the continuous cleansing in our conscience
Sins refers to the sinful deeds, the fruits of the indwelling sin, which are dealt with in the first section of Romans, 1:18-5:11
It refers also to one who offers legal aid or one who intercedes on behalf of someone else; hence, an advocate, counsel, or intercessor
It is used in the Gospel of John for the Spirit of reality as our Comforter within us, the One who takes care of our case or our affairs
When we sin, He, based on the propitiation that He accomplished, takes care of our case by interceding and pleading for us
In his Gospel John says, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever'
In the heavens we have the Lord Jesus Christ as our Comforter, and in our spirit we have the Spirit as another Comforter
For this reason, the Greek word parakletos is used for both the Comforter in the heavens and the Comforter in our spirit
Because the troubled disciples were in need of comfort, it is correct to render parakletos in John 14:26 as 'Comforter'
According to the usage in ancient times, this Greek word may refer to a person who functions as an attorney, a legal advocate
The situation in 1 John 2:1, in contrast to that in John 14:16, is a situation that requires an advocate or attorney
In his note he explains that the word patron is used in the sense of a Roman patron who maintained the interests of his clients in every way
When we are in a particular kind of situation, we may give the entire matter over into the hands of an attorney
It implies the thought of helping and nourishing, the thought of counseling, and also the thought of consoling
Perhaps he tells God that although God is holy and righteous, His children whom He loves are unrighteous and filthy
Our attorney, Christ, also may tell Satan to look upon His blood, which cleanses us from every sin, and to shut his accusing mouth
According to Revelation 12:10 and 11, Satan accuses God's children day and night, but they can overcome him by the blood of the Lamb
Once we realize that we are unclean unholy and unrighteous we may feel defeated and be cut off from the Lords dispensing of His life into us
We do have a member of our family, our elder Brother, the Son of the Father, who is our Advocate with the Father
On the one hand, the title Father is a sign of love; on the other hand, the title Advocate is a sign of righteousness
His righteous act on the cross fulfilled the righteous requirement of the righteous God for us and all sinners
Jesus Christ, the Righteous, is the righteous One, who is our Advocate, our Attorney with the Father, our heavenly Judge
Jesus Christ certainly is the One who is right, the right One, and only this right One can be our Advocate with the Father
Because we are the ones who are wrong, we need the righteous One to take care of our case, the One who is right with the Father and with us
In 17 we have the blood of Jesus in 21 the person of Christ as our Advocate and now in verse 2 we have Christ as a propitiation for our sins
Realizing the situation, the children should make confession to the Father, who is ready to forgive them and cleanse them
Day by day, we who have the divine life and the enjoyment of this life in fellowship need to be on the alert concerning sin
Through Christ as our Advocate and propitiation, we again have peace with the Father, and we enjoy fellowship with Him
According to its biblical meaning, propitiation leads to enjoyment, for it ushers in fellowship between God and us
According to Paul's word in Romans 3:25, God has set forth Christ as a propitiation cover through faith in His blood
Christ as the propitiation place is the place where God and His redeemed people may converse, have fellowship, and enjoy one another
Christ is the Advocate who pleads our case with the Father and who Himself is our propitiation, our Peacemaker
In His faithfulness and righteousness, the Father will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from unrighteousness
As we consider this matter, we will realize that this is not merely a doctrine but is something very experiential
From experience we know that when we confess our sins, we have the sense that the blood has cleansed us and that the Father has forgiven us
The Lord Jesus became the propitiation concerning our sins between God and us to create a peaceful situation for the life dispensing
The Lord Jesus is the Attorney in the heavenly court, handling our case upon the basis of His own propitiatory work
Based upon His propitiatory work, He is now our heavenly Attorney who represents our case in the heavenly court
We should notice that God 'is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
He righteously forgives us because of Christ's propitiation and faithfully forgives us because of His own spoken word
In 1 John 2:5-29; 3:5-8, 24; and 4:9-15, we see that we may enjoy Christ, who is a living person, as our abiding place
We have seen that in 1 John 4:9 John tells us that God sent His Son into the world that we might live through Him
In the love of God, the Son of God saves us not only from our sins by His blood but also from our death by His life
The word herein refers to the following fact not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins
Since our sins brought us under the requirements of God's righteousness and holiness, God could not receive us or abide with us peaceably
If we consider these verses together, we will see that God's sending His Son as a propitiation for our sins is not the goal
Rather, this is a procedure for arriving at the goal, and the goal is that we may have life and live through the Son
John 4:14-15 goes on to say, 'We have beheld and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world
The heretical Cerinthians did not confess this; hence, they did not have God abiding in them, nor did they abide in God
We may have expected John to say that whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God has the forgiveness of sins or has eternal life
John 2:12 says, 'I write to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you because of His name'
If we believe in the name of the Lord and call on His name, the first blessing that we receive is the forgiveness of sins
In 1 John 2:23 we are told that 'everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also'
Since the Son and the Father are one , to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father
Because the Father and the Son are one, we cannot separate the Son from the Father nor the Father from the Son
To deny the Son is to deny both the Son and the Father, and to confess the Son is to confess both the Son and the Father
Not to deny but to confess that the man Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God , is to let the Word of the eternal life abide in us
In so doing we abide in the Son and in the Father and are not led astray by the heretical teachings concerning Christ's person
In Christ we have an abiding place which is an eternal person, and in this abiding place we may enjoy the eternal life
It is that Jesus, being the Christ as the Son and the Father, is the eternal, divine life to us for our portion
According to verse 24, if we take the Son as the way to reach the Father, eventually we reach both the Son and the Father
It may sound logical to say that Christ as the Son is the only way for us to reach the Father as the destination
If we do not take the way, we will not arrive at the destination; if we take the way, we will reach the destination
John indicates that we will abide not only in the destination but also in the way, that is, both in the Son and in the Father
The Son is both the way and the destination, both the way to enter into the dwelling place and the dwelling place itself
In Titus 1:2 Paul speaks of 'the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the times of the ages'
It must have been that in eternity past the Father promised the Son that He would give His eternal life to His believers
The eternal life in verse 25 is the Word of life, and the Word of life is Jesus, Christ, the Father, and the Son
With Jesus we have the incarnation and crucifixion, with Christ we have the resurrection, and with the Son we have life
With these elements we have all the ingredients of the compound ointment divinity humanity incarnation crucifixion resurrection and life
As we abide in Christ, we enjoy the divine anointing, which is a wonderful person, the Spirit, moving and working in us
The Greek word for 'Christ' is Christos, which means the 'anointed One,' and the Greek word for 'anointing' is chrisma
In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul says, 'The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God'
Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God
Through that anointing, Christ has received the ointment, and eventually He, the anointed One, became the anointing One
God's intention is to work Himself into us as our life and our everything to make us His counterpart for the expression of Himself
The more we are anointed with the Triune God, the more the element of the Triune God is transfused into our being
We understand God's will and God's leading not by an explicit word in letters but through the inward anointing
The teaching of the anointing concerning these things keeps us that we may abide in Him , that is, in the Son and in the Father
It is also to abide in the fellowship of the divine life and to walk in the divine light , that is, to abide in the divine light
We should practice this abiding according to the teaching of the all-inclusive anointing so that our fellowship with God may be maintained
We are kept in this fellowship, this abiding, by the anointing, which is the moving of the Holy Spirit as the ointment within
More cleansing of the blood brings us into more anointing, and the more anointing we enjoy, the more we have life
To abide in Christ is to dwell in Him, to remain in fellowship with Him, that we may experience and enjoy His abiding in us
We abide in Christ so that He may abide in us by caring for the inward teaching of the all-inclusive anointing
If we abide in the Lord and have fellowship with Him, we spontaneously walk before the Lord and live in His will
If we live in a worldly way loving the world and not giving the Lord the first place how can we be brought into His presence when He comes
He is still a saved person, but he must suffer being put to shame, which will be a dealing and a discipline for him
That Lot's wife became a pillar of salt meant that she had lost her usefulness in the hand of God and had become a sign of shame
We do not sin habitually when we abide in Him, who was manifested to take away sins and undo, destroy, the works of the devil
In 1 John 3:6 John continues, 'Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him or known Him'
The expression abides in Him refers to remaining in the fellowship of the divine life and walking in the divine light
Not to have seen or known the Lord is not to have received any vision of Him or to have any realization of Him
In verse 7 John says, 'Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who practices righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous'
To be righteous is to be pure, without any stain of sin, lawlessness, and unrighteousness, even as Christ is pure
In verse 8 John goes on to say, 'He who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has sinned from the beginning
The devil has sinned from the beginning that is from the time when the devil began to rebel against God attempting to overthrow Gods rule
The Greek word translated 'for this' literally means 'unto this,' that is, 'to this end,' or 'for this purpose'
If we read the context of these verses, we will realize that it is an important matter to have a sign indicating that we are in the Lord
Because we know God subjectively, often we will not have any desire to vindicate ourselves or argue in our own defense
It is in this way that we know God experientially, and this knowing is a strong sign that we are in Him and one with Him
On the negative side, this requires that we deal with our sins; on the positive side, this requires that we keep His word
Such an abiding and its bases-the divine birth and the divine life as the divine seed-are mysterious yet real in the Spirit
We need to have the faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and we need to have the love to love all the brothers
As long as we believe in Christ and love all other Christians as our brothers, we are abiding in God and are complete
We abide in God because we are keeping His commandments, which charge us to believe in His Son and to love all the brothers of His Son
The Spirit, that is, the all-inclusive, compound life-giving Spirit, is the vital and crucial factor of abiding in the Lord
If we would enjoy a life of abiding in God, we must exercise our spirit, turn to our spirit, touch our spirit, and use our spirit
In 1 John 4:13, John says, 'In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit'
The Spirit, whom God has given to dwell in us , is the witness in our spirit , witnessing that we dwell in God and God in us
The abiding Spirit, that is, the indwelling Spirit, is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding, the mutual indwelling, of us and God
To abide in God is to dwell in Him, to remain in our fellowship with Him, that we may experience and enjoy His abiding in us
1 John 4:13 is definitely a fact: 'In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit'
The Spirit given by God who abides in us is the witness in our spirit, testifying that we abide in God and that God abides in us
In the universe there is at least One among all of God's creation, Jesus of Nazareth, who is a product of the two natures of God and man
Out of His Spirit is an expression that implies that the Spirit of God, whom God has given to us, is bountiful and without measure
By such a bountiful, immeasurable Spirit we know with full assurance that we and God are one and that we abide in each other
God has given us something of the Spirit, which indicates that all the riches of Christ are now the content of the Spirit
Eventually, what God has given us is the complete, consummated, all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, indwelling Spirit
Our God, the Father, has given us of this all-inclusive Spirit, who is the bountiful supply of Jesus Christ, the Son
Whoever believes that the man Jesus is the Christ, God incarnate , has been begotten of God and has become a child of God
Both in his Gospel and in this Epistle John stressed the divine birth through which the divine life is imparted into the believers in Christ
The divine birth with the divine life assures the Godbegotten believers giving them confidence in the ability and virtue of the divine life
Regenerated believers have the capability in the divine life to overcome the world, the powerful satanic world system
We all need to see that our spirit is mingled with the divine life and is the organ that can overcome the world
Even 1 John says that to this day we still have the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life
There is only one place in this universe that has been reserved by God and does not have Satan's footprints on it-our regenerated spirit
Within us we have not only a spirit, which has been born of God, but also the flesh, which was born of the fallen nature
If you are a student, when you read textbooks, study assignments, or attend classes, you should stay in your spirit
As long as we abide in our spirit, we overcome the world, we do not sin, and we can do what the Father would do and love what He would love
Faith is the substantiation of the unseen, divine, and spiritual things ; this substantiating power overcomes the world
Our faith brings us into an organic union, and it is this organic union, not the faith directly, that overcomes the world
In 1 John 5:5, John continues, 'And who is he who overcomes the world except him who believes that Jesus is the Son of God'?
The Gnostics and the Cerinthians, who were not believers of this kind, remained pitiful victims of the evil satanic system
Our believing that Jesus is the Son of God brings us into an organic union with the Son, who is the embodiment of the Triune God
For there are three who testify, the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are unto the one thing'
By these three God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us , that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing into His name
Christ came through water at His baptism, blood at His crucifixion, and the Spirit who is the reality at His resurrection
Whenever the New Testament uses the title the Son of God, its significance always involves the imparting of the divine life
Jesus was manifested as the Son of God in an open way by the water of baptism, by the blood He shed on the cross, and by the Spirit
Whether we consider ourselves good or bad, precious or worthless, God declares that we all are worthy of nothing but death and burial
The water of baptism testifies of God's judgment that we and the rest of the old creation need to be terminated
From the old creation, which needs to be terminated, a part has been predestinated by God unto the divine sonship
When Jesus died on the cross, His all-inclusive death terminated all the old creation, including the old man and the flesh
We have been terminated on the cross, but we were chosen to be holy and predestinated unto sonship before the foundation of the world
The Spirit, who is the truth, the reality , testifies that Jesus is the Son of God, in whom is the eternal life
The Lord Jesus has come to us in water, terminating us; in the blood, redeeming us; and in the Spirit, germinating us
In 1 John 5:11-12 we are told that 'this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son
The testimony of God is not only that Jesus is His Son but also that He gives to us eternal life, which is in His Son
We will live a life full of righteousness and love, a life that spontaneously overcomes the world, death, sin, the devil, and idols
By them we are assured and have the pledge that as long as we believe into the name of the Son of God, we have eternal life
We not only have the fact of eternal life; we also have the pledge, the guarantee, the title deed, to prove that we have eternal life
The basic fact of our divine birth prevents us, the regenerated ones, from practicing sin , that is, from living in sin
The Greek word poneros means one who is pernicious, harmfully evil, affecting and influencing others to be evil and vicious
The thought here is not that the evil one is not able to touch us; the thought is that the evil one does not touch us
John is saying that as long as we abide in our regenerated spirit, this spirit will keep us from sinning, and the evil one does not touch us
He knows that if he tries to touch us when we are abiding in our regenerated spirit, he will accomplish nothing
The thought here is not that the evil one cannot touch us, but that he does not touch us when we are in spirit
We know from experience that when we are in the flesh, forgetting our regenerated spirit, we become prey to the evil one
When we stay in our regenerated spirit, Satan knows that there is no way for him to touch us, and he will not try to touch us
As long as we stay in our regenerated spirit, we are in a refuge, a place of protection and safeguard, and the evil one does not touch us
The devil knows that his efforts will be in vain if he tries to touch one who has been begotten of God and who is keeping himself
Consider the day that the Lord Jesus went to the little house in Bethany, where He fellowshipped with His disciples
While the high priest was offering sacrifices and burning incense in the temple in Jerusalem God was not thereHe was in the house in Bethany
The high priest's service, the burning of the incense, and the worship in the temple were under the hand of the evil one
Although the Jews worshipped God, studied the Scriptures, and served God in their synagogues, God was not there
When the Lord spoke those words, He was in the believers' spirit, today's Bethany, where He fellowships with them
We must ask ourselves whether the Lord is in our prayer, our reading of the Bible, and our bread-breaking meeting
If we are not in the spirit, then the Lord is not in these things, and all these things are still under Satan's hand
As long as we remain in our regenerated spirit, we will be kept, and Satan will have no way in us and cannot harm or touch us
Besides this, everything else, including our flesh, our mind, our emotion, and our will, are all under Satan's hand
The church is God's Holy of Holies because the church is the aggregate of our regenerated spirits in which God dwells
The Triune God is both the true God and eternal life, and now we may enjoy Him as the true God and eternal life
In 1 John 5:20, John says that the Son of God has given us an understanding so that we may know Him who is true, the true One
The Lord Jesus, the Son of God, has come and has given us an understanding that we might know the genuine and real God
Now we have an enlightened mind and an enlivened spirit with the Spirit of reality, who reveals spiritual reality to us
The Greek word translated 'true' is alethinos, meaning 'genuine, real' , the opposite of false and counterfeit
The Son of God has given us an understanding so that we may know-that is, experience, enjoy, and possess-this divine reality
Not only do we know the true One and experience, enjoy, and possess Him as the reality, but we also are in this reality
When we are in the true One and His Son Jesus Christ, the true One is called the true God, and His Son Jesus Christ is called eternal life
Because we are in Them, God and Jesus Christ are no longer objective to us, and in our experience They are no longer two
In doctrine, there may be a distinction between God, Christ, and eternal life, but in our experience they are one
Unless we live in the true God and eternal life, we will have a substitute for the true God, and this substitute will be an idol
Verse 3 says, 'Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love'
Verse 7 continues, 'For many deceivers went out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh
To confess Jesus coming in the flesh is to confess that, as the Son of God, He was divinely conceived to be born in the flesh
John says in 2 John 7 that those who do not confess Jesus coming in the flesh are not only deceivers but also antichrists
The New Testament makes it emphatically clear that Christ's redemption was accomplished in His human body and by the shedding of His blood
According to the revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament, the Son came in the flesh with the Father and in the name of the Father
These persons went beyond the teaching concerning Christ, as today's modernists do, inventing something beyond the truth
The Cerinthian Gnostics, who boasted of their advanced thinking concerning the teaching of Christ, practiced this
Denying the truth concerning the deity of Christ, the modernists claim to be advanced in their philosophical thought
It is through the process of incarnation that God has been dispensed to us in the Son with the Father to be our enjoyment and reality
We are thus redeemed and regenerated to be one with God organically that we may partake of and enjoy Him in salvation and in life
Today's modernists, like the ancient Gnostics, do not have the Father and the Son, for they do not abide in the teaching of Christ
When used in a subjective sense faith denotes our action of believing when used in an objective sense faith denotes the object of our belief
Paul says, 'Holding faith and a good conscience, concerning which some, thrusting these away, have become shipwrecked regarding the faith'
The law was given in the Old Testament, but what God gives in the New Testament is the faith that includes all the items of God's new will
That is not the correct understanding of what Jude means by contending for the faith once for all delivered to the saints
We believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God incarnated as man, lived on earth and died on the cross for our sins to secure our redemption
Because we believe in Him, our sins have been forgiven, He has come into us as our life, and we have been regenerated
Although Paul in Ephesians 4 makes a clear distinction between the faith and doctrine, many Christians confuse these two things
Although all genuine Christians have the faith and salvation in common, we may not have all doctrines in common
Concerning the faith, we must be bold, strong, and definite, ready to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints
In verses 20 and 21 he charges the believers to build up themselves upon the holy faith and to live in the Triune God
In verse 20 Jude says, 'You, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit'
The truth of the faith in our apprehension and the Holy Spirit through our prayer are necessary for our building up
As we build up ourselves upon our most holy faith, we build ourselves up in a faith that is not only objective but also subjective
As long as we have this faith we have the processed God redemption regeneration the divine life and all things related to life and godliness
Faith in Jude 20 implies the true word, for faith is produced out of the contents of the true word, God's revelation
When we hear the words concerning this reality, the Holy Spirit works within us in a way that corresponds to these words
If we do not have faith, we have neither the materials with which to build nor the base, the foundation, on which to build
As believers, we build ourselves up with the content of our most holy faith, and we build up ourselves upon this faith as a foundation
To build up ourselves upon the faith does not mean to build ourselves up with theological doctrines or biblical knowledge
Jude is speaking to the believers corporately when he charges them to build up themselves in their most holy faith
If we would build up ourselves in the faith, we must do it in a corporate way; that is, we must do it in the Body, in the church life
According to Jude 20, if we would build up ourselves upon our most holy faith, we need to pray in the Holy Spirit
Because they have the Holy Spirit within them, they make all their decisions by exercising their spirit to pray in Him
If we want genuine, spiritual prayers, prayers that reach God, touch God, breathe in God, and are in God, we must pray in the Holy Spirit
In verse 21 Jude says, 'Keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life'
We should keep ourselves in the love of God by building up ourselves in the holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit
If we do not build up ourselves in the faith and pray in the Holy Spirit, it will be easy for us to depart from the love of God
Jude speaks of the love of God not in an objective way but in a subjective way, in the way of enjoying this love
While we are praying in the Spirit and keeping ourselves in the love of God, we should await further mercy from the Lord
Jude 20 and 21 charge the believers not only to build themselves up in the holy faith but also to live in the Triune God
We need to pray in the Holy Spirit, keep ourselves in the love of God, and await the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ
In 2 Corinthians 1314 Paul says The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all
We need to pray in the Holy Spirit that we may touch the source, the love of God, in which we await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
If we pray in the Spirit, keep ourselves in the Father's love, and wait for the Son's mercy, the eternal life in us will grow in measure
Unto eternal life means not only unto the enjoyment of eternal life but also unto the growth, the increase of the measure, of eternal life
In verses 22 and 23 Jude continues, 'On some have mercy, on those who are wavering; save them by snatching them out of the fire'
Jude's word concerning snatching the wavering ones out of the fire is a metaphor probably adopted from Zechariah 3:2
Jude 24 says, 'To Him who is able to guard you from stumbling and to set you before His glory without blemish in exultation'
God is able to guard us from stumbling and to set us before His glory without blemish in exultation through the Christ whom we enjoy
Glory here is the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus, which will be manifested at His appearing and in which He will come
The preposition in here means in the element of, and the word exultation signifies the exuberance of triumphant joy
Glory is the expression in splendor; majesty, the greatness in honor; might, the strength in power; and authority, the power in ruling
In this message we will see that we may express Christ by putting Him on and by triumphing in Him in our ministry
The phrase make no provision for the flesh corresponds to 812 where Paul says We are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh
We need to put on the Lord Jesus Christ as our second garment to live Him as our subjective righteousness and magnify Him
By wearing Him as our garment, we make no provision for the flesh; that is, we have no intention to provide anything for our lustful flesh
The flesh is hungry and desires food, but we must starve it to death, making no provision that will allow it to fulfill its lusts
Means to lead a man as a captive in a triumphal procession; the full phrase means to lead captive in a triumph over the enemies of Christ
Their move in their ministry for Christ was like a triumphal procession going from one place to another under God's leading
He and his co-workers were Christ's captives, bearing the fragrant incense of Christ, for His triumphant glory
The apostles' move as captives of Christ in their ministry for Him is God's celebration of Christ's victory over His enemies
He fought against Christ the heavenly General but eventually he was defeated subdued and captured and thereby became a captive of Christ
Saul of Tarsus was a strong, ambitious young man who fought against Christ, against God's economy, and against the churches
The ministers of the new covenant were captives in a triumphant procession for the celebration of Christ's victory
As Paul was marching in Christ's triumphal procession, he could praise the Lord for His victory and in this way testify of Him
The apostles' move in the ministry was like a triumphal celebration from one place to another under God's leading
Wherever that procession moved, they celebrated the victory of Christ and witnessed of Christ's triumph over them
We were defeated by Him, captured by Him, and subdued by Him, becoming submissive captives who say Amen to His victory and praise Him
We will always be conscious of the fact that we have been captured by Christ, subdued by Him, and gained by Him
He knows that now he is among those marching in the train of the victorious procession of the one who has captured him
Truthfully speaking, many of us must admit that instead of our being captives to Christ, Christ is a captive to us
Day by day there are many struggles, not between us and the world, or us and sins, but between us and the Lord
We have to be defeated, conquered, subdued, and eventually carried away as a captive in the triumphal procession of Christ's victory
Many seek for gifts of power, but what the church and the world need is not gifted persons but captured persons
The apostles are such incense-bearers in their ministry of Christ as well as captives in the train of His triumph
On the one hand, the apostles were captives; on the other hand, they were those bearing incense, the fragrance of Christ
They were not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself was the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God
If the fragrance of incense is imparted to him, wherever he goes, he will carry with him the fragrance of the incense
One aspect of our living Christ is our spiritual service, which is an outward action that issues from touching the inward feeling of Christ
We sense his eloquence, but we cannot sense the Lord's presence with him, and neither can we touch spiritual reality
In Philippians 3:8 Paul says that he counted everything as refuse for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
Whenever we speak Christ to others, we need to realize that our speaking is the spreading of the sweet fragrance of Christ
The apostles were a fragrance of Christ to God because they were saturated and permeated by Christ and with Christ
According to 2 Corinthians 12122 God firmly attaches us unto Christ has anointed us sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge
When we go out to visit people for the preaching of the gospel, they should be able to breathe in the fragrance of Christ
In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, 'For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing'
To some, to those who are God's chosen ones, this fragrance will be life; however, to others this fragrance will be death
Christ as the General won the victory over all His enemies and has had a triumphal procession to celebrate His great victory
In this procession we are the captives of Christ by His victory and ones who manifest the savor of the knowledge of Him
A letter of Christ does not mean a letter written by Christ; rather, this letter is a composition that uses Christ as the alphabet
All believers of Christ should be such living letters of Christ so that others may read and know Christ in their being
The extent to which Christ can be seen or read by others in us depends upon the extent to which Christ has been written into us
When a man is regenerated by the Holy Spirit and his spirit is made alive, he becomes a living epistle of Christ
Eventually, if you live and walk in the Spirit of life in your relationship with your parents, they will be convinced
The book of Revelation says clearly that Christ is the Alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet, and the Omega, the last letter
Anyone who lives Christ for the church knows Christ as alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and every other letter of the heavenly alphabet
We all should look to the Lord for His mercy and grace in order to carry on the work of writing Christ into the saints
Of merely teaching doctrines or the Bible to others, we must do the unique work of writing living letters of Christ
As apostles, Paul and his co-workers were themselves letters of Christ, epistles written with Christ as the content
Paul was a living letter written of Christ by the Holy Spirit with all the realities of Christ as the writing element
We see the all-inclusive, mysterious Christ, who is the mystery of God and who produces the mystery of Christ, the church
Paul, however, unveils to us the mystery of the all-inclusive Christ as the Head for the producing of the Body
When we read Paul's Epistles, we are reading him, yet what we see is not Paul himself but Christ as his constituent
Some of the saints may think that because they are not apostles, they cannot participate in writing a living letter of Christ
Of trying to convince him of the existence of God, the brother may testify of how he came to believe in God and receive Christ as his Savior
Teaching does not require any essence; however, inscribing does require an essence, just as writing with a pen requires ink
Peter did not do one kind of inscribing with one kind of essence, and Paul, a different kind of inscribing with a different kind of essence
In Acts 16:7 we read of the Spirit of Jesus; in Romans 8:9, of the Spirit of Christ; and in Philippians 1:19, of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
There should be something living within us all the time as evidence that Christ is being written into every part of our inner being
We also should aspire to be found in Christ, to be one with Christ, saturated with Christ, constituted of Christ, and reorganized with Him
Being anointed with the Spirit and filled with the life-giving Spirit, we will have the Spirit as the ink to write Christ into others
In order to be a letter of Christ inscribed with the Spirit of the living God, we must first be captured by Christ
If we are conquered, defeated, subdued, and captured by Christ, we will afford the Spirit a free way to write Christ into us
The Spirit of the living God is within us waiting for an opportunity to write something of Christ into our being, into our inward parts
We need to be defeated, conquered, and subdued, not doctrinally but practically in our mind, emotion, and will
To read and to study the Word is mainly to feed and nourish our inner man, not merely to acquire the knowledge of the letter
If a great deal of the Spirit has been inscribed into our being, we will not always need to function outwardly in church meetings
If in the meetings there are none who have Christ written into them, we will have the sense that the meeting is empty
Simply by being present he enriches the meeting, because a great deal of Christ has been written into him by the living Spirit
All these elements are compounded in the divine ink, and the divine ink as the divine element is applied to us by the servants of the Lord
We will not be the one actually doing the writing; the God who has been constituted into us will be the real Writer
The writer of these living letters is actually not Paul; the writer is the God who has been constituted into Paul's being
In 2 Corinthians 3:3 Paul says that the letter of Christ is inscribed 'not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh'
The indwelling Spirit, who is the transforming Spirit, is doing the work of writing in us, but we need to give Him our cooperation
Christ desires to be written into every part of our inner being, our heart, but we may be preoccupied by many other things
Although we may come to the church meetings, we need to ask ourselves how much of Christ has been written into us
Christ as the life-giving Spirit has come into our spirit to make us alive, to regenerate us, and to indwell us
Ezekiel 36:26, which tells us that God gives us a new heart and a new spirit, indicates that the heart and the spirit are two things
We need to be patient with one another in the church life because more and more of Christ is gradually being wrought into us
If, by the mercy and grace of the Lord, all the veils are removed, we will be mirrors beholding and reflecting Him with unveiled face
We may not realize, however, that we are still under certain veils and that these veils insulate us from the Lord's transfusion
Many Christians cannot behold and reflect the Lord because they are covered by a thick veil or perhaps several layers of veils
Paul's word about beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face was written with his background in Judaism in mind
Because Paul taught that the law was over and that circumcision was no longer necessary, many Jews were not willing to listen to him
Their doctrine regarding the law and circumcision was a veil that kept them from seeing the Christ preached by Paul
In addition to the religious concepts that veil people, every person is veiled by certain natural concepts or ideas
Differences of national character can make it difficult for believers from different countries to worship together
The various national characters, dispositions, habits, and customs are veils that keep us from beholding and reflecting the Lord
If you study the context of 2 Corinthians 3, you will see that the veil mentioned there is specifically the Old Testament in letters
It does not matter how holy, heavenly, spiritual, or religious a thing is; as long as it is not the Lord Himself, it can be a veil
With an unveiled face we will behold and reflect the glory of the Lord and be transformed into His image from glory to glory
That philosophy, the highest product of human culture, came into the early church, causing considerable frustration
Although philosophy may be the best product of human culture, since it is not the Lord, it becomes a veil and must be dealt with
Hebrews shows us that all the good things in Judaism should be considered as types, figures, and shadows of Christ
Before Jesus came, God used the Old Testament to present to His people many pictures of Christ from different angles
The book of Hebrews was written to tell the Jewish believers that they must drop the pictures the whole system of Judaism and look at Christ
The law philosophy Judaism with its scriptural items and teachings and spiritual gifts have become veils over the faces of many Christians
We are mirrors beholding Christ and reflecting Him, but the problem is that sometimes our heart is turned away from the Lord
We may feel that we have given up religion with all its traditions many years ago, but after that, to whom did we turn?
If our heart turns away from the Lord, He will be bound in our spirit and will have no way to come forth or spread out
Through the turning and opening of our heart to the Lord, we are able to behold the glory of the Lord face to face
The more we focus on Him and draw near to Him, the clearer and more glorious our reflection of His glory will be
Our heart is the crucial factor in our enjoyment of the Lord as the life-giving Spirit and in our being transformed into the Lord's image
The Lord through His Spirit will fill our being-our mind, emotion, and will-with His glory and with Himself as the Spirit
Consequently, whatever we think about, love, or choose will have the Lord's image because they will all have the Lord's element
The God whom we may look at is the processed and consummated Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, and we can look at Him in our spirit
We will have the sense that we are receiving something of God's element, that we are absorbing the riches of God into our being
To linger in the presence of the Lord while beholding and reflecting Him affords us a real taste, a real enjoyment
By the power of His life and with His life elements we will gradually be metabolically transformed to have His life shape
Corinthians 3:18 says that we 'are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit'
At the time of Genesis 126 Christ did not have the elements of incarnation humanity His allinclusive death and His wonderful resurrection
The 'same image' means that we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is
According to the usage in the New Testament, image refers not merely to an outward form but to the outward expression of the inner being
The expression of what we are is our image; our image is exactly according to who we are inwardly in our being
A believer who experiences the greatest amount of transformation is the one who is absolutely open to the Lord
Consequently, we have a change not only in our inward nature but also in our outward image so that we express the image of Christ
Our need is for Christ to increase within us all the time, that is, to spread from our spirit into the three parts of our soul
When we are transformed into His image, we will think, feel, and decide just as Christ thinks, feels, and decides
When our entire soul has been transformed into the image of Christ, we will have the image of Christ in our daily life
The way of transformation is by an increase and an advance, advancing from one degree of glory to another degree of glory
On the pathway of transformation we proceed from one level of glory to another level of glory, from glory to glory, progressively
We are not being transformed from behavior to behavior, from spirituality to spirituality, or from victory to victory
In verse 18 the word from indicates that the transformation is proceeding from the Spirit rather than being caused by Him
Transformation requires the addition of another element; without such an addition, transformation cannot take place
Through the transmission from the Lord Spirit, within whom is the element of the Lord, we are transformed from glory to glory
In 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 the Spirit is mentioned in three aspects: 'the Lord is the Spirit,' 'the Spirit of the Lord,' and 'the Lord Spirit'
As we are experiencing the divine life in our daily life, we will spontaneously have the sense that the Lord is the Spirit
If we open ourselves to Him He will have a way to purify us purge us saturate us permeate us fill us mingle Himself with us and transform us
He will saturate us, and we as a mirror will behold and reflect the glory of the Lord and be transformed into His image
Instead, we are under an environment of sufferings and pressures which works with the Spirit to kill our natural man
The life of Jesus refers to the resurrection life, which the Lord Jesus lived and expressed through the working of the cross
The continual daily grinding works for a specific purpose: that the life of Jesus might be manifested in our body
Philippians 3:10 says, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
Every day we are afflicted, perplexed, cast down, and persecuted, and our outward man is decaying, being consumed
If God desires this sister to grow in spirit, He must stretch out His hand to deal with her natural love for her daughter
Paul says that the putting to death of Jesus operates in us so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our body
The title Jesus in verses 10 and 11 implies that the apostles lived a life like the one the Lord Jesus lived on earth
The use of flesh and body interchangeably in 2 Corinthians 4:10-11 indicates that the mortal flesh is our fallen body
The death that operates in us and the putting to death of Jesus are the realization and application of the death of Christ in our daily life
Once he is under the discipline of the Holy Spirit, however, the Spirit will enable him to cooperate with and submit to the Holy Spirit
Without the death of the cross there is no work of the Holy Spirit wherever the Holy Spirit works there is a putting to death by the Spirit
When Paul speaks of the life of Jesus being manifested in us, that involves a process and requires a procedure
Paul, however, was always being delivered unto death so that the life of Jesus might be manifested in his mortal flesh
The Gospels are not primarily an account of the Lord's marvelous works; they are a description of the life the Lord Jesus lived on earth
The Gospels do describe the Lord's works, but much more the Gospels present the life Jesus lived and show us by what way He lived
There are a number of indications in the Gospels that the Lord Jesus did not care for the accomplishing of a great work
When Andrew and Philip told the Lord that the Greeks were seeking Him, He answered, 'The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified
As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy eternal life in resurrection
Instead of being exalted, they were always being put to death so that the life of Jesus could be manifested in their mortal flesh
In verse 7 the apostle Paul says We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us
We know that the expression earthen vessels refers not merely to our body but to us; we are made of clay and are earthen vessels
On the other hand, we need to be broken, consumed, and reduced so that Christ as the treasure can be manifested from within us
After we allow Christ to come into us, we as vessels need to be broken in order that Christ as the treasure might be expressed
God's shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything
The ministers of the new covenant were earthen vessels to contain the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure
Earthen vessels containing a treasure is a metaphor used to describe the ministers of the new covenant and their ministry
How much of this treasure we have in us is indicated by how much we express Christ in His all-inclusive death and resurrection
By the continued killing the working of death our outer man that is our material body with its animating soul is being consumed and worn out
The outer man being consumed means that our self is being consumed; that is, our mind, emotion, and will are being consumed
A brother may have great intellect, a strong mind, and clear thinking, but all of these can frustrate the pneumatic Christ in him
Such a dealing tears down his mind to the extent that when he encounters a certain matter, he does not dare to rely on his mind
At one time his legs could run very well; moreover, he had a mind that was able to think of many ways to fight and supplant
When God begins to deal with them, especially with their mind and intellect, they may lose their confidence in their thinking ability
When they encounter similar situations in the future, their spirit will spontaneously occupy the leading position
In the same principle, God strikes our emotion to the extent that it fails us, and we no longer have any confidence in it
At such a time, our spirit will spontaneously occupy the leading position and have preeminence over our emotion
We experience this not only while suffering persecution but also through our daily interaction with the fellow believers
Although there is much working of the cross in the church life and marriage life, simultaneously there is much manifestation of life
The more we are under the killing of the cross, the more life will be imparted through us into all those who deliver us to death
If we are willing to be under the daily killing, we will become life-imparters, even to those who deliver us to death
If we have been in the church life yet have remained whole, then no life has ever been manifested and imparted through us into others
In the apostle's suffering in his body, Christ was magnified, that is, shown or declared to be great , exalted, and extolled
Paul magnified Christ; he made Him great before the eyes of others, especially before the eyes of those who guarded him in prison
As Paul was held captive in a Roman prison, he magnified Christ, making Him appear great in the eyes of his captors
Although teachers may not be able to preach the gospel to their students, they can magnify Christ in the classroom
Such an expression was a declaration of the unlimited greatness of Christ and a declaration that Christ is inexhaustible
Even though Paul must have been mistreated in prison, he could be happy and display to the guards the unlimited greatness of Christ
The guards may have considered Paul to be strange or peculiar, viewing him as possessing something which they did not have
The experience of Christ in Philippians can be primarily related to four aspects: our circumstances, the unbelievers, the believers, and God
We magnify Christ in any kind of circumstance, condition, state, or situation, whether through life or through death
No matter what happens to us, we must remember that within us there is the all-inclusive Spirit supplying us all the time
If we need a wife, He will assign a proper, suitable wife, and if we need a certain kind of child, He will give us such a one
No matter what our state or circumstance may be, we can do all things in Him who empowers us so that He may be magnified in our body
In order to magnify Christ, we need to preach and impart Him to the unbelievers, presenting Him as the good tidings
In order to experience Christ and enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we need to do the work of preaching the gospel
The more we preach the gospel to present Christ to people, the more we will enjoy the bountiful Spirit within us
On the other hand, if we do not preach the gospel to present Christ to others, we will suffer the loss of the supply of the Spirit
The Spirit is the reality of the power of resurrection; He is the Spirit of Jesus Christ who includes both human suffering and resurrection
To worship and serve God by the Spirit is to worship and serve in the resurrection power not in anything natural in the flesh or by our self
It indicates that what is to follow is an explanation of the preceding verse, which speaks of Paul's magnification of Christ in his body
Although the matter of living Christ is of such tremendous importance, not many Christians have paid adequate attention to it
To live Christ means that no matter what our circumstances may be, Christ is magnified in us, and we are not put to shame in anything
Referring to the Word made flesh, John the Baptist declared, 'Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world'
If we magnify Christ by living Him we will become strong factors channels of supply to enable the saints to grow in life and enjoy the Lord
Possibly Paul's enjoyment of Christ in prison was a factor in bringing Onesimus, a runaway slave, to salvation
Paul also says to the believers in Philippi, 'I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of the faith'
Whether or not we are such factors of the progress and joy of others depends on whether or not we magnify Christ by living Him
Because Paul lived and magnified Christ to the uttermost, he could transfuse Christ into the saints and minister Christ to all the churches
In Philippians 1:19, Paul indicates that he lived Christ for His magnification by 'the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ'
The salvation here is not eternal salvation it is a subjective experiential and constant salvation in our daily life for magnifying Christ
It is the working out of the salvation in 2:12, and it means to be sustained and strengthened to live and magnify Christ
He then entered death, passed through death, conquered death, subdued death, overcame death, and came out of death
As such, He is not merely the Spirit of God but the Spirit of Jesus Christ with all the elements and factors of His processes
The Spirit to Paul was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God
The bountiful supply also includes an uplifted humanity, a humanity with a proper life, living, nature, and person
All that the Lord passed through in thirty-three and a half years of life on earth is now in the all-inclusive Spirit
Divinity and humanity, including the human living of the Lord Jesus, are in the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit
Now in the bountiful supply of the Spirit we have Christ's divinity, humanity, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
As we enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we partake of the ingredients of this supply without being aware of it
Whenever we try to behave ourselves apart from enjoying the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ we are political and hypocritical
As a result, Paul could realize that with this Triune God there is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
If we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we shall experience instant and constant salvation
When we find ourselves in a difficult environment, we simply need to apply the compound ointment, the compound Spirit
Of considering our difficult environment, we should turn to the spirit, apply the compound Spirit, and behold the Lord with an unveiled face
Both the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ will operate in us, and we will be anointed with the compound Spirit
What Paul speaks of in Philippians 1:20 is the magnification of Christ, but in 2:16 he speaks of holding forth the word of life
In Ephesians 6:17 and 18 Paul tells us to receive the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition
When we exercise our spirit in pray-reading the word, we apply the word to us and mingle the word and the Spirit
The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ in Philippians 1:19 is nothing less than the riches of Christ in Ephesians 3:8
With respect to Christ, there are the unsearchable riches, but with respect to the Spirit, there is the bountiful supply
If we would touch the unsearchable riches of Christ and partake of the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we must come to the Bible
Through the Word we realize that we receive Christ's divinity, humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, resurrection, and ascension
All these elements are included in the compound Spirit; they all are aspects of the bountiful supply of the Spirit
We simply need to come to the Bible, to the embodiment of the riches of Christ and of the bountiful supply of the Spirit
Christ's resurrection life will release the divine riches into us, strengthen our spirit, and edify our whole being
