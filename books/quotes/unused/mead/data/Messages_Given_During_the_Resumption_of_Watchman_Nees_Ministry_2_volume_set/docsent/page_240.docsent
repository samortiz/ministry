   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Wake at once the echo'ng chord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Praise the Lamb!" the chorus waking,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All in heav'n together throng;</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Loud and far each tongue partaking</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rolls around the endless song.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Grateful incense this, ascending</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ever to the Father's throne;</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every knee to Jesus bending,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the mind in heav'n is one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the Father's counsels claiming</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Equal honors to the Son,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the Son's effulgence beaming,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Makes the Father's glory known.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By the Spirit all pervading,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Crowned with light and joy unfading,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hail Him as the great "I AM."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Joyful now the new creation</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rests in undisturbed repose,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Blest in Jesus' full salvation,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sorrow now nor thraldom knows.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hark! the heavenly notes again!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Loudly swells the song of praise;</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through creation's vault, Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Amen! responsive joy doth raise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hymns, #127</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother Watchman Nee: This hymn was written by Brother J. N. Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Originally, it had thirteen stanzas.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here it is shrunk to seven stanzas.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The whole hymn is a praise, and it is also a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first stanza and the last stanza seem to stand apart from the rest of the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first stanza opens with the word "Hark!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is beckoning us to hear a voice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This hymn starts with a voice.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The second stanza tells us what one hears.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is the song of the heavenly chorus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The third line of this stanza says, "Loud and far each tongue partaking."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is making reference to the "every tongue" in Philippians 2:11.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The voice here is not just the voice of the redeemed, but the voice of the whole heaven plus the heavenly hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Stanza three mentions "every knee."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"Each tongue" in stanza two matches the "Lamb," while "every knee" in stanza three matches "the Father's throne."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the praises are directed first to the Son and then to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is why stanza four mentions the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In stanza five, the Spirit also comes in. With the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the creation can rest in repose.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Darby's hymns have one feature: all of them express a yearning for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Stanza six turns to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The first few stanzas give a high praise, and the whole creation is sustained in this praise.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If others were to write this hymn, they would have stopped at stanza five.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But Darby went on to speak about us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Stanza seven goes back to the praise in stanza one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In stanza one, the first "Hark!" holds us up in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In stanza seven, there is another "Hark!"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The word "again" in the first line of stanza seven is an echo of the first stanza.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In lines three and four, there are two "amens."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These two "amens" are placed in an excellent place.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The second "amen" echos the first "amen," in the same way that the last stanza echos the first stanza.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way, the hymn reads like a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every hymn has to be ascending in its sentiments.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There should be a line through which one can trace the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If it is not ascending, or if the line stops abruptly, it will not be a good hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the Psalms, there are the songs of degrees, which means the songs of ascent.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If a hymn is not well written, it will become a song of descent.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can only meet God by ascending all the time.</S>
