   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST AND THE CHRISTIAN CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE MEANING OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A Christian is a person who has received Christ and His great salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How does one receive Him and His accomplished work?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This question may appear difficult, yet the answer is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is only one way to receive Christ, and that is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In fact, to receive is just to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Someone counted the word "faith" in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It appears one hundred fifty times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thirty-five of these times, the word is used as a noun; the rest as a verb.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When used as a verb, it is translated "believe."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The reason this word is mentioned and emphasized repeatedly is because faith is the unique and crucial way of receiving Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The place that faith occupies in the Christian belief is paramount.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No other religion emphasizes faith in the way Christianity does.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sakya Muni never said, "Believe in me."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nor have you heard this from Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Neither can you find anything of this nature from the writings of Lao-tze, Chuan-tze, or any other sages.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But among the Christians, faith is constantly reiterated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible repeats itself one hundred fifty times that we have to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no other way but by believing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament does mention other things such as repentance, baptism, the kingdom of the heavens, behavior, etc. However, they appear much less frequently than faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible has to repeat and stress this point because it involves our receiving of Christ and His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When one believes, he receives.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, he is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE DEFINITION OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us first examine the meaning of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We will try to find a definition for this word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is remarkable that although the word "faith" has been used one hundred fifty times in the New Testament and more in the Old Testament, its definition is given only once.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only in one verse is the word explained.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to look carefully into this one place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us turn to Hebrews 11:1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here it gives us a unique explanation of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Faith is assurance of things hoped for, a conviction of things not seen" ASV, 1901 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>WHAT IS ASSURANCE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we read through this verse casually, we may think that we understand the definition of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when we think about this definition carefully, we will find that it does not lead us much of anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have to confess that I have personally spent a number of years on this word "assurance."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I pondered over it again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I could not arrive at any intelligent interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have spent much time to compare different English translations of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After examining at least a dozen different versions, I concluded that the word is best translated as substance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The verse would then read, "Faith is the substance of things hoped for."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, this rendering does not carry the full force of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>SUBSTANTIATING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I then spent quite some time studying the Greek language.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Finally, I was able to grasp the full impact of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet I could not find a suitable translation for it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To me the implication was clear.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But I could not think of a proper word to express it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Finally, I found the right word from J.N. Darby's translation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Mr. Darby was a renowned British authority in Bible exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He translated the word as "substantiating."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The word substance is easily understood.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all know that the substance of this table is wood, and the substance of this metal is iron.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But what is substantiating?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to spend some time to explain this word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I believe that substantiating is the ability which enables us to realize a substance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, when we see a table, we have the realization that its substance is wood.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Or consider the covering of the table.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After looking at it, we are able to tell that the substance of this cover is metal.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This very ability is the substantiating power.</S>
