   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Text I. MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible is not only a book about God; it is also about man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you took away God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the cross of Christ from the Bible, the Bible would be an empty book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Likewise, without man, there is no one for God to speak to in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, just as God and the Lord Jesus have a special place in the Bible, so does man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible, there is more written about man than about God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we want to know man, we must study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No other book describes man as thoroughly as the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, in order to know the Bible, we must know what it says concerning man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. The Creation of Man 1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man Being Created according to</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s Image and Likeness</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man not only possesses the highest created life, but he is also made in God s image and after God s likeness Gen 1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Besides man, no other creature resembles God in image and in likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man is the highest of God s created things, and he is created in God s image and after God s likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God s creation, man is the best container prepared by God for His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In His plan God ordained that man would possess His life in order to be the brothers of His Son; therefore, in His creation, He caused man to have His image and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Image refers to the inward parts, such as the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man s mind, emotion, and will, which constitute the intangible man, were created in God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, human functions of thought, opinion, and love resemble those of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The image of God also refers to the characteristics of His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The most prominent of God s attributes manifested in man are love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When God created man, He created him in His image, according to the attributes of His virtues, so that man can express Him through these virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, man has the desire to have love, light, holiness, and righteousness, and these virtues are sometimes expressed in his behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What man has, however, is only the image and not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man must receive God as his life and content and then God s love, light, holiness, and righteousness will fill up and enrich the human virtues of love, light, holiness, and righteousness to become the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likeness refers to the outward body which constitutes the tangible man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man s outward body was created after the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before God was incarnated to be a man, He appeared frequently to people in the Old Testament in the form of a man Gen 18:2, 16-17; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>13:9-10, 17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The form of man is the form of God, for man was created after the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>a. To Have Man to Express God</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The main purpose of God s creation of man, a corporate man, is to express God Gen 1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God did not create many men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God created mankind collectively in one person, Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, in Genesis 1:26 God said, Let them one man, but the pronoun is them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This proves that this man is a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God created such a corporate man in His own image and after His likeness so that man might express God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To Have Man to Exercise God s Dominion</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God created a corporate man to exercise His dominion Gen 1:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The word dominion includes more than just authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Dominion means having a kingdom as a sphere in which to exercise authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This corporate man is to use God s authority to deal with His enemy, to recover the earth by conquering it, and to bring in the kingdom of God to the earth Gen 1:26-28; 3:1; Rev 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God Placing Man in Front of the Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>in Order for Man to Receive Him as Life</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After God created man, He did not put the divine life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead, He gave man a free will; He wanted man to exercise the free will to choose, to take in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, He placed man in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to give man an opportunity to choose, God put the tree of knowledge of good and evil beside the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The tree of life denotes God as the source of life; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These two trees signify the two sources in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because God is great, He allowed man to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It was according to such a principle that, in the garden of Eden, God put Adam in front of two trees; He wanted man to choose Him, to take Him as life.</S>
