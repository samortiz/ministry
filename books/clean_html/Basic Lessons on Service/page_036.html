<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. In the Dispensing of the Triune God</H2><P>Our worship to the Father in the Lord's table meeting is in the dispensing of the Triune God. We have been baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). We also enjoy the Father's love, the Son's grace, and the Spirit's fellowship (2 Cor. 13:14). We must be in the dispensing of the Triune God. Then we can have the proper and true worship in the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</P><P>The focus of this message is as follows: the worship in the dispensing of the Triune God is the worship to the Father by His many sons with His firstborn Son as the offerings and in His Spirit who mingles Himself with our spirit as the unique place for our worship.</P><P>This fellowship should help us in the worship of the Father in the Lord's table meeting. This is the worship which the Lord revealed in John 4. John's Gospel tells us in chapter one that we have the right to be God's children. He gave as many as received Him the right, the authority, to be His children (v. 12). These children are born of God Himself. Then chapter three tells us how to be born of God. We must be born of water and the Spirit to be reborn of the Spirit (vv. 5-6). Chapter four goes on to reveal how to worship God as the Father in our spirit as the unique place of our worship and with the Son as the real offerings (vv. 23-24). We have to experience the dispensing of the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Then we can have the kind of worship the Father seeks.</P>
