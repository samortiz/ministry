   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Feeding, Hearing, and Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The healing of the deaf and dumb man follows the record concerning the Lord as the children s bread.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that after we enjoy the Lord s feeding, we need further healing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In particular, we need the healing of our deafness and dumbness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The healing is another step, a progressive step, in the carrying out of the Slave-Savior s gospel service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have pointed out that the Gospel of Mark is a progressive book.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Step by step we go from the Lord s feeding to His healing of our deafness and dumbness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to say, O Lord Jesus, thank You for Your feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You feed me in order to heal me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, Your feeding is for the healing of my deafness and dumbness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not enjoy the Lord s feeding, it will be very difficult for us to speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many of us can testify that before we enjoyed the Lord s feeding in the church life, it was difficult for us to pray publicly in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only did we not have the proper hearing, the hearing that becomes our speaking; we did not enjoy the Lord as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But since coming into the church life, we have been enjoying Him as our bread.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The feeding follows the exposure of our heart and is followed by the healing of our deafness and dumbness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the sequence in Mark 7, after the case of the Syrophoenician woman, we have the case of the healing of a deaf and dumb person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have emphasized the fact that speaking depends on hearing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not try to speak without listening.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we speak without listening, we shall speak in a nonsensical way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First we must have the proper hearing, and then we shall be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to listen with the intention of speaking, with the intention of repeating what we have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we all listen this way, many of us will be able to speak without difficulty in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because we are no longer deaf, we shall no longer have difficulty in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Experiencing the Healing of Our Ears and Tongue</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is rather easy to have our person healed in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To experience such a healing it may not be necessary for the Lord Jesus to touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, in chapter five the woman was healed simply by touching the hem of the Lord s garment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if we would receive the particular healing of our ears and tongue, we need the Lord to touch us in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to verse 33, the Lord took the deaf and dumb man away from the crowd privately, thrust His fingers into his ears, and then touched his tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that if we want our ears to be healed, we need the Lord to take us away to a private place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then, in private, He will thrust His fingers into our ears and touch our tongue with His spittle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The healing of the ears requires only the thrusting of the Lord s fingers into them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But for the healing of our tongue we need something that proceeds out of the Lord s mouth to be applied to our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This signifies that we need the anointing of our speaking organ with the word that proceeds out of the Lord s mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oh, how much we need the Lord to open our ears!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For too long our ears have been closed to the word of God, to God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We also need the essence of the Lord s word to be applied to our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot speak, we are dumb, because we lack the Lord s spittle, the essence of the word that proceeds out of His mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our tongue needs to be touched by this essence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to let the essence of the Lord s word become an ointment applied to our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we allow the Lord to anoint our tongue with the essence of His word, then our stammering tongue will be able to speak fluently.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>FEEDING THE FOUR THOUSAND</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After healing the deaf and dumb man, the Slave-Savior fed the four thousand 8:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Mark 8:2 says, I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with Me now three days, and they do not have anything to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Slave-Savior s virtues of compassion, sympathy, and tender care are vividly and sweetly displayed here in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The case of the feeding of the four thousand indicates that after we have been healed and are able to hear and speak, we are qualified to feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today many Christians are not qualified to feed others, because they themselves are still deaf and dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not listen carefully to God s speaking and if we do not have an anointed tongue, we shall not be able to feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only when we have been healed in a particular way, not merely in a general way, shall we be qualified to feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the case of the Syrophoenician woman the Lord Jesus was the only one doing the feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But in the case of the feeding of the four thousand all the disciples became the feeding ones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that after we experience the healing of our listening and speaking organs, we become those who can feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I expect that this will be the situation in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I believe that when the saints have been healed particularly in their listening and speaking organs, they will all become feeders.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They will be able to feed others by presenting the truth to them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For this feeding, we need a particular healing, the healing of our ears and our tongue.</S>
