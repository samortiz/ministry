   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Galatians 6:14 shows us that the cross stands between the world and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord is on one side, and the world is on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The cross stands in between.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We and the world stand on opposite sides of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The world crucified our Lord on the cross; therefore, the world is on the other side of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since I am on the Lord's side, I would have to go through the cross before I could reach the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no way to go around the cross because the cross is a fact; it is also history.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I cannot annul this fact, and I cannot annul history.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The world has crucified our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I cannot take another way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the cross is a fact, the crucifixion of the world to me is also an eternal fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I cannot annul the cross, I also cannot annul the fact that the world has been crucified to me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today there is no way for me to go to the world's side, unless I remove the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The cross is here, and I have no way to avoid it because the crucifixion of my Lord is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today, I am a person on the other side of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose a person's parents or brothers are killed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Others may offer a reasonable excuse for the murderer, but the person may say, "My folks are already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>An excuse cannot change this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If my folks were not yet dead, there would be something to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But now that they are dead, there is nothing more to say."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same principle, we can say that the cross is already here; what more is there to say?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The world has already crucified our Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, we are on the Lord's side, and we can only say, "World, from your point of view, I am crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From my point of view, you are also crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today, it is impossible for these two sides to communicate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is impossible for the world to come over.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is also impossible for us to go over.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The cross is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I have no way to annul the cross, I have no way to win the world over to my side.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My Lord has died, and there is no longer any possibility of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once we see the cross we can say, "I boast in the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As far as we are concerned, the world is crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As far as the world is concerned, we are crucified on the cross Gal 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The cross will be forever history and a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As Christians, we are on one side, while the world is on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The cross is in between.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As soon as we open our eyes, we will see nothing but the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we want to see the world, we have to see the cross first.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A new believer must be led by the Lord to see that his condition should match the Lord's condition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some people ask many questions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They ask, "Will we touch the world if we do this?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And they ask, "Can we do that?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot tell people what to do item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We only need to give them the general principle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The world is against the cross; it is against our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If our heart is open and soft before God and if we go to Him, the difference between the world and the cross spontaneously will become clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As soon as we go to the Lord, we will find out what the world is and what the world is not.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We only need to ask, "What is my relationship with this matter, and what was the Lord Jesus' relationship with it while He was on the earth?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As long as our relationship with the world is the same as the Lord's, we are all right.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If our position is different from the Lord's position, we have erred.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lamb was slain, and we are the followers of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are those who follow the Lamb wherever He may go Rev 14:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We take the same stand as that of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Anything that is not on the same ground as the Lord or that stands against the Lord is the world, and we must depart from it.</S>
