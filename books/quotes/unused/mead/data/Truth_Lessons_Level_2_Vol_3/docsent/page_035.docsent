   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Feast</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ as our portion for our enjoyment is also our feast.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Colossians 2:16-17 says, "Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The various items of the ceremonial law mentioned here are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come, but the body is of Christ and is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The body, like a man's physical body, is the substance, something solid.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The rituals in the law are a shadow of the real things in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is the reality of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the good things in the gospel belong to Christ and are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul's word here indicates that to the believers Christ is the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is typified by the yearly feasts of the Jews, such as the Passover, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Three times a year the Jews went up to Jerusalem to keep the feasts, to eat, drink, and rejoice together with God before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the feasts signify joy, enjoyment, and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although the feasts were enjoyable, they were simply shadows of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is our real joy, enjoyment, and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is the reality of all the feasts.</S>
