<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PURPOSE OF THE ELDERS'<br>CONTACT WITH PEOPLE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 14:3-5, 31; Gal. 6:1; Eph. 3:8; Col. 1:28; John 4:15</H1><P>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning the purpose of the elders' contact with people. The elders must contact people. If the elders do not properly contact people, there is no proper eldership. Many times we consider that the eldership is simply the management of the church, the caring for the things related to the church administration. We feel that as long as the business affairs of the church are adequately cared for, the eldership is proper. However, this is not the case. The church is not a business organization; it is the Body of Christ in life. A church may be organized in a good way, but it still may have a shortage of life. A building complex may be very well arranged and be neat, clean, and beautiful, but there is no life in it. On the other hand, an orchard may seem to be disorderly, but it is full of life, full of fruit. When the Lord comes to look at the church, He looks for life. He looks to see how many persons are under the care of the eldership, how they are doing, and how their growth, life, and daily living are. Therefore, we need a change in our concept regarding the eldership.</P><P>The elders must pick up the burden to contact people. It is not very meaningful for the elders to care for the business affairs of the church. Rather, the elders should make a thorough and clear arrangement in which the business affairs, such as keeping the accounting books, are delegated to the serving ones, the deacons and deaconesses. The elders should not count money; they should count the people under their care. They should know how many people are under their care and what each one's condition is. Of course, the spending of money in the church should be under the direction and management of the elders, but the business affairs should be directly carried out by the deacons while the elders go out to contact people.</P><P>The elders should contact two or three persons a day. Whether or not this is difficult for us depends on our habit. We may not have practiced and exercised to contact people until it has become our habit. Moreover, we may not have been born as persons who like to contact people. However, in the ministry we are compelled, forced, to forget about ourselves and to contact people. The elders need to be adjusted in the matter of contacting people in a successful way. They must answer to the Lord regarding how many persons have been brought to the Lord through them since they became elders and whether their way to contact people is more effective today than it was five years ago. An elder should be concerned about whether or not he has contacted people in an adequate way. It is a failure for an elder not to contact people for several days. All the people in the church need the care of the elders, and the elders can only render care by contacting them.</P>
