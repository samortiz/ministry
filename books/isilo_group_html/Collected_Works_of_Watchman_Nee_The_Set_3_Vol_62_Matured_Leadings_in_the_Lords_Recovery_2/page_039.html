In doing something, we may come across some knowledge of the brothers and sisters. Other than trying to understand what we need to know, we must avoid trying to know too much about the brothers and sisters. Even if you do know something, you should not tell others about it lightly. Man has a lust to know and to probe into other people's business. For example, we may see two brothers talking to each other, and within us there is an urge to eavesdrop. This lust must be dealt with strictly. We have to remember that the Lord Jesus' Spirit knows everything that goes on in man's heart (Mark 2:8). Yet the book of Isaiah tells us that he is a blind and deaf servant (42:19). Our Lord seemed to be ignorant about many things. For example, Judas was a thief, yet the Lord asked him to take charge of the purse. We have to learn from our Lord's example. We should only pick up knowledge of other people's business under the Lord's sovereignty. If a man has a craving to know others' business, he is a very fallen man indeed.</p><p>Moreover, the responsible ones should not lightly talk about the spiritual strengths or weaknesses of others. We have to learn to speak under the leading of the Holy Spirit. Our speaking has to be discreet, and we have to be in fear and trembling when we speak. Unless God measures the knowledge of the saints' problems to us, we should not probe into them. We should not scheme to know the brothers' and sisters' problems. Even if they reveal their secrets to us, we should keep this information secret. We must all learn to speak under the restriction of the Holy Spirit. These rules should be adhered to closely.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ADVANTAGES OF FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>Watchman Nee:The most intimate kind of fellowship is the fellowship in the homes. Hence, there is much profit to the saints opening up their homes for fellowship. The responsible ones in a district should set a good example for the other brothers and sisters to follow. When Timothy and Silas reached Paul, he was constrained by the word (Acts 18:5). Later, Paul went to Troas for the gospel. When he did not find Titus, he had no rest in his spirit, and taking leave of them he went forth into Macedonia (2 Cor. 2:12-13). Paul had intimate fellowship with Titus. When Paul did not see him, he had no rest in his spirit. Christians do not necessarily have to communicate their problems with each other through words. Many times because of intimate fellowship, they are able to touch each others' condition in their spirits. Some brothers and sisters are reluctant to obey the Lord and forsake the world. But through fellowship their problems are solved. It is not our ability that solves the problems but the flow of God's life through fellowship that spontaneously washes others' feet, renews and invigorates them, and solves their problems.</p><h2 class="head1">DIVINE LOVE AND DIVINE FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>The meals among the brothers and sisters cannot be an ordinary meal together. They must be a kind of agape as described in Jude 12. That word can be translated as "love feast." In the original language, there is only the word love, not feast. It is in the eating that the love is expressed. In the early churches, the believers often took meals together for the sake of fellowshipping and worshipping together in love (Acts 2:46). Such feasts were often linked to the Lord's supper (1 Cor. 11:20-21, 33); they were called the agape. Hence, when we come together to eat, we express our mutual love one for the other. We break bread together for mutual fellowship; this is our communion. This is the meaning of our breaking of bread. The Lord never charged individuals to break bread by themselves. He gave this commandment where at least three or five people are gathered together (cf. Luke 22:19-20). The breaking of bread is for remembering the Lord on the one hand and for fellowship among the believers on the other hand.</p><h2 class="head1">SUPPLYING OTHERS WITH LIFE</h2><p>It is not too hard for the leading brothers to lead the saints with the truth. Since the feeling within each person's spirit varies, you have to learn to touch the feeling within man's spirit. The brothers and sisters may be depressed or elated in their spiritual feelings. The degree of depression and elation may be different. In fellowshipping with them, you have to have some spiritual discernment. With discernment you will render them some practical spiritual supply in life. Man's real need is the supply of life, not zealous words. A man cannot be zealous all the time. The responsible ones have to be sensitive in their spirit. They have to feel what the brothers and sisters feel.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
