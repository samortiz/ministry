   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FAITHFULNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Romans 3:7 Paul speaks concerning a different aspect of the truth: But if the truth of God abounded in my lie unto His glory, why still am I also judged as a sinner?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse truth refers to the faithfulness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This, of course, is different from the meaning of truth in 1:18, where truth denotes the characteristic of God as revealed through the visible things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in Romans 3:7 we have another matter concerning God God s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can we prove that the truth in Romans 3:7 denotes God s faithfulness?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This can be proved by studying the context.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verses 3 and 4 say, For what if some disbelieved?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Shall their unbelief make the faithfulness of God of none effect?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But let God be true and every man a liar, as it is written, That You should be justified in Your sayings and will overcome when You are judged.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Notice that in verse 3 the word faithfulness is used.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then in verse 4 we have the adjective true.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 4 indicates that God is true, faithful, in what He says; that is, God is faithful in His words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verses 5 and 6 Paul continues, But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I speak according to man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise how shall God judge the world?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These verses also are related to God s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then in verse 7 Paul goes on to speak concerning the truth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the context, therefore, truth here denotes God s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of saying the truth of God, Paul could have said, the faithfulness of God, since truth here equals faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the reason we interpret the word truth in Romans 3:7 as denoting God s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Romans 15:8 says, For I say that Christ has become a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises given to the fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this verse truth also denotes God s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not understand the word truth in this verse as referring to God s faithfulness, we shall not be able to understand this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ became a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that Christ became a servant of the circumcision for the faithfulness of God, to confirm the promises.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here Paul indicates that whatever God has promised, He will fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God fulfills His promises because He is faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once again, we see that truth in Romans 3:7 and 15:8 refers to a particular virtue of God, God s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE HUMAN VIRTUE OF HONESTY</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Mark 12:14 says, And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man; for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Pharisees were trying to trap the Lord Jesus by asking Him this question.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before they asked the question, they said to Him that He was true and taught the way of God in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here in truth means in honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the Lord was true and honest, He taught the Word of God in honesty, not in falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, in this verse truth denotes the human virtue of honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 2 Corinthians 11:10 the word truth is again used to denote a human virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this verse Paul says, The truth of Christ is in me, that this boasting shall not be stopped concerning me in the regions of Achaia.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here truth denotes truthfulness, faithfulness, trustworthiness, honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, it denotes the faithfulness, the honesty, of the Lord Jesus when He lived on earth as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then it denotes this virtue as present in the living of the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This virtue was an attribute of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But since Paul lived by Christ, whatever Christ is became his virtue in his behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The important point for us to see is that in 2 Corinthians 11:10 truth denotes the human virtue of truthfulness, trustworthiness, faithfulness, and honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First John 3:18 tells us to love in truth: Little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in deed and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here truth denotes sincerity in contrast to tongue, just as deed is in contrast to word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this verse the apostle John is telling us to love in truth, in honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we say that we love our brother, we should love him in deed and in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, we shall love only in word or in tongue, but not in sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>LOVING IN TRUTH AND KNOWING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 2 John 1 the apostle John uses the word truth in two ways: The elder to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First, John speaks of loving in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this case truth denotes the revealed divine reality the Triune God dispensed into man in the Son Jesus Christ becoming man s genuineness and sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, truth in this sense denotes a human virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, this virtue is not produced by our natural being; rather, it issues from the enjoyment of the divine reality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the divine reality becoming our genuineness and our sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this verse John also speaks of knowing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here truth denotes the divine reality of the gospel, especially concerning the Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I use these verses as examples to point out our need to study all the verses in the New Testament that speak of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then with the help of the note on the word truth in 1 John 1:6, we can discern how this word is used in different verses.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As 2 John 1 indicates, this word may be used in two different ways in the same verse.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In each case, the denotation of the word is determined by the context.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, to understand the meaning of the word truth in any particular verse, we need to study its context.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As we have pointed out, the Greek word for truth, aletheia, is used in the New Testament more than one hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By studying this word in its context, we shall be helped to have a proper understanding of truth in the New Testament.</S>
