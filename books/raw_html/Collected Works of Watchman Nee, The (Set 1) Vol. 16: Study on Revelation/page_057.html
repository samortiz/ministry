<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BABYLON AND ITS DESTRUCTION<br>(Revelation 17:1—20:6)</H1><P>Revelation 17:1—19:4 should be considered as one chapter rather than three separate chapters. Revelation 18:1-3 is the continuation and development of earlier verses since 18:3 speaks of three matters: (1) "All the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication," which is mentioned only in chapter seventeen (17:2); (2) "And the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her luxury," which is mentioned only in chapter eighteen (18:11-15); and (3) "And the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her," which is mentioned in both chapters seventeen and eighteen (17:2; 18:9).</P><P>Revelation 16:19 speaks of the great city, Babylon, while 14:8 speaks of Babylon the Great. If these were the only references to Babylon, without chapters seventeen and eighteen, there would be no way to know clearly what they mean. In chapters seventeen and eighteen, there are two Babylons: one is Babylon the Great, and the other is the great city, Babylon.</P><P>The word Babylon is from the word Babel. According to Genesis 10—11, Babel was a city in Shinar built by Nimrod, a man who relied on his own strength to protect himself. Genesis 11:1-4 records the beginning of the tower of Babel. Because God confounded their language and scattered the people abroad, the name of the city was called Babel (v. 9). Babel, or Babylon, means confusion.</P><P>Babel was also a place of idol worship which is contrary to God. This city became greater and greater and reached its climax during the time of Nebuchadnezzar. At that time, because the Israelites rebelled against God, God delivered them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. This was at the time of Daniel. One day Nebuchadnezzar had a dream, and through Daniel's interpretation, he was helped to understand the dream. In this dream the golden head of the great image signifies Babylon at its height. Later, Media and Persia (the silver arms) destroyed Babylon, and the city became desolate. Following this, Greece (the bronze abdomen) destroyed the empires of Media and Persia. Then the Roman Empire (the iron legs) destroyed the empire of Greece. Babylon was the first kingdom, and the Roman Empire, the last. All four of these kingdoms persecuted the Jews. All of the first three nations have passed, but the influence of the Roman Empire remains to this day, although the ten toes have not yet appeared. Today the Jews are still under the rule of the Roman Empire (because England is still part of the Roman Empire). Babylon worshipped idols intensely and hated the Jews to the uttermost. The Roman Empire was the same.</P><P>Rome was not only a political city but also a center of religion. At the beginning of the church age, Rome had the greatest number of Christians, yet Rome hated the Christians the most. In the fourth century, Constantine embraced Christianity, encouraging and rewarding his people to join it. At that time he accepted Christianity as the state religion. It was also at that time that the center of politics shifted from Rome to Constantinople. Rome remained under the reign of Constantinople until A.D. 700. Eventually, at a conference held by Leo III in Constantinople (A.D. 725), it was decided that worshipping idols was heretical and, therefore, illegal. Rome opposed this decision and separated herself from Constantinople. Since that time, the church was divided into the eastern Roman religion (the Greek Orthodox Church) and the western Roman religion (today's Roman Catholic Church). The Eastern Church gradually became weaker, while the Roman Catholic Church grew more prosperous. Later, because the Roman Catholic Church was in power, many faithful Christians who loved the Lord were killed.</P><P>Revelation 17 and 18 indicate that the Roman Church will prosper beyond anything that has ever been recorded, and her power will be exceedingly great. When Antichrist comes, he will set up his own image for the people to worship. Therefore, Antichrist and the ten kings with him will dispose of the Roman Church. However, even after the religious Rome is terminated, the political Roman Empire will still exist, having the Mediterranean Sea as its center. After the three and a half years of the great tribulation, God will destroy the political Rome.</P><P>Why is it that chapters seventeen and eighteen do not refer to Rome directly, but rather mention Babylon? It is because John was living under the reign of the Roman Empire. If he had referred to Rome directly, this book could not have been published. This does not mean that John was afraid to write in an open way, but that the Holy Spirit intended to keep it hidden. However, the Holy Spirit, so that people might not mistakenly consider Babylon as the historical Babylon, says in Revelation 17:5, "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT." First, the word "mystery" indicates that this must be interpreted spiritually rather than literally. For example, if in Revelation 11:8, Jerusalem had been clearly spelled out, this book would have been opposed by the Jews. Therefore, it was written with spiritual implications. Second, John did not say Babylon but "Babylon the Great," indicating that this Babylon must be much greater than the physical, historical Babylon. When we read these chapters in this way, we realize that Babylon here is not the ancient Babylon, but Rome.</P>
