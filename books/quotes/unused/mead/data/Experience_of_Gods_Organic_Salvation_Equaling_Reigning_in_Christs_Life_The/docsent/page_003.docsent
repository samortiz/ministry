   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. GOD REGENERATES US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT WE MAY HAVE HIS DIVINE LIFE A. As the Base for Us to Grow in the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In God s organic salvation, God first regenerates us that we may have His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have said that regeneration is the center of God s entire salvation and the commencement of God s salvation in its organic aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today we see further that regeneration is the base of God s organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This base is of two aspects: first, it is the base for us to grow in the divine life; second, it is the base for us to be built up in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Regeneration is the base both for our growth and for our building up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit of God Regenerates Us</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>in Our Spirit with the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In regeneration the Spirit of God regenerates us in our spirit with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Regeneration is not an outward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not to mend one s ways and turn over a new leaf as people generally say; nor is it, as the Chinese say, that everything in the past died yesterday and everything henceforth is born today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is the common Chinese saying, not the biblical revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reality of regeneration is related to the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One is the divine Spirit of God, the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ; the other is our created human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the day we received the Lord with repentance by believing into His name, He as the divine Spirit came into our spirit to enliven it; thus, we were regenerated in our created spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the real meaning of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That which is born of the Spirit is spirit John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit begetting the spirit is the reality of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our spirit has been regenerated and made alive; hence, we are a group of regenerated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>a. That We May Be Born of God as God s Species</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Regeneration is our being born of God as God s species John 1:13 , that is, that we may be of the same kind as God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a concept is exceedingly great, high, and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the beginning, we human beings were created according to the image of God and were of God s kind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet we did not have God s life or His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when our spirit was made alive by His Spirit through regeneration, we were born to be children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 1:12 says, But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s children are God s species.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Goats beget goats, cows beget cows, and humans beget humans; likewise, God begets gods.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We who have been born of God are God s species.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not share in the divine Godhead, but we have God s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The heart s desire and good pleasure of God are to have a group of people who are exactly like Him, having His nature and His life to be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why we need regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to be regenerated not because we have sins but because God s desire is that we have His life and be exactly like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That, in Addition to Our Natural Life,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We May Have the Divine, Eternal Life of God</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, regeneration means that, in addition to our natural life, we have the divine, eternal life of God John 3:16, 36a as the basis and means of our spiritual life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regeneration is not that we may improve our behavior, that we may have religious zeal and live a devout life, or that we may pay attention to ethics and morality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, regeneration is for us to have God s eternal life in addition to our natural life; this is to have the uncreated life, which is God Himself, in addition to our original, created life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This divine, eternal life becomes the basis and means of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What God desires today is for all of our living to be based on this life and by this life.</S>
