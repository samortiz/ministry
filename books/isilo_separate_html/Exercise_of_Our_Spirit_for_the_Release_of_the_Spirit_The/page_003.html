<p>Our problem today is not with teaching or knowledge but with the exercise of our spirit. How often during the day do we exercise our spirit to release the Holy Spirit? I am afraid that a number of us may not even know how to exercise our spirit. We know how to exercise our arms and legs, but we do not know how to exercise and use our spirit. The best way to exercise our legs and feet is to walk or run, and the best way to exercise our spirit is to pray. However, when we pray, we often exercise our mind instead of exercising our spirit. Thus, in order to exercise our spirit, we must forget all our thoughts and outward circumstances and take care of our inner sense.</p>
<p>Sometimes while we pray, we simultaneously consider and think about various matters in our mind. Outwardly we may be praying, but inwardly we are absolutely in our mind and not in our spirit. This is not real prayer; rather, it is somewhat artificial. An artificial prayer is one in which we do not care for the inner sense and simply pray according to the considerations and thoughts in our mind. Real prayer is when we do not care about our circumstances or about who is around us and simply utter what is in our spirit, praying from our innermost part. Many times when others are praying, we have the sense that their prayers are from the mind and not the spirit. We do not sense the anointing within; there is no echo within us. However, sometimes we hear someone pray, and there is an anointing or response within us. That kind of prayer touches our innermost being because it is from the spirit, not the mind.</p>
<p>We must learn to pray real prayers, prayers that are uttered from our innermost part. Some may say that they do not have any feeling in their innermost part or that they do not sense the moving or inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This may be true, but this does not mean that we should wait for the inspiration of the Spirit. When we want to start a car, we do not wait for the car to start itself. We simply start the car ourselves. In the same sense, we should not wait for the Spirit to inspire us. The Spirit, like the car, is waiting for us. It is our responsibility to exercise our spirit to release the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>If we exercise and release our spirit, the Spirit in our spirit will be released. However, in order to release our spirit, we must open ourselves. Many times we are closed because of our emotions. Perhaps we may have trouble with our spouse, or we may receive some bad news during the day that makes us unhappy. Thus, when we come to the meeting, we come depressed and suppressed. We come to the meeting with our spirit bound by our emotions and become a burden to the meeting. If all the brothers came to the meeting with such a spirit, the atmosphere of the meeting would be very heavy, and no one would want to stay in the meeting. Thus, we must learn to allow our emotions to be broken, to forget about our emotions. We must learn to go along not with our emotions but to go along with our spirit. If we allow our emotions to be broken and learn to release our spirit, the Spirit in our spirit will automatically be released.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we must condemn our emotions. Actually, the more spiritual a person is, the more emotional he will be. The Spirit cannot fill someone who is emotionless. Thus, you should not be afraid of being emotional. However, it is wrong to be emotional simply in yourself. To be emotional in the spirit is right. This word may seem quite contradictory; on the one hand, we must learn to deny our emotions, and on the other hand, we must learn how to be emotional. However, I believe we can understand this word.</p>
<p>Some people are bound not by their emotions but by their mind. When they come to the meetings, they come with many thoughts and considerations, and these thoughts and considerations put their spirit in bondage. Thus, they must be broken so that they would know how to exercise the spirit and that the Spirit within them would be released. Then there would be a current, a flow, that would refresh, strengthen, and renew others and that would bring life into the meeting. If a few saints came to the meeting with a released spirit, denying their mind, emotion, and will and exercising their spirit, the rest of the saints would be encouraged to also release their spirit.</p>
<p>Our meetings need to be living and full of the moving, burning, and flowing of the Holy Spirit. This kind of meeting will meet many people&rsquo;s needs. Some of us may despise the brothers and sisters who do not come to the meetings. Of course, it is not proper for these saints to neglect the meetings, but we should not despise them. Rather, we must ask why they are not coming to the meetings and also consider what the condition of our meetings is. If our meetings are not living, burning, refreshing, satisfying, and supplying, the saints who are cold or backslidden will not come because they cannot be helped in such meetings. However, if the meetings are burning, living, and refreshing, people will be attracted, and the people who come will receive the help that they need.</p>
<p>The vitality of the meetings depends on the exercise of the spirit. To have a living meeting we all must learn how to exercise our spirit. When we come to the meeting, we should be like the members of a basketball team; we should come not to sit around but to exercise and to pass the ball. However, many times when we come to the meetings, we merely sit, listen, watch, and criticize inwardly. This kind of attitude brings in death. Instead, our attitude should be, &ldquo;I came to the meeting to exercise my spirit. I do not care whether or not others come. I came here to practice playing ball.&rdquo; We should all exercise our spirit, and we should follow and cooperate with one another, just like the players on a team. This will release the Spirit, release others, and become a great help to everyone.</p>
<p>Our thought is that in the meetings we must advise people, admonish them, and warn them. However, none of this works unless the Holy Spirit is moving. A little moving of the Spirit in the meetings will subdue people, convince them, bring them through their situations, and settle and solve their problems. In a sense, we do not need teachings and knowledge. Today we Christians have much knowledge but not much reality. For instance, we know that we must love others, yet we do not truly love others. This is because we are not in the current of the Spirit and do not give the Spirit a chance to move in us. What we need is the current, the moving, and the flowing of the Spirit through us and from within us. Teachings are useful but only when they are given in the flow and current of the Holy Spirit. Without the flow of the Holy Spirit, teachings are dead and useless.</p>
<p>There is no need to be formal in the meetings. Formality in the meetings brings in death and kills the meetings. When our meetings are too formal, those who come to our meetings sense that something is binding them. Sometimes when the saints come to the meeting early, they wait, looking at the clock until one of the responsible brothers stands up to formally begin the meeting. However, if we all came in with a released spirit, denying our mind, emotion, and will, we would begin to pray regardless of what time it was. We would simply pray to release our spirit, and the Holy Spirit would be released. If more saints came to the meeting, their spirits would also be released, and they would be burned because there would already be something burning in the meeting. Perhaps there would not even be the need for someone to announce a hymn or share a message. I am not saying that we should be without order. There must be a proper order, but this does not mean that we must be formal. To be proper is one thing, and to be formal is another. If we would simply release our spirit and give the Holy Spirit the opportunity to be released, the Spirit would have the freedom and the liberty in the meeting, and the spirits of the saints would be strengthened, refreshed, renewed, nourished, and satisfied.</p>
<p>This is what is on my heart. Our meetings need the release of the Spirit. We must break through all the barriers and bonds of our emotions, our mind, our will, and our forms. We must all exercise our spirit to overcome and conquer this kind of situation. When we come to the meetings, we should simply release our spirit. If the Spirit is released in our meetings, our meetings will always be rich. People will be attracted and drawn to the meetings, and the size of the meetings will constantly increase. We each must bear the burden and responsibility for this matter. It is not the responsibility of any one person but of everyone. If we do not take up this responsibility, it is meaningless for us to come together, because the purpose of our coming together is to exercise our spirit that the Spirit would be released and that the Lord would be exalted, magnified, exhibited, and glorified. When the Spirit is bound and suppressed, the Lord is very much limited and hindered. The devil, God&rsquo;s enemy, is the source of death, and his wish and desire is to bring death into the meetings. When there is death in the meetings, he is happy. Therefore, we must fight the battle against the devil. We must tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, we do not agree with death in the meetings. We do not agree that death would be so prevailing in our meetings.&rdquo; We must fight the battle with the help of the Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
