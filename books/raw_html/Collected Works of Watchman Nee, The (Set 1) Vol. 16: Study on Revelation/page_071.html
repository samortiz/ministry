<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Revelation 19:15</H2><P>"And out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He might smite the nations; and He will shepherd them with an iron rod; and He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty."</P><P>This verse mentions three things that the Lord does:</P><P>(1) "Out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword." This is the word that comes out of His mouth.</P><P>(2) "Shepherd them with an iron rod." This is mentioned three times in this book: here, in 2:27, and in 12:5. At the beginning of the kingdom, He will smite all the opposing authorities.</P><P>(3) "Treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty." This matches Revelation 14:17-20 and Isaiah 63:1-6.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Revelation 19:16</H2><P>"And He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS." </P><P>Because He rides on a horse, special reference is made to His thigh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Revelation 19:17-18</H2><P>"And I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come here; gather yourselves to the great dinner of God, that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of generals and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free and slave and small and great." </P><P>The marriage dinner of the Lamb is for those who are invited, while the great dinner of God is for the birds in mid-heaven.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Revelation 19:19-20</H2><P>"And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army. And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet, who in his presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone."</P><P>Here it speaks of the destinies of the beast and the false prophet.</P><P>(1) Verses 11 through 16 speak of how the Lord will fight and triumph.</P><P>(2) Verses 17 and 18 speak of how the birds eat the flesh of the defeated ones.</P><P>(3) Verses 19 and 20 speak of the end of the beast and the false prophet.</P><P>The false prophet has done three things. He has: (1) wrought miracles before the beast, (2) deceived those who had received the mark of the beast, and (3) deceived those who worshipped the image of the beast.</P><P>We should pay attention to the word "alive." It matches what we explained regarding 13:11-18. Both the beast and the false prophet are resurrected, and since their bodies cannot die twice, they are cast alive into hell.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Revelation 19:21</H2><P>"And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh." </P><P>This is the end of those who follow the beast. The Christians who follow the Lord faithfully will enjoy glory one thousand years earlier than the ordinary Christians. Likewise, those who follow Antichrist faithfully will suffer punishment one thousand years earlier than the other people.</P>
