   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO SPECIAL FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every sect or denomination has a special fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we Christians should have just one unique and common fellowship, the fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ 1 Cor 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we were saved, we were brought into the fellowship of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, as Christians we can have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The denominations, however, have a special fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, when certain Southern Baptists learn that others are Presbyterians, they would stop having fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They may talk with them about business or politics, but they will not have fellowship in common concerning spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those who insist upon the practice of foot washing also have a special fellowship, for they limit their fellowship to those within their own circle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Others limit their fellowship to those who have the same practice regarding the wine or juice used at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All this is sectarian, and we must abandon it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must abandon all special names, special teachings, special practices, and special fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>NO SEPARATE ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a particular locality there may be a group of Christians who have no special name, special practice, special teaching, or special fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, they may still have an administration separate from the church in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If so, that group is a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition to the local church in a city, an independent group may come into being that in nearly every respect is the same as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But that group may still insist upon having a separate administration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is like having two city halls in the same city.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But there should be just one city hall in a city.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If there is more than one, it is a sign of division.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a group of Christians has truly seen the ground of unity, they will say, "We cannot have a separate administration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must have one administration with the church that is already in this city."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as there is a city hall, it is impossible to have another one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you insist upon a separate city hall, you are a division.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>WILLING TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>WITH ALL THE LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps there is a group that has no special name, teaching, or fellowship and that does not insist upon its own administration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We still need to examine whether or not they are willing to open themselves to have fellowship with all the other local churches on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose those in this group say, "We have nothing special and we do not have a separate administration, but we don't like to have fellowship with the other churches."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If they say this, then they have become a local sect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are no longer a local church, for a local church is part of the Body, one among many other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, a genuine local church must be open to the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they isolate themselves from the other churches, they are a local sect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to study any group according to these five items.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today is a day of division and confusion, and we should not accept any group blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, we must check whether or not they have a special name, a special teaching, or a special practice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to see whether or not they insist upon their own administration, and we must inquire if they are open to all the local churches throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If they pass all these tests, then they are a genuine local church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if they cannot pass them, we must hesitate as far as recognizing them as a church is concerned.</S>
