   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All, especially Peter, had the assurance and the confidence that they would follow the Lord to the end, no matter what the pathway might be.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, what they did was the reverse Matt 26:56b, 69-75 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>28.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a Lamb Brought to the Slaughter</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>and as a Sheep Dumb before Its Shearers</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Isaiah 53:7 says, He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This prophecy is fulfilled in Matthew 26:62 and 63a: The high priest stood up and said to Him, Do you answer nothing?</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fact that Christ was executed with two criminals indicates that the Roman authorities considered Him a criminal.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>30.</S>
