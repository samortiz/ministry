   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the entire revelation of the sixty-six books of the Bible, the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is for God s dispensing....God s desire with His strong intention is to dispense Himself into His chosen people as their life, as their life supply, and as their everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To carry out this dispensing He needs to be triune.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Jeremiah 2:13 God refers to Himself as the fountain of living waters; in John 4:14 Christ is the fountain of water springing up in the believers into eternal life; and in Revelation 22:1 the Spirit is the flow, the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Father is the fountain, the source, and the Son is the spring as the course to express the source.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s move in man is altogether a story of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without the Spirit, there is no history of God because God is totally a matter of Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The difference between God s move, God s act, God s work, and religions is that religions do not have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They may have some spirits, but those spirits are demonic, devilish, and satanic.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is only one genuine, divine Spirit; that is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>74</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Old Testament The Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every story in the Old Testament is related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first story is concerning God s creation of the heavens and the earth, with millions of items, and His creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this story the Spirit of God is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Genesis 1:1 says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then the following verse says, The Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, we see that the Spirit was the Spirit of God in God s creation of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After His creation, God began to work on man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In God s work on man, His name is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Spirit of Jehovah is in God s reaching of men and in His care for men Judg.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God told Moses that His name was I Am Who I Am Exo 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means, I am always the thing which should be.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If there is the need of light, He is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there is a need of life, He is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus Himself told us that His name is I Am John 8:58 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The name I Am means that the very One who works on man is everything to man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He takes care of man and He comes upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is Jehovah in His reaching of man and in His care for man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit of Holiness</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is caring for man mainly to make man holy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be holy means to be separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>76 The Spirit of holiness refers to the nature and essence of God....</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, the Spirit of holiness is a description of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>77 Man s fall caused him to depart from God to become common, worldly, secular, and even dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So God needs to take care of man, making man separate from all things other than Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is to make man holy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, the Spirit in the Old Testament is the Spirit of holiness in God s making His chosen people holy unto Himself Psa 51:11; Isa 63:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not the same as the Holy Spirit, which is used in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Holy Spirit is more intensified than the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>78</S>
