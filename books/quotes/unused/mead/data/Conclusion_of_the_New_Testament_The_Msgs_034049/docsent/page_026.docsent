   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FORTY-TWO CHRIST HIS PERSON 22</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider further Christ s person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaac, the Son of Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Isaac, the son of Abraham, is a type of Christ Gen 17:21; Matt 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isaac was Abraham s son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A son is one who comes out of the father and who inherits all that the father is and has.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was Isaac s history.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was out of the father, and he inherited everything of the father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Isaac inherited all things from his father Gen 24:36; 25:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was by grace, not by effort, that Isaac became the heir of the father s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was not required to do anything in order to inherit these riches, and he did not do anything for the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was absolutely and unconditionally of grace that Isaac inherited all of his father s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this Isaac is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus, as the Son of God, came out of the Father John 16:28 and inherited all that the Father is and has John 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition to inheriting the riches of his father, Isaac secured a choice bride, Rebekah Gen 24:61-67 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He gained her without doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As he was meditating in the field, Rebekah was brought to him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Isaac was not a doing person; he was an enjoying person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His father and his servant did everything to secure a bride for him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Isaac did not even go to Rebekah; Rebekah came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rebekah, the wife of Isaac, is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the real Isaac, Christ has inherited all that the Father is and has, and He has obtained the church, the real Rebekah Eph 5:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lamb Provided by God</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ also fulfills the type of the lamb provided by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Genesis 22:8 Abraham prophesied that God would provide a lamb for a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Genesis 22:13 and 14 say, Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Bible horns signify fighting power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ has fighting power, but His horns were caught by a thicket, which signifies humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are the thicket, and Christ, the Lamb of God, was caught in us and could not escape.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the Lamb of God, Christ was willing to have His horns caught by humanity so that He might be offered as our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to Genesis 22, the lamb that replaced Isaac was provided by Jehovah-jireh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This title has two meanings: Jehovah will provide and Jehovah will see.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we have both provision and vision.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Within the Lord s provision we have vision.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What provision and what vision we have at the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ram provided by God in Genesis 22 typifies Christ as our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the ram was killed in place of Isaac, so the Lamb of God suffered crucifixion for us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The ram killed for Isaac typifies Christ, the Lamb of God, who was crucified for us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should have gone to the cross, but God replaced us with the Lamb as our Substitute 1 Pet 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1 Peter 1:19-20 we have the fulfillment of the type of the ram provided by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 19 refers to Christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can see from the typology in the Old Testament that the animal sacrifices were to be without blemish and without spot.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, a sheep that was to be offered as a sin offering had to be without blemish, without mixture; it also had to be without spot, without any wound.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The sheep offered as a sin offering was spotless and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Among all the human beings who have lived on earth only the Lord Jesus is without blemish and without spot.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually the words without blemish and without spot in 1 Peter 1:19 are Old Testament terms used with respect to sacrifices offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This verse indicates that Christ is the real sacrifice to be our sin offering and trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was offered for the redemption of the sins of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the Lamb without blemish and without spot, He shed His precious blood to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First Peter 1:20 goes on to say that Christ, the Lamb provided by God, was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in the last times for your sake.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be His redeeming Lamb John 1:29 for His elect according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This was done according to God s eternal purpose and plan; it did not happen accidentally.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, in the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, since the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain Rev 13:8 .</S>
