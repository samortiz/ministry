<h2 class="head4">Three</h2><p>The three of us went out into the streets for seven afternoons passing out gospel tracts and preaching. We hung up pictures and sang short songs. The bustling crowds would gather to listen as we shouted out the gospel. We took turns speaking. When one was preaching, the others would stand by his side and pray quietly. The audience came in groups and took turns listening. Some went, but others stayed. Each time we preached, two to three hundred people stopped to listen. We have not seen an outward result yet; we do not know whether anyone has received the word at this time or whether they will receive it later. However, we thank and praise the Lord! This is probably the first time the gospel has been preached outdoors in Ku-Jiu. No matter what, Christ was proclaimed. We believe that His inward working is never in vain. The Lord also gave us an opportunity to testify to those in the government. On the evening of April 10, we had the first table meeting in Ku-Jiu with Brother and Sister Gung. It was sweet even though the number was small! On the fifteenth we had a special gospel meeting in Brother Gung's house for the neighboring women. Three or four people raised their hands to show that they wanted to receive salvation. We had a meeting for more than three hours on the afternoon of the seventeenth. The first half was for preaching the gospel, and the second half was for a message on the Lord's second coming. Many brothers and sisters received this kind of truth joyfully. There was a table meeting in the evening. There were five brothers and two sisters from that locality in addition to the three of us. Six or seven of the brothers and sisters in Ku-Jiu have seen the truth of the local church and want to walk in the truth. May the Lord lead them through His own leading. On the last Lord's Day evening, we prayed together in one accord and committed the newly established church in Ku-Jiu and the responsible brothers (Brother Gung and Brother Ruan) to God and His word of grace (Acts 20:32). We left Ku-Jiu by train on the eighteenth and went to Shi-Ping. (It is a day's train ride from Ku-Jiu to here.) We are looking for God's own leading concerning the work here. We need to rise up to pray more for this, and we need the brothers and sisters in all the localities to pray as well. We will tell you the rest later. May the Lord's love be with you. Amen!</p><p>Your brothers in the Lord,<br />K. H. Weigh, Lin Kwang-tsao, Chen Hsi-wen</p><h2 class="head2">Soon to Enter Sikang Province</h2><p>Brother Huang Jung sent a letter from K'un-ming on April 20, saying, "Brother Hsu (Jung-jieh) and Brother Hu (Yi-ming) will soon put their luggage on their backs and enter Sikang province to preach the gospel. We have heard that the roads are dangerous and that the bandits are very numerous. We need to pray earnestly for our brothers who are pressing on without caring for their health and safety."</p><h2 class="head2">The Work in Ch'ang-Teh, West Hunan</h2><p>My health has not been good lately, so I plan to rest a week. I have stopped the Bible study for beginners temporarily. I am not completely clear about the way I will take in the future. In the past few weeks, the brothers and sisters have become low in spirit, and I do not know why. It is as if they have fallen into mud and cannot pull their legs out. I feel much pressure inwardly. I can see that the flesh is totally useless. If God does not give grace, who can bring anyone into spiritual reality? After passing through this trial, I have really seen that if the apostles do not have the power, all their work will become an outward endeavor and will be dead and burdensome. I really ask for God's mercy. I do not know why God has chosen such a useless vessel as myself. If I were not clear about God's call, I would throw up my arms in resignation. Many people have repented during this time of preaching the gospel. Some are students. Others are businessmen. Some are even opium smokers. There are also some who were possessed by demons. The Living Water Teahouse is next to a theatrical troupe, and one of the troupers marvelously received the Lord. He came to me one evening and said that he had been praying for a long time, asking Jesus to open the way for him to make a living doing something else. He no longer felt right about singing in the troupe. I felt that his word was sincere. Unfortunately, he moved to another place today, so I did not have the opportunity to care for him!</p><p>Han Fu-sheng<br />April 5<br />[Address omitted]</p>
