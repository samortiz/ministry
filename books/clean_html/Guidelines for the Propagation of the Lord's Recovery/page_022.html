<h2 class="head1">SUPPORTING THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</h2>
<p>There are many saints who want to serve full time. After we sounded the call, over one thousand two hundred saints signed up. Six hundred of these will serve full time, and the rest will serve part time. Half of the saints who signed up to serve full time are from Taipei. This may be the first time in church history that over six hundred full-timers and over six hundred part-timers came forward at one time to serve the Lord. The long-term living expenses of the six hundred full-timers will not be small. We need to pray concerning this.</p>
<p>Ten saints should be able to support one full-timer. In other words, one out of every ten saints should be a full-time serving one. Everyone in the church should participate in preaching the gospel, and we should also be able to match the gospel move with our material offering. We thank the Lord that the economy of Taiwan is strong and that the standard of living is high. There is no problem related to finances. However, the saints need to be faithful in material offering to match the Lord&rsquo;s move. In particular, the working saints need to endeavor to support the full-time serving ones. In this way we will all move on together.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MOBILIZING THE WHOLE CHURCH<br />
TO BUILD UP A MODEL</h2>
<p>You should not rely too much on my leading. If the Lord allows, I will visit twice a year and stay for at least one month when I visit. When I am here, you will not be able to sleep peacefully, because I will create a lot of work for you. Our goal is to mobilize the whole church. The full-timers are not the only ones who can have a part in the gospel activities and church services. Every one of us must have a part.</p>
<p>If everyone functions in the ways that we have fellowshipped, the whole church will be mobilized to gain people. In conclusion, we need to be aggressive to preach the gospel in our homes, to children, to students, and to those with whom we work. We also need to recover the dormant saints. In this way the church will increase. We also need to lead the brothers and sisters to focus on knowing the truth, growing in life, and living Christ. Moreover, the saints should also take part in the church life so that there will be a testimony of a golden lampstand in every locality. We will first spread the gospel where we live, and lead many people to salvation. Then the Lord may lead us to go to other countries.</p>
<p>This should be our common burden. From now on the churches in Taiwan need to rise up and take action. This will produce a model. Then all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will see this model and know how to spread and propagate in order to gain people. There are over five hundred churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on five continents. Apart from the Far East, there are over three hundred churches on the other four continents. There are over two hundred churches in Asia. Most of the churches outside of the Far East are not large. They may have an average of a hundred people. A model for propagation should be established in Taipei so that the whole earth can see how the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery increase in number.</p>
<p>How we promote this matter is important. It seems as if the world has become smaller, because what happens in one place can quickly spread to other places. Once the church in Taipei begins to practice, the five hundred churches will know. We must build up a model in Taiwan, because the condition in other places is not as favorable as the condition here. We need to pray for the spread of the gospel. We need to grasp this golden opportunity to participate in the move for the spread of the gospel through the propagation and increase. We also need to build up a model.</p>
