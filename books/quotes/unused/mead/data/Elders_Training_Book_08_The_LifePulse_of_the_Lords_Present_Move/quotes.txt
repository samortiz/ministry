[1]  Elders Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord s Present Move CONTENTS
[2]  Our prayer is that all the churches with all the saints would be brought into one accord for the Lord s move and that the life-pulse of the Lord s present move, which comprises the home gatherings, the truth lessons, the burden for full-timers, with all being either a job-dropping one or a money-making one, and the spreading of the gospel, would become a living reality in all the churches.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF MEETING To be gathered by the Lord into His name Matt 18:20.
[4]  Meeting in mutuality and in speaking 1 Cor 14:23a, 26; Heb 10:25.
[5]  Meeting to preach the gospel and teach the truth according to the revelation of God s New Testament economy Acts 2:42, 46; 5:42; 1 Tim 1:3, 4.
[6]  In the Lord s new move we must practice to have four things the home gatherings, the truth lessons, the full-time workers, and the spreading of the gospel.
[7]  Matthew 18:20 says that two or three are gathered into the Lord s name.
[8]  The Lord does not say that two or three meet together.
[9]  This indicates that when we come to meet we should not be the ones who take the initiative.
[10]  We must also meet to remember the Lord and worship God.
[11]  This is a crucial, basic principle which we have to practice.
[12]  In the church meeting we must do two things remember our redeeming Lord and worship our God the Father.
[13]  Whenever we remember the Lord, we have to be in His resurrection through His death that we may enjoy Him as a feast.
[14]  We must also realize that the New Testament way is in the principle of incarnation.
[15]  Do you believe that they spoke in tongues in the home meetings in every house, from house to house?
[16]  He also talked about the Lord s ascension when he said that God has made Him both Lord and Christ this Jesus whom you crucified v. 36 . Peter told the Jews that God exalted Jesus and uplifted Him to the heavens.
[17]  We need to ask what they did in their home gatherings.
[18]  Acts 5:42 tells us clearly that they taught and they preached.
[19]  Do you believe that they taught the Ten Commandments or something concerning God s creation?
[20]  TRAINING THE SAINTS TO MEET IN THE NEW WAY
[21]  My burden is that all the elders and the co-workers would endeavor to do one thing to train our people to take the way of meeting around a table before a tomb.
[22]  When I first came to the United States, I was not used to speaking English, but I was eventually forced to.
[23]  For this purpose I would also propose that every church should have a little training of singing.
[24]  After the Lord s table meeting, you could take fifteen minutes to refer the saints to the hymnal.
[25]  THE NEED OF ALL THE CHURCHES TO BE THE SAME,
[26]  The contents of Book 7 in this series were given as a preparation for this fellowship.
[27]  CHAPTER THREE HOME GATHERING 2 Exercising our spirit 1 Cor 14:32.
[28]  Prophesying speaking for God and speaking forth God 1 Cor 14:1, 3, 31.
[29]  First Corinthians 14:32 indicates that we need to exercise our spirit to prophesy.
[30]  We must spend a long time to train the saints in every locality.
[31]  You need to speak on these matters continuously as a kind of training for at least seven days; it is better to take two weeks.
[32]  Otherwise, whatever you do according to what you heard was going on in Taiwan and according to what you heard from my messages will just be a mere copying.
[33]  You must stir up every member in your locality to rise up to be profitable persons for the Lord s recovery, telling them that we are not here in any way or in any aspect to repeat the poor history of Christianity.
[34]  In the book of Hebrews Paul speaks concerning many high things regarding the superiority of Christ.
[35]  In 10:25 he says, Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.
[36]  CHAPTER FOUR HOME GATHERING 3 To prepare ourselves for the meeting 1 Cor 14:26.
[37]  Elders to labor in the Word 1 Tim 5:17.
[38]  Those whom we have observed who have practiced the home meetings may not have had much of the riches in life of Christ and the Spirit, yet they have gained people through the mutual care.
[39]  History proves this, today s situation testifies to this, and our experience over the last ten to sixteen years also confirms this.
[40]  We all should feel shameful that we have wasted the Lord s time and wasted His mercy, His grace, His riches, and all the divine truths He has delivered to us.
[41]  Yet we have to labor much, to fast, to pray, to wait on the Lord time after time, to have a thorough dealing with the Lord, and to have ourselves fully dealt with by the Lord.
[42]  This indicates that when we come to the church meeting, we should have something of the Lord to share with others, whether a psalm to praise the Lord, a teaching of the teacher to minister the riches of Christ to edify and nourish others, a revelation of a prophet, v. 30 to give visions of God s eternal purpose concerning Christ as God s mystery and the church as Christ s mystery, a tongue for a sign to the unbelievers v. 22 that they may know and accept Christ, or an interpretation to make a tongue concerning Christ and His Body understandable.
[43]  Who among all the elders has been really laboring in the Word?
[44]  It is not adequate simply to prepare a message for you to share.
[45]  The church needs a general meeting on the Lord s Day to take care of the ones who only would come on this day, and the church also needs the preaching of the gospel, the preaching meeting.
[46]  The church also needs to feed the saints at the Lord s table; after they come to the table, they still need spiritual food to nourish them.
[47]  You have to prepare the proper word as messages to be given in all the home meetings, in a big general meeting, in the classes teaching the truth, in the Lord s table meeting, at the prayer meeting, and for the gospel-preaching meeting.
[48]  CHAPTER FIVE THE TRUTH LESSONS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:4; 3:15; 2 Tim 2:2, 15 BEING IN ONE ACCORD WITH NO OPINIONS
[49]  The victories we have enjoyed in the past were one hundred percent due to the one accord.
[50]  I say this as an encouragement to all of us.
[51]  To carry on the Lord s recovery we do not need to have any opinion.
[52]  I believe that we realize that the leading in the Lord s recovery is absolutely according to the entire revelation of God s New Testament economy.
[53]  For the Lord s table meeting it would be good to select some good messages on life and on the life supply according to your study and memory.
[54]  I call these nourishing messages to bring in a certain amount of nourishment to all the dear saints who come to remember the Lord.
[55]  After the remembrance rendered to the Lord, a half an hour can be spared in the meeting to speak that short, nourishing message.
[56]  I have gone to some Lord s table meetings where this was practiced, and I must testify that I received much nourishment.
[57]  At this point, we want to focus our attention on the truth lessons.
[58]  In 1 Timothy 2:4 Paul tells us that God desires everyone who has been saved to be brought not just to a partial knowledge but to a full knowledge of the truth.
[59]  For so many years we missed the way to teach the truths in a lesson way, in a way of education, to let the saints have a basic knowledge of God s revelation.
[60]  HOW TO TEACH THE SAINTS BY THE TRUTH LESSONS
[61]  We must use the Lord s Day or what is popularly called Sunday since this day is generally a holiday throughout the earth.
[62]  Most people do not have to work on Sunday, so we must utilize this day to teach the truths to the saints.
[63]  I would propose that every church spend half of every Lord s Day on the matter of teaching the truth.
[64]  Every Lord s Day morning we may have a general meeting to take care of the Sunday goers and general attendants.
[65]  If I were to ask you when the books of the Bible were written and when these books were recognized as part of the Scripture, probably not many would be able to tell me.
[66]  You may treasure this book, yet many thoughtful people would ask you to tell them how this book was written.
[67]  You believe in the Bible, study it, preach it, and teach it, yet you do not know how it was written.
[68]  CHAPTER SIX THE TRUTH LESSONS 2 Scripture Reading: Rom 7:6; 2 Cor 3:6 THE STAGES OF THE LORD S RECOVERY
[69]  Since October of 1984 the Lord has started a new way among us for the carrying out of His recovery.
[70]  In the first twenty years or more we have gone through at least two or three stages, so our practice has changed at least two or three times.
[71]  In Brother Nee s writings, especially The Normal Christian Church Life, there are indications that the practice in the Lord s recovery did change.
[72]  Such a study confirmed very much to me that there must be a change among us.
[73]  We may not take a mule wagon, yet we still may use the DC-4 of about forty years ago.
[74]  But in the way to practice the church life, to carry out the Lord s recovery, to preach the gospel, and to teach the truth, you have to repudiate the old way to the uttermost.
[75]  If you do not have a change in the way of practice in the Lord s recovery, yet you would imitate the points, this will burst your church life.
[76]  The new way is first to build the church in, through, and based upon the home meetings, having the church life in the home meetings.
[77]  We do not care that much for having the church life in the big meetings.
[78]  We do not believe that it is possible to do so.
[79]  According to our experience and observation, the proper, adequate, one hundred percent church life could only be possible in the home meetings.
[80]  A message needs to be prepared for all the different kinds of meetings.
[81]  This does not mean that you pick up the thought, the idea, with the terminology from the Life-study Messages and our other publications and recompose them.
[82]  When you speak of the big meetings, you refer to them as the church meeting, indicating that subconsciously you do not consider the home gatherings to be the church meeting.
[83]  CHAPTER SEVEN FULL-TIME Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1; Acts 20:34; 18:3; 1 Cor 9:6-15; Phil 4:13-19; 1 Tim 5:17
[84]  The matter of being full-time has been very much misunderstood for centuries.
[85]  The common thought in Christianity is that being a preacher or a pastor is a kind of profession.
[86]  You have to be hired and people either pay you or they may fire you.
[87]  Romans 12:1 says, I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.
[88]  If you do not go full-time, how could your body be free to be presented to God as a living sacrifice?
[89]  That was a fulfillment of the Lord s word in Acts 1:8: But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria.
[90]  Another aspect of being full-time is shown in Philippians.
[91]  In Philippians 4:13 Paul says, I can do all things in Him who empowers me.
[92]  If you are thinking to take the full-time way, you must realize that it is only possible for you to do it in Christ who empowers you.
[93]  Another verse concerning full-time is 1 Timothy 5:17: Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.
[94]  You have to support them, but it does not mean you have to pay them.
[95]  There is no word even as a hint in the New Testament telling us that the church paid somebody to be their preacher or to be their elder.
[96]  If you still have a job, you will not be able to labor so well in your leisure time, after office hours, or on weekends.
[97]  CHAPTER EIGHT AS THE LORD S, LIVING TO HIM Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:20b-23; 7:22b-23a; Rom 14:7-9; 2 Cor 5:14-15 Hymns 473
[98]  The real meaning of being full-time is to live to Him.
[99]  To go full-time does not mean to drop your job and become a preacher.
[100]  It does not mean that you give up your business and become one who preaches the gospel or who labors in the word all the time.
[101]  As long as you are a believer, you have to realize you should be one living to Him.
[102]  Whatever you are, you are to Him; whatever you do, you do to Him; whatever you possess, you possess to Him; whatever you own, you own to Him; the money that you have, you have to Him.
[103]  If the Lord really wanted you to drop your job and you would not do it, you could still say that you were for the Lord.
[104]  Since October of 1984, I fully realized that we had become somewhat stuck in the Lord s recovery.
[105]  We held the Lord back very much, so we did not carry out His commission to the recovery.
[106]  I began to feel that I should ask the Lord to forgive me since I am considered by many of the saints as the one to take the lead in the Lord s recovery.
[107]  The Lord s commission is His recovery, and His recovery today is to recover Christ as life, to recover the church as our living, to recover the enjoyment of Christ as everything to us, and to recover all the significances of the church life for the purpose of not only preaching the gospel but also spreading the truth.
[108]  CHAPTER NINE FELLOWSHIP UNTO THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Luke 16:9-11; 1 Tim 6:17-19; 3 John 5-8; Phil 1:5, 6; 4:15-19 PLUNDERING EGYPT OF ITS GOLD
[109]  In this chapter we will consider more concerning the full-timers who would still remain in their job, their profession or business, to make money.
[110]  Those full-timers remain there to make a gain of the world s gold.
[111]  If I were there at Paul s time, I would have gone through all the churches to tell them that it was a shame that they would not have fellowship with the Apostle Paul unto the gospel Phil 1:5 .
[112]  All the full-timers who remain in their jobs and businesses need to have this kind of fellowship, a fellowship for the furtherance of the Lord s move through those who do not remain in businesses and jobs, but who are occupied all day with preaching and teaching for the spreading of the Lord s kingdom.
[113]  Train the saints who love the Lord so much.
[114]  Quite often when I receive a gift from a dear saint, I quote this verse as a conclusion to my letter of acknowledgment: My God shall fill every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
[115]  Because you are taking care of God s need, God would give you a great blessing in filling every need of yours according to His riches.
[116]  I hope that in your training you may have some time to read and speak all these verses to the saints that their eyes may be opened to have a view, according to God s New Testament economy, of the world situation, their business, and their making of money.
[117]  Philippians 4:15-16 says, And you yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the account of giving and receiving but you only; for even in Thessalonica you sent both once and again to my need.
[118]  I have been considering quite much the practical way to carry out this burden.
[119]  The full-timers will not be considered or discerned by a center.
[120]  Let every church examine, discern, and make a decision as to whether one is right and proper to drop his job and go full-time.
[121]  CHAPTER TEN SPREADING THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Matt 28:18-20; Mark 16:15-20; Luke 24:44-49; Acts 1:8
[122]  To spread the gospel is to preach the gospel.
[123]  Concerning the preaching of the gospel in the Scripture reading in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, I do not quote one verse, but a section.
[124]  Translators generally agree that the best manuscripts do not have Mark 16:9-20, but they also agree to leave this portion here.
[125]  Verse 15 reads, And He said to them, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation.
[126]  We have to realize when we go out to preach the gospel of the New Testament economy of God concerning this all-inclusive Person, the heaven and all the demons will be listening.
[127]  Hebrews 2:9 tells us He died to taste death on behalf of everything, not only for everyone but for everything of God s creation because God s entire creation was lost see note 9 2 in Hebrews 2 Recovery Version .
[128]  In the Lord s name they can cast out demons, in the Lord s name they will speak with new tongues, in the Lord s name they will pick up serpents, and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them.
[129]  In Luke 24:44, the Lord Jesus, as the One who was in resurrection and who had been given all the authority in heaven and on earth, said to His disciples, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all the things must be fulfilled which have been written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me. The law, the prophets, and the psalms are the three sections of the entire Old Testament.
[130]  Acts 1:8, a very brief yet all-inclusive verse, says, But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.
[131]  We have to thank the Lord that the Holy Spirit has come upon us already.
[132]  Verse 8 does not say that you shall be my preachers, but that you shall be my witnesses.
[133]  Any church which is a genuine local church standing on the ground of oneness and recognizing the other local churches as churches in one fellowship is a church, regardless of whether or not that church accepts the present new way.
[134]  If a church chooses not to practice the new way, that church does not cease to be a church.
[135]  However, if a church meeting properly would not take this present new way, then we still respect them as a proper church.
[136]  If a church opposes a little and yet still recognizes all the other churches on this globe for the fellowship in the Body, we would not only recognize but also respect and regard them as a genuine church among the many local churches.
[137]  I received a long letter of twenty-seven pages on the morning of our final day of fellowship in this elders training.
[138]  The first page is the contents of the letter and all the rest of the twenty-six pages are signatures.
[139]  AND THE TRAINING OF THE FULL-TIMERS RECONSIDERING THE ELDERSHIP IN EACH LOCALITY
[140]  In this chapter we want to fellowship some principles in the matter of handling the eldership in the churches.
[141]  The Lord has given us a new start with a new way to practice the church life.
[142]  You also may have discovered some younger brothers in your locality who are not in the eldership but who may be more useful in taking care of the church s leading.
[143]  Because we are honest and we are for the Lord s business, for the profit of the church, and for the recovery as a whole, we should have a sober consideration and proper evaluation of the need of the eldership in our locality.
[144]  During the eighteen years that I was with the co-workers under Brother Nee s leadership, I never caused any problem nor did I get involved with any problem.
[145]  By the Lord s mercy, I was a pure person.
[146]  The training of the young full-timers is needed.
[147]  Whatever we do, we should not be that confident or contented.
[148]  I hope that the brothers who have the burden to take care of the training of the young full-timers do it in this way.
