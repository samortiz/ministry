   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The interpretation of the image in Daniel 2 is a prophecy concerning the human governments from the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, until the time of the coming of Christ see pp.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>25-26 of The Organic Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ to Be the Organism of the Processed and Dispensing Triune God, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The feet of the image are part of iron and part of clay vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The iron signifies human power in government, especially in dictatorships and autocracies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The clay signifies the people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When iron is mixed with clay, the iron is weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the people rise up to call for democracy and freedom, as they have in eastern Europe in recent days, autocracy and dictatorship are weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, the recent events in eastern Europe are a further fulfillment of the prophecy in Daniel 2.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Daniel 2, a stone cut out without human hands smote the two feet of the image and broke them into pieces v. 34 . Thus, the entire image, the symbol of human government in the form of autocracy, was broken to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The stone that smote the image became the replacement for the image.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This replacement is Christ in His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the fulfillment of this prophecy, Christ will be enlarged to cover the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This enlargement will be the kingdom, and the kingdom will be Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The kingdom in its reality is here today see Hebrews 12:28, note 1, Recovery Version , but it has not yet been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Luke 17:20-21, the Lord Jesus said to the Pharisees, "The kingdom of God does not come with observation...For behold, the kingdom of God is among you."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time, Jesus was already among the people as the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This corresponds with Mark 4:26, where the Lord said, "So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The seed of life is the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This seed is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ as the seed of the kingdom has been sown into us, and this seed is growing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to Luke 19:12, the Lord Jesus as a certain man of noble birth went to a distant country the heavens to receive for Himself a kingdom and to return.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, the Lord has traveled to a distant country to receive for Himself a kingdom and to return.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, He is here growing within us until the kingdom is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may wonder whether the Lord is in the heavens waiting for the time of His coming, or is growing within us to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, His being manifested from within us is His coming, and His coming is just His being manifested from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the living saints on earth are filled with Christ, saturated with Christ, and grown into maturity in Christ, the kingdom as the great mountain will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We as believers have received the little Jesus, but we will inherit the enlargement of Jesus, which is the kingdom.</S>
