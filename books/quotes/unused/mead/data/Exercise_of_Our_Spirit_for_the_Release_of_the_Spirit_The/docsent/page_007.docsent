   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE NOT QUENCHING THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:16-19 THE BURNING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DEPENDING ON THE OPENING OF OUR BEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible uses many figures to describe the work of the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One figure is that of the living water John 7:38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Holy Spirit is constantly flowing within us as rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Another figure of the Holy Spirit is that of a fire that is constantly burning Rev 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must have both the flowing and the burning of the Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are several ways to quench a fire, and one way is to cut off its supply of air, the draft.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there is no draft, there is no way for the fire to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The burning of the fire depends on the draft.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For instance, suppose there is a fire in a stove.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we close off the chimney of the stove and close all the doors and windows, the draft will be choked off, and the fire will be quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we want the fire to burn in a full way, we must open the chimney and the doors and windows.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the fire can burn freely because there will be a draft, a current of air.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Similarly, the burning of the Spirit requires a spiritual draft.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not provide the Spirit with the draft, it will be impossible for the Spirit to burn in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fact is that the Holy Spirit is burning within us all the time, but in our experience the Spirit may not always be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is because we often close all the openings of our being and choke off the draft, causing the Spirit to be quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a very simple yet very vital matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To have much knowledge but lack the burning of the Spirit within is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is better to be simple, to be on fire, and to let the Holy Spirit burn in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE BURNING OF THE SPIRIT BEING MORE IMPORTANT THAN KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our problem today is that we lack the burning of the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason why we Christians are so dead, dormant, weak, cold, and passive is because the fire is not burning within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must open our being to let the draft in so that the Spirit can burn in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not need more knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, we should let go of our knowledge and be simple and burning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I was young, the Lord was constantly burning in me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Consequently, I was on fire every day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although I did not have the kind of meetings and help that we have today, the Lord s grace was upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There was no need for me to strive or struggle to overcome the worldly things because there was a fire burning within me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, after some time I was led to seek the knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Day after day for more than five years, I read and studied the Bible merely with my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I attended Bible studies and received much knowledge through them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I read many books and papers and learned about matters such as the seventy weeks at the end of Daniel 9.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the more I studied the Word in this way, the more dead I became.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, the flow of the Spirit stopped, and the burning was quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Spiritually, I was dead, and there was no flow or burning within me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With the Lord s help I realized that the way I had taken was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day I made up my mind and told the Lord, Lord, I have been wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I will give up this kind of studying and instead go to You to contact You and pray to You.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From that day on I gave up my studies and stopped going to the study sessions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, every day early in the morning, I went up to the top of a little mountain by my family s house.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As I walked up the mountain, I prayed, opening myself to the Lord and giving myself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the day I began to do this, the flow and the burning of the Spirit within me was recovered; there was something flowing and burning within me again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As Christians, this fire must be burning within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Being a Christian is not a matter of merely knowing things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Knowledge apart from the living person of Christ has killed us and is still killing us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more I have traveled in this country, the more I have discovered that there is too much doctrinal knowledge in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are good doctrines, bad doctrines, spiritual doctrines, and other sorts of doctrines, but regardless of whether they are good or bad, mere doctrines and knowledge can damage and kill rather than help.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible is not a book of mere doctrine or knowledge; it is the book of the living Word Heb 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not the tree of knowledge but the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we often take the Bible in the wrong way, taking it as knowledge and not as life John 5:39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>TAKING THE BIBLE IN THE WAY OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>BY PRAY-READING</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How can we take the Bible in the way of life?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we read the Bible, we should exercise our spirit to take in the Word instead of exercising our mind to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should pray over what we read, understand, and apprehend in order to digest it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After reading the Bible for five minutes, it may be good to pray for ten minutes, praying not concerning various matters but concerning what we have read.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should pray about what we read, pray with what we read, and pray to digest what we read.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we will realize that the Bible is not a book of knowledge but a book that is full of life and the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Scriptures clearly tell us that the word that proceeds out from the mouth of God is food to our spirit and is the element that we should receive and by which we should live Matt 4:4; John 6:57, 63 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, most of us use the Bible in a wrong way, using it as a book of knowledge to develop our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many Christians have received so much knowledge that it is difficult for them to be inspired by the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must learn that we need to exercise our spirit and pray more than we need to read or study.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have had much experience in this matter and know the difficulties in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many times while we are reading and studying the Word, it is difficult to stop reading to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thus, we must learn to read while we pray and pray while we read.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must make our reading our praying and our praying our reading.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Eventually, it will not matter whether we are reading or praying because our reading and our praying will be mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Also, we do not need to pray in a formal way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We can simply read and pray in a natural, spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead of exercising our mind, we should exercise our spirit.</S>
