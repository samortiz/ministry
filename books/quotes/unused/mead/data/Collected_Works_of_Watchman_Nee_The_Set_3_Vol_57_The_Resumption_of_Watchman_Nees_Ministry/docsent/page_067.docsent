   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY OF THE CHURCH AND THE WAY OF THE WORK Taking the Jerusalem Line</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Church and the Work Being One</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Witness Lee: What is the difference between the way of the church and the way of the co-workers?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Nee: We covered the way among us in 1937.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time we spoke of the difference between the local churches and the work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our line then began from Acts 13.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But during the past few years, we found our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We found that we have to begin from chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Acts of the Apostles begins with chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is wrong for us to pay attention to the difference between the church and the work before the church is ever built up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should start from the basis of the church and the work being one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our mistake lies in the order and the sequence; it is not a mistake in the truth itself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were not wrong in the truth, but we were wrong in the timing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our work must first return to the principle of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The starting point of the church is the work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the Lord there is first the church and then the giving of the gifts of the apostles and prophets and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Ephesians 4 the Holy Spirit and Paul did not even acknowledge the existence of the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The order there is first the ascending on high of the Lord, then the giving of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These gifts are given after the church has been produced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The prophets there do not include such prophets as Elijah, nor do they include such people as Peter before the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Peter was an apostle in two different ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One was before the formation of the church, and the other was after the formation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Peter in the Gospels is the Peter before the formation of the church, and the Peter in Acts 2 is the Peter after the formation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why we say that in Ephesians 4 there is first the church and then the work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before God, there is first the church and then the work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But on earth, there was first the work and then the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There were the apostles in Jerusalem first, then the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Afterward, there were deacons and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the church in Jerusalem there were first the deacons and then the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people become a deacon first and an elder afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some need to serve first in the matter of food before they can take care of the administration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The situation in Jerusalem is different from that of an ordinary church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There we have the elders, deacons, and apostles as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Consolidating the Work and Spreading the Fruit</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Please remember that Peter carried out his work in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only Philip was sent to Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Under normal circumstances, we should send all the Philips out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today the co-workers should come together and work in one place, whereas the brothers and sisters should be sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The believers in Jerusalem should go out everywhere for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do not migrate today, persecutions may come and force us out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>During the past years small meetings have been raised up in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These are not the works of the workers, but the works of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These brothers and sisters moved to these localities for the sake of their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Presently, small meetings have started everywhere, and we have to go back and deal with every one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our problem lies in the fact that we did not pay attention to the sending out of the workers from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why many local churches developed problems.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is true that the apostles should remain and work in Jerusalem, but their view should be enlarged to include other places.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church in Antioch is of a different principle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Antioch is the case of the church producing the work, whereas Jerusalem is the case of the work producing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today we should first come back to take the way of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later, we hope that some local churches can practice the principle of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First Corinthians 12 speaks of the Body on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It deals with the question of the church on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That is why it says that the apostles and the prophets produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today we need both principles.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the one hand, the church produces the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the other hand, the apostles produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If our work can progress along these two lines simultaneously, we will see great blessings ahead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand, we should consolidate the work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the other hand, as soon as people are saved, we should tell them that they live for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not wait until persecution arises.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should send them out immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the Lord's way.</S>
