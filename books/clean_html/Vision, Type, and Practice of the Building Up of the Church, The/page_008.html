<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AND THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>God desires to obtain a built-up house in this universe. The special and unique work that He is doing in the New Testament age is to build up His church. Immediately after being revealed to His disciples as the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;You are Peter [a stone], and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). This means that the Lord wants us to know that He is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and that He wants to build the church. Everything that the Lord has accomplished in the New Testament age is not merely to be known, received, and obtained by us. His ultimate goal is that we would become stones for the building of His church.</p>
<p>Very few people know what the church is. We have said that the church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23), the dwelling place of God (2:22), and a corporate new man (v. 15). These three expressions indicate that the nature of the church is related to building and that her condition is related to coordination. Hence, whenever we speak of the church, we should have the deep understanding that the church is coordinated and built. Just as the Body cannot exist without coordination, the church cannot exist without coordination. Just as there is no dwelling place without building, there is also no church without building.</p>
<p>It is not easy to find genuine coordination and building up among Christians in Christianity. There are various organizations with committees, boards of directors, boards of deacons, and boards of elders, but it is not easy to see coordination. There are opinions and disputes, but it is not easy to see a group of believers who are coordinated and built up together. Once in a meeting of a board of deacons, one member threw a Bible at another member. Some Christians may not throw the Bible at anyone, but they use the words in the Bible as weapons to attack one another. I am not being too much; these are real situations. These negative situations show that most Christian groups are not coordinated or built up. Hence, they do not have the reality of the church.</p>
<p>Concerning building and coordination, Ephesians 4 contains two excellent phrases: <em>being joined together</em> and <em>being knit together</em> (v. 16). Let us consider the structure of the meeting hall as an example. The wooden frames, window frames, and doorframes are firmly knit together because they are fitly joined together. At the end of 1955 Brother Angus I. Kinnear accompanied Brother T. Austin-Sparks to Taiwan and was amazed when he saw our meeting hall, because although there were many doors and windows, he did not see the posts that supported the meeting hall. I told him that the posts, windows, and door frames were all fitly joined together; hence, although there had been many typhoons and earthquakes, the meeting hall was able to withstand them.</p>
<p>The meeting hall was able to withstand the typhoons and earthquakes because its components were fitly joined together and firmly knit together. If the meeting hall had only one wooden pillar, the meeting hall would have fallen even without typhoons or earthquakes. Although the meeting hall was constructed with wood, the beams and posts were all joined and knit together into one structure. Every piece of wood on its own appears to be insubstantial and weak, but as a whole they are firm because they have been fitly joined. Hence, the meeting hall will not fall when the wind blows or collapse when the earth shakes.</p>
<p>Similarly, many people are amazed that although the brothers among us are ordinary and are not famous preachers or pastors with doctor of divinity degrees, we nonetheless have been greatly blessed by God. I often use the human body as an illustration. A human being is solid because he has a skeletal frame that does not consist mainly of big bones but of small bones. These bones are worthless when they are separated, but when they are coordinated together and built up into one single structure, they become functional. This is the reason that we have God&rsquo;s blessing. We are all very ordinary, but we have the blessing because we are coordinated together.</p>
<p>Our meeting hall may not be impressive, but it is functional. If this meeting hall were to be taken apart, the individual pieces of wood would have little usefulness and would be considered waste material. However, when these pieces of wood are coordinated, joined, and built together, they become a very useful meeting hall. This is the preciousness of being coordinated and built together.</p>
<p>Many years ago all the halls in the church in Taipei participated in preaching the gospel. A number of ministers, who came from the denominations to observe, wondered how so many people could come to hear the gospel, even though we had not advertised the speakers in the newspaper. I laughed and told them that our speakers were not famous and did not have theological degrees; hence, they were not worthy of advertising. Sometimes the saints, including the ushers and those distributing gospel tracts, did not know who would be speaking, even when the meeting was about to start. This was amazing to others, but to us it was the coordination of all the &ldquo;useless&rdquo; pieces of wood together so that they could become a useful house.</p>
<p>These examples should help us to see that we have God&rsquo;s blessing because there is building among us. Of course, our coordination and building up are still inadequate. If we were more solidly built, God would definitely pour down more blessing. It is true that in our gospel meetings most saints do not know who will speak until a brother goes up to the podium. Instead of caring for who is going to speak, we should focus our attention on whether or not we are coordinated and built up together. It is the building that brings in the blessing, not the speaker.</p>
<p>The overseas saints think that I am the only person who gives messages in the church in Taipei. However, there are many brothers who speak in coordination in the different halls. Not only so, the various services in the meetings are carried out by all the saints coordinated together. I once attended a gospel meeting in one of the halls. While I was not too far away from the hall, a brother with a gospel vest gave me a tract and invited me to hear the gospel. He did not recognize that I was a brother, so he accompanied me all the way to the hall and handed me over to one of the ushers at the door of the meeting hall. I rejoiced at this experience because it proves that we are coordinated. People can see a situation in which I am not serving alone, but several brothers are serving together. This service rendered by all the saints coordinated together is the building.</p>
<p>The Lord does not need spiritual giants in His church. He needs every member. Hence, instead of being concerned about whether the members are small, our concern should be whether they are built up together. Once the members are built up, even the smallest ones will be useful. First Corinthians 12:23 says that &ldquo;those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor,&rdquo; and verse 22 says, &ldquo;Much rather the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.&rdquo; Medical doctors know that the small members of our body, which we consider to be of little use, are often the most indispensable. I hope this word will strengthen us to see that in this age spiritual giants cannot satisfy God&rsquo;s desire; rather, it is the built-up church that He desires and that brings in His blessing and presence.</p>
