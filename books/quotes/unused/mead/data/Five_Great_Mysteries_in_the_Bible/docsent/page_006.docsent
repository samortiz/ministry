   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Beauty</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another characteristic of the divine attributes is beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The universe created by God is truly beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only a God of beauty can create a beautiful universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose your lawn were not green but black.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You would see blackness when you go into your yard, and you would see blackness when you step out of your house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Would you consider that beautiful?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Would you like to have such a lawn?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The most beautiful thing is to have green trees, green grass, and red flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How beautiful, how pleasant to the eyes, and how refreshing are the scenes we see today!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Orderliness</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, everything in the universe is orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today's scientific research tries to discover the laws and principles in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since there are laws and principles, there must be one who makes them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If there are laws in a country, there must be a legislature or congress.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How could there be laws without lawmakers?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How could there be laws and principles in the universe unless it is God who has set them?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The moon, the sun, the earth, and the stars revolve within their orbits without colliding.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the earth were a little closer to the sun, we would be burned; if it were a little farther from the sun, we would be frozen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Who defines these things?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who causes the universe to be so orderly, without any confusion?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All these things speak forth God's masterpiece and declare God's invisible, eternal power and divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>GOD AS A DIVINE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man can perceive the invisible things of God by observing the visible things created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both the eternal power of God and the divine characteristics that express God's intrinsic nature are manifested in God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, this is still not God Himself as a divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is referred to in Colossians 2:9 is the Godhead, God's person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The characteristics of God's nature, referred to in Romans 1:20, can be verified through the created things; however, the created things cannot manifest the Godhead and person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only the living person of Jesus Christ, the Word who is God and who declares God John 1:1, 18 , can express God's Godhead and person, that is, the very God, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What the Lord Jesus Christ reveals is much deeper than what the universe verifies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is verified by the universe is only the outward manifestation of God's nature, not His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only what is revealed and declared by the living person of the Lord Jesus Christ is God's Godhead and person, that is, the very God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before we were saved, we could see the characteristics of God's nature manifested through the universe, so that we were without excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After we have believed in the Lord Jesus, it is in Christ that we know the divine Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The divine characteristics, which are outward, are manifested through the created things; the divine Godhead, which is God Himself, is lived out through the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>GOD UPHOLDING AND BEARING ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are countless items in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In such a boundless and mysterious universe, who is maintaining, managing, upholding, and propelling it?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hebrews 1:3 says, "Who upholding and bearing all things by the word of His power."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus upholds, bears, and propels all things not by His work but by His instant word, the word of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In creation all things came into being through Him as the Word John 1:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The universe has been framed by the word of God Heb 11:3 : "For He spoke, and it was; / He commanded, and it stood" Psa 33:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God speaks and upholds all things with His word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to Greek grammar, this upholding is continuous, unceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Greek word for upholding implies several rich meanings, including maintaining, operating, managing, controlling, and even propelling.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus as the Mighty God maintains, operates, manages, controls, and propels all things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He not only upholds all things for their mere existence but also maintains and propels them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This may be compared to a huge airplane.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once the engines are started, the airplane is upheld and maintained in the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today no one can deny that the mystery of the universe is with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is the meaning and center of the universe; He is the purpose of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Without God, the entire universe is empty and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The meaning of the universe is the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As the living Spirit, He is omnipresent, and He is also a divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You need only to open your heart and pray to Him, and He will enter into you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then you will become a person with meaning, and you will enjoy God as the mystery of the entire universe.</S>
