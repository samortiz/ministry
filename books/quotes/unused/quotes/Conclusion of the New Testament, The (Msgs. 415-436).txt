In Revelation 5 one of the elders introduced Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, but when John turned to see Him, he saw a Lamb
Now sin is over, Satan has been terminated, and we have been redeemed and rescued from the usurping hand of the enemy
He died on the cross as the Lamb of God to redeem us, but even after being redeemed, we are still mixed with many negative things
Eventually, our experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Lion-Lamb is related to the New Jerusalem, the goal of God's eternal economy
The lion is a symbol of Christ, portraying Him as a strong fighter against the enemy, as prophesied in Genesis 49:8-9
If a painting portrays only the main subject without a background or environment, we may think that the artist is not very skillful
The twenty-two chapters of Revelation are a good painting of the Lion of the tribe of Judah, but they also show an environment
When John saw the situation in heaven, he wept, but when the Lion of the tribe of Judah came, there was great rejoicing
Eventually, the Lion as the Lamb marries a bride, the bride becomes a square city, and the Lamb sits on the throne with God
Out of this throne flows a river of water of life, bright as crystal, and in the river the tree of life is growing
In the book of Revelation we should see only one figure, Jesus Christ, because this book is the revelation and unveiling of Jesus Christ
Christ is typified as a young lion conquering the enemies, a satisfied lion, and a lioness resting in conquest
Verse 9 says Judah is a young lion From the prey my son you have gone up and verse 8 says Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies
Judah, likened poetically to a young lion, is a type of Christ as the ultimate Overcomer, the fighting, victorious Lion
The expression you have gone up implies that the young lion first had to come down from the mountain to the plain to capture his prey
According to the poetry of Genesis 49:9, after devouring His prey, Christ was satisfied and couched to enjoy His rest
We need to see and experience Christ not only as a young lion but also as a couching lion who lies down to rest
He went to the cross and captured them, and in resurrection He led a train of vanquished foes to the heavens for His enjoyment
We need not be troubled by anything; instead, we simply need to enjoy this victorious, satisfied, and resting Christ
Christ is not only the fighting lion and the resting lion but also the producing lioness who brought forth many overcomers as His lion cubs
If we see the situation from God's viewpoint, we will realize that in the eyes of God the church is a country of lions
That no one dares to rouse Judah up signifies that Christ's terrifying power in His resurrection and ascension has subdued everything
If toward sin, the world, and Satan we are strong and bold like lions, God will be able to establish His reign through us
While in Revelation 5 we see that Christ is the Root of David in Isaiah 111 and 10 we see that Christ is also a sprout and branch of Jesse
Isaiah 11:10 says, 'In that day the root of Jesse, / Who stands as a banner to the peoples- / Him will the nations seek'
As the Root of David, Christ is more powerful and more victorious than David and has more of God's divine authority
These verses say, 'Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them, saying, What do you think concerning the Christ?
Revelation 5:6 speaks of 'a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God'
After Christ passed through death, resurrection, and ascension, He stood in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures
He is not sitting or sleeping there; instead, He is standing, and His seven eyes are flashing, watching, searching, and even burning
The four living creatures, the twenty-four elders, myriads of angels, and all other creatures are wide-awake, alert, and observing
In His earthly ministry Christ accomplished redemption; now in His heavenly ministry He is accomplishing God's building work
The center of God's building is the church, and the ultimate consummation of this building is the New Jerusalem
Christ's earthly ministry began from His being baptized in water and anointed with the Holy Spirit and ended in His resurrection
The major items in the section of His earthly ministry are His human living, His crucifixion, and His resurrection
Christ's heavenly ministry began from His outpouring of the Holy Spirit and will end in His second appearing on the earth
In His heavenly ministry, as such a Victor, He will conquer all His enemies and bring in His kingdom to this earth
Revelation 5:6 also says that the Lamb has 'seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth'
The seven eyes of Christ are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth, and they run to and fro through the whole earth
Of trying to understand the Triune God according to our human mind, we must understand Him according to the teaching of the Bible
The fact that the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God indicates that the Spirit is the eyes of the Son
Since the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of Christ , the Spirit and the Son are distinct yet not separate from each other
In Exodus 17 Moses was instructed to strike the rock with his staff, and the water flowed out of the smitten rock
The striking of the rock by Moses' staff signifies that Christ was put to death on the cross by the authority of God's law
The living water and the rock are two yet one; they are indivisible, just as the eyes and the body are inseparable
The Lamb is on the throne, from the throne flows the river of water of life, and in the water of life grows the tree of life
By this we can see that Christ is the lifegiving Spirit not only for us to know and understand but also for us to take experience and enjoy
We must exercise not only our mind to understand Him but also our spirit to contact Him in our spirit, as revealed in the Epistles
The seven eyes of Christ, the seven Spirits of God, are Christ's expression in a judging way in God's move for God's building
Because He loves the church, He comes to search, enlighten, judge, refine, and purify us in order to transform us into precious stones
The seven Spirits, as the intensification of the Triune God, are the seven eyes of the Lion-Lamb to carry out God's New Testament economy
The Spirit is the seven eyes of the Lamb that can see into things clearly and the seven lamps that are burning and full of light
By the seven Spirits of God as the seven lamps of fire, we experience something shining in us to search out every secret of our entire life
The seven eyes of the Lamb in Revelation 5:6 are the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne in Revelation 4:5
On this throne there is the one God, and before this throne there are seven lamps, which are the seven eyes of God, the seven Spirits of God
Wherever there are God's lamps of fire, there is the presence of God, and wherever there are God's lamps of fire, there is God Himself
Eventually, the result of the burning of the fire of God will be a group of people who are completely the same as God
When we are filled with the Spirit, we are filled with the element of God, and this element, which is God Himself, is a consuming fire
Just by going to one meeting, we may begin to sense the living observation of the sevenfold intensified Spirit
The burning, searching, enlightening, and observing reality of Christ as the life-giving Spirit is in the churches
After the seven Spirits of God as the seven lamps of fire burn within us, in our experience they become seven eyes
If we live properly as children of God, His eyes will be lovely, but if we are disobedient, His eyes will be fearful
Regardless of whether His transfusion is that of love or of fear, as He looks at us with His eyes, God is transfused into us
The seven eyes of the Lamb are in the church; hence, in order to receive the transfusion of the seven eyes, we must be in the church
Eventually, our function is manifested in the church, and we grow in life and are built up together with others
When two very intimate people speak with one another, they may not necessarily use their mouth; instead, they may use their eyes
If we do not allow the seven Spirits to refine us, the seven Spirits have no way to shine, and there is no testimony
The more we let the Spirit purify us and refine us, the more He shines through us, and this shining is the testimony of the churches
The Lord Jesus, as the building stone, was engraved, dealt with, by God on the cross for the iniquity of God's people
Zechariah 4:10 tells us that the seven eyes on the stone are the 'eyes of Jehovah running to and fro on the whole earth'
After speaking of seven lamps upon a golden lampstand in verse 2, Zechariah asked an angel in verse 4, 'What are these'?
As we have seen Zechariah reveals that the seven eyes of God which are the seven lamps on the lampstand are also the seven eyes of the stone
By means of the seven eyes, Christ as the Lion and the Lamb unveiled in Revelation 5 is connected to the stone spoken of in Zechariah 3
He is the Lion-Lamb-stone; the Lion to destroy the enemy, the Lamb to redeem us, and the stone to build God's house
The Lamb's seven flaming, searching, and enlightening eyes are not only for God's judgment but also for His building
The seven lamps in Exodus 25 are for the building up of the tabernacle, especially for the move in the tabernacle
The seven lamps, therefore, are for the building up of the tabernacle, God's dwelling place among men on earth
The seven Spirits, which are the seven eyes of the Lamb and the seven lamps before God's throne, are for God's building
The New Jerusalem, God's eternal dwelling place, issues out of this judgment carried out by the seven flaming eyes of the Lamb
God's judgment is carried out by Christ's being the One with seven flaming eyes to burn, enlighten, search, purify, and refine us
The seven lamps of the lampstand are the seven eyes of God, the seven eyes on the stone, and the seven eyes of the Lamb
The lampstand is for shining, the stone is for building, the Lamb is for redeeming, and God is for administrating
The lamps of burning fire are for God's administration, and the eyes are for the redeeming and building One's transfusion
On the one hand, these seven Spirits are seven lamps shining, burning, searching, judging, and carrying out God's administration
On the other hand, these seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the redeeming and building Christ to infuse whatever Christ is into us
In the whole universe no one is worthy to open the mystery of God's economy but Christ, the overcoming Lion and the redeeming Lamb
We must realize that, according to Revelation 5, Christ's worthiness is a matter of His being qualified to open the secret of God's economy
In Revelation 5 Christ as the Lamb of God was standing in the midst of the four living creatures and the elders
Christ as the Lion-Lamb is qualified to open the scroll, that is, to open the mystery of God's economy and to carry it out
We all must worship Christ as the Administrator, as the One in the heavens administering all things for the fulfillment of God's economy
In Revelation 5 Christ is presented as the redeeming Lamb who is the Victor, qualified to take the scroll, open it, and execute it
In the Epistles of Paul, the scroll is the new testament mainly for our enjoyment of the riches of Christ, which have been bequeathed to us
How God deals with all peoples, including the Jews, the nations, and Christendom, will be according to His testament
The Jews, the heathen nations, and Christendom will be dealt with, and God's kingdom will be ushered in on the earth
A day will come, however, when the whole universe will be in order, and there will be no more division, confusion, darkness, death, or tears
All the different races and people with all different ranks have been put into the Spirit so that they all may be one Body
He created man with His image that man may be His expression, and He committed His authority to man that man may be His representative
When we enjoy Christ in such a way, we will have the priestly function of always ministering Christ both to God and to man
Our church life will be very healthy and normal, and spontaneously out of this situation the authority of God will be realized
According to the New Testament, the goal of God's salvation is to make all those who believe in Christ priests of God
If a person is saved but fails to become a priest to serve God, he cannot fulfill God's purpose or satisfy His desire
According to Revelation 5:12, Christ is the Lamb who is worthy to receive the power, riches, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing
When the Lord Jesus took the scroll and was about to open its seals, two hosts in the universe worshipped and praised Him
After His ascension, Christ is worshipped as the conquering Lion and has been enthroned with royal authority as the King of kings
According to verses 2 and 6 of Exodus 3 the Angel of Jehovah the sent One was Jehovah Himself the sending One and Jehovah is the Triune God
No matter how much this earth is judged by Christ in God's administration, He will take care of the chosen Israel and the redeemed church
It does not matter what the other nations say or do, for the nation of Israel is under the care of Christ's universal administration
In His work as another Angel, Christ not only takes care of Israel but also cares for the redeemed saints of the church
In verse 3 Christ says, 'Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we seal the slaves of our God upon their foreheads'
According to prophecy and their present situation, the children of Israel have returned to the land of their fathers in unbelief
When the Lord Jesus came, God changed the dispensation from that of keeping the law to that of believing in the Lord Jesus
The Jews would not accept this change, and they refused to turn from keeping the law to believing in the Lord Jesus
God, however, is sovereign, and He will always take care of the nation of Israel, not for their sake but for His economy
By shepherding the flock of God, Christ accomplishes a great part of God's organic salvation, His salvation in life
In His shepherding the flock of God, the main thing Christ does is to guide us to the many different springs of waters of life
They have in their hands palm branches which signify the victory of the saints over tribulation which they have undergone for the Lords sake
These dear ones, who love God and seek Christ at any cost, gain the supply of living water, which is God Himself
Many believers have been sustained by the Lord to overcome all obstacles and to come to the springs of the waters of life
We need to praise the Lord for bringing us to the church, where there is a fountain which is God Himself, the source of living water
It is when we are full of this thirst-quenching water that we can easily overcome whatever comes across our path
Christ is revealed as another Angel who presents the prayers of the church to God and carries out the answers to these prayers
In the administration of God's judgment upon the earth, Christ is the Angel standing in the position of One who has been sent by God
The first altar in Revelation 8:3 refers to the altar of burnt offering , and the golden altar before the throne refers to the incense altar
In Revelation 8 we see Christ as the Priest burning the incense with the fire from the altar of burnt offering
The only fire that could be used to burn the incense was the fire from the altar of burnt offering, the heavenly fire that came from God
Without the altar of burnt offering we do not have the ground to burn the incense, that is, to fellowship with God
The blood shed upon the offering altar is brought into the Holy Place to be sprinkled upon the four corners of the incense altar
Without passing through the cross, no one can be before God and have prayer which is a fragrant incense that is acceptable to God
Strange fire is our natural emotion, our natural enthusiasm, our natural energy, or our natural effort in prayer
The burning on the burnt offering altar was a burning of judgment, but the burning on the incense altar was a burning of acceptance
In particular, the first kind of sweet savor, that from the altar of burnt offering, is reflected in the second, that from the incense altar
The sweet savor that ascended to God from the altar of burnt offering is reflected in the savor that ascended to Him from the incense altar
At the outer altar Christ, as the reality of all the offerings, satisfies all the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory
As a result, fire comes down to earth to execute the divine judgments recorded in the remainder of the book of Revelation
It is important for us to see that the execution of God's administration is motivated by the prayers offered to Him from the incense altar
On the other hand, with respect to God's dispensing, it is the throne of grace, the place where God dispenses His grace to people
The throne in Revelation 4 and 5 is the throne of authority, the throne of the divine administration over the entire universe
Christ's interceding life, signified by the incense altar, is the center of the divine practice, the divine administration
When the prayers of the saints ascend to God with the incense of Christ, God executes the policies of His administration
Today before God, not only is the individual Christ interceding, but the corporate Christ, the Head with the Body, is interceding as well
The prayers in Revelation 8 are no longer merely the prayers of the individual Christ but the prayers of the corporate Christ
Whenever we open our mouth to pray at the incense altar, the prayer that will issue forth will not be personal, individual prayer
At that time we will be, in our experience, a real member of Christ, a genuine part of the Body-Christ, the corporate Christ
It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us'
If it were not for Christ's intercession, no one would accept His death, experience His resurrection, or be one with Him in His ascension
In order for people to be motivated to experience Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension, His intercession is necessary
All these experiences are dependent on the motivation that comes from the interceding Christ and the interceding church
If we consider the diagram of the tabernacle and the outer court, we will see that the incense altar is the center
If we do not have the center the incense altar none of the aspects of the tabernacle and the outer court will be effective in our experience
In our experience we need to come to the altar, the laver, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the Ark
We need to let Him pray in us, allowing Him to guide us into prayer and into the enjoyment of Him as our prayer
Christ has a great deal of incense, but where are the prayers that are qualified to receive the incense of Christ?
As those who are seeking the Lord, we in the recovery, both individually and corporately, must learn one thing-to pray
Thousands and thousands of prayers are offered to God by Christians, but there is very little execution of God's purpose
Today we need to learn to pray in such a way as to motivate the throne of grace to dispense God's life supply as grace to all the needy ones
It may help us to pray more if we realize that we do not need to pray in a formal way; we do not need to offer natural, religious prayers
In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as another Angel in Revelation 8
Revelation 8:4 says, 'The smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the Angel before God'
The smoke of the incense indicates that the incense is burned and ascends to God with the prayers of the saints
In other words, smoke indicates that the saints' prayers are effective because Christ has been added to them as incense
The smoke of the incense goes up with the prayers of the saints to the throne of God, and the prayers are answered
The incense typifies the resurrected and ascended Christ, the unique One who is received by God and acceptable to Him
If we see that to burn the incense is to pray Christ, we will be ashamed of the way that we have often prayed in the past
In Exodus 30 we first have a picture of the ointment ; then immediately following is another picture showing us the incense
It is that of two-way traffic, the coming and the going; the ointment is coming to us, and the incense is going to God
We should have a two-way traffic in which Christ comes to us as the ointment, and He also goes back to God as the incense
Revelation 8 clearly shows us two things: the prayers of the saints and Christ as another Angel bringing much incense
The incense refers to the resurrected Christ with His merits-all that He is, all that He has accomplished, and all that He does
As long as we receive the redemption of the blood and are in the termination of the cross, Christ is joined with us
As we saw in the previous message, in order to pray at the altar of incense, we must first experience the altar of burnt offering
In our experience of the altar of burnt offering, we need to have a full realization concerning the blood and the ashes
One aspect is signified by the blood shed on the altar, and the other is signified by the fire burning on the altar
As the ashes and the coals of fire are mixed together, eventually, what the offerer sees is just the blood and the fire
The coals of fire on the incense altar and the coals of fire on the burnt offering altar are also one and the same
In other words, the blood on the incense altar inside is based on the blood on the burnt offering altar outside
If a person has not been sprinkled by the blood, before God he is just like Cain, who could neither be accepted by God nor pray
A person who goes before God to pray not only needs the redemption of the blood; he also needs to be one who has been consumed at the cross
Consequently, not only were their prayers not accepted by God, but even they themselves were struck dead by God
A man may be able to pray a great deal before God, but he should not be overconfident that all his prayers are acceptable to God
A person who knows how to pray is always one who has been both redeemed under the blood and terminated on the cross
Suppose we wish to pray concerning the gospel, our family, the giving of material things, or the matter of marriage
We need to keep in mind that the fire that burns on the burnt offering altar is the same fire that burns incense on the incense altar
If we have not been terminated in a certain matter yet bring that matter into the presence of God in prayer, it is a great offense to God
If we have not been terminated by the cross concerning a certain person, then we are not qualified to pray for him
We need to remember that whenever man goes to burn incense at the incense altar, he must fulfill two basic conditions
If we recognize that many prayers are prayers of strange fire, we will see that those prayers are neither necessary nor right
We will not dare to pray those prayers which are for ourselves and not for God's sake, because they are initiated by us, not by God
Ashes mean that everything has been terminated, yet the fire that burns the ashes is still there to burn the incense before God
We first pass through the redemption of the cross before God, accept the termination of the cross, and truly become ashes before God
If we truly have a vision of this, we will prostrate ourselves before God, confessing our filthiness and naturalness
When we thus allow the cross to terminate us, in a practical way we can experience Christ's coming forth from us
Man may go before God to burn incense, that is, to utter prayers before God by drawing near to God and contacting God
According to the type in the Old Testament, man's going before God to burn incense is entirely a matter in resurrection
For our prayer to be acceptable to God and be considered by God as a sweet-smelling savor, it must be in resurrection and ascension
Many Christians are praying outside the spirit because they do not apply Christ as all the different offerings
Sometimes we may enjoy Christ before God by reading His Word, and we may take Christ in by pray-reading the Word
What we need is the priesthood with the priestly function, that is, to burn the incense through all the offerings
Today the church's urgent need is for all believers to practice the priestly office of burning the incense in the presence of God
In this expression of Christ, we will commune and converse with God in order to bring ourselves into God and God into us
Something very sweet ascending to God and something very glorious descending into us will saturate us and make us the genuine priesthood
If we attend to this kind of priestly office individually and corporately, there will be a great change in life and expression among us
The altar in the expression the fire of the altar refers to the altar of burnt offering, from which the fire was taken
In Leviticus 161213 Aaron was instructed to burn the incense with the fire that burned the offerings on the bronze altar in the outer court
The answer to the prayers was Christ's casting of the fire of the altar to the earth, which fire became God's judgment upon the earth
Thunders, voices, lightings, and an earthquake imply the answer to the prayers of the saints, including the prayer mentioned in Luke 18:7-8
At the end of this age, people will be so rebellious against God that some will even declare to the whole universe that they are God
When we pray like this, the Angel sent by God will minister to God with our prayer, adding to it Himself as the incense
It is after the prayers of the saints in verses 3 through 5 have been answered that the seven angels are prepared to trumpet
The answer to the saints' prayers is the execution of God's judgment upon the earth by the seven trumpets that followed
The kingdom of Christ will be everlasting in that it will last not only for a thousand years but for eternity without end
The Lord's reigning forever and ever is the Lord's reigning in the millennial kingdom and in the new heaven and new earth for eternity
All the overcomers will reign with Christ for a thousand years , and all the saved ones will reign forever and ever in eternity
After Christ executes His judgment upon the nations at His coming back, the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of Christ
Revelation 11:15 says, 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever'
He paid the price on the cross to purchase the entire earth so that one day the kingdom would be established on it
They are those who will heed the eternal gospel, fearing God and worshipping Him and not worshipping Antichrist and his image
He will judge the living after He fights the war at Armageddon and destroys Antichrist, the false prophet, and their followers
Many think that this judgment refers to the judgment exercised upon Christians to determine who is real and who is false
Matthew 25:32 goes on to say, 'He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats'
Today the enemy, Satan, is still in the heavens, but once the overcomers arrive there, he will have no place but will be cast down
To be a Christian is not merely a matter of being holy and victorious; it is a matter of submitting to the authority of the kingdom
When there is a group of overcomers in the church, these overcomers will bring the authority of heaven, the kingdom of God, to the earth
We may pray for numerous things, but unless the ultimate purpose is for God's kingdom, those prayers are of no value before God
There is a loud voice in heaven saying Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ
In Babylon Daniel was praying precisely for this matter so that God's kingdom might be brought back once more to the earth
It was completely due to Daniel's prayer that God was able to build the temple, restore Jerusalem, and have the dominion
Since we are in the reality of the kingdom now, we will certainly be in the manifestation of the kingdom in the future
In Revelation 1:9 John tells us that he was our brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus
When we live in the reality of the kingdom in its ultimate state, that will be the manifestation of the kingdom
The normal church life is simply the reality of the kingdom, and this reality will consummate in the manifestation of the kingdom
In the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, the Lord Jesus sounded forth a call, not to the unbelievers but to the believers
Many are still short of the Lord's purpose and not up to the normal level which is adequate to bring in the manifestation of the kingdom
The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the ultimate consummation and fullest manifestation of the kingdom
We have participated in God's power and Christ's authority today, but our full enjoyment of them will be in the kingdom age
Exodus 23:19 says, 'The first of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring into the house of Jehovah your God'
The one hundred forty-four thousand, firstfruits to God and the Lamb, in Revelation 14 will be raptured to the throne of God
The firstfruits of His farm will not be brought into the 'barn' in the air, but to the temple which is on Mount Zion in the heavens
The firstfruits go not to the air, that is, to the barn, but directly to the Father's home in the third heaven
One hundred forty-four is twelve times twelve, which signifies the completion of completions, the ultimate completion in the fullest way
The height of its wall in 21:17 is one hundred forty-four cubits , and its dimensions in verse 16 are twelve thousand stadia
In eternity our number will be twelve, three multiplied by four, signifying the mingling of the Triune God with man
The New Jerusalem will declare to the whole universe that God's redeemed people will be twelve among twelve, completion among completions
When we are in the New Jerusalem, we will be the completion in God's administration for the fulfillment of God's economy for eternity
The one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruits are believers who are for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose
To be one of the firstfruits is to be for the completion of God's administration to fulfill His economy for eternity
They are living in the heavens today, and they will be standing with the Lamb in the heavens on Mount Zion in the future
There are some who are continually with the Lord, following Him all day and every day, and these receive a greater supply
We must permit the element of Christ, the divine constituent of Christ, to work in us continually to saturate and permeate our whole being
The 'one righteous act' is in particular ascribed to that single act of Christ in which He was obedient to God unto the death of the cross
It is not we who are obedient; it is Christ who is the obedient One living in us, Christ the Lamb by whom we live
Many Christians have never heard that Christ may be offered not only for propitiation but also as food for God's eating
On the one hand the manchild fulfills Gods purpose by defeating His enemy and on the other hand the firstfruits are for Gods satisfaction
The sisters desire to be with their husbands instead of going home to their parents because they love their husbands
We may have the liberty, and it may not be wrong to do them, but simply because of our love for the Lord Jesus, we would not do them
To the outsiders, it would come as a surprise if they saw us standing on Mount Zion, but it should not be a surprise to us
If we truly love the Lord and live in intimate fellowship with Him the rapture will not come as a surprise it will be an ordinary experience
If we follow Christ, we will not go to places of defiling worldly entertainment, because Jesus never goes there
If we separate ourselves to the Lord, we will grow every day, and we will be the firstfruits produced by the church life
If we simply come to the church meetings and follow the flow of the divine life, we will not remain the same but will grow in life
In a wheat field the grains which ripen first are those nearer the center of the field whereas the grains on the edges ripen last
He is making them mature to arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
In Ephesians 4 we see that we are growing up into the Head in all things and that all the Body causes the growth of the Body
According to the description in Revelation 14, the firstfruits are the saints who are saturated with the Lord Jesus
Our heart should ache for many of the Lord's children who seem to be ignorant, careless, and dull concerning the need to be matured
Christ is the seed, He is the growth, He is the transformation, and He is even the firstfruits and the harvest
Those who are the firstfruits spoken of in Revelation 14 will be among those who will be co-kings with Christ in the millennium
Christ will then come back with the overcomers and will reap the majority of the saints on earth as God's harvest
At the time of the harvest, Christ as the Son of Man comes down from the heavens to the air, descending on the cloud seen by others
Matthew 13 is the sowing of the seed, and Revelation 14 is the reaping of the harvest, the issue of the growth of the seed
Christ came as the Son of Man to sow the seed, and He will come again as the Son of Man to reap what He has sown
The golden crown on the Lord's head indicates that Jesus is the Lord and that the Lord is the One crowned with glory
All the believers since that time, who have received Him as the seed of life, have become God's crop on the earth
The first-ripe ones will be reaped as the firstfruits to God before the great tribulation, as indicated in Revelation 14:1-5
The suffering of the great tribulation will 'dry' the earthly waters from the remaining believers so that they may ripen
The reaping mentioned in Revelation 14:16 will take place after Antichrist forces people to worship him and his image
It refers to the rapture of the majority of the believers who are left on the earth to pass through the great tribulation
Because the rest of the harvest is green, it is left in the field until the earthly waters, the earthly supply, are dried up
In Matthew 13:39 the Lord Jesus indicated that the crop will be harvested at the completion of this age, which we have not yet reached
At the time of His coming, the Lord Jesus will send His angels to take the believers out of the field, the world
One day He will come back to rule over the earth and set up His kingdom with the overcoming believers as co-kings
These are the overcoming saints in the New Testament age who will be the heavenly army to join Christ in fighting Antichrist and his kings
To be called is to be saved, whereas to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord by virtue of an overcoming life
We have been called, but in order to be among the chosen in the future we need to live an overcoming life today
These are the followers of Christ, the ones who have been raptured, who fight the battle against Antichrist and his army at Armageddon
These overcomers are the bride of Christ, who will come down from the heavens with her Husband to fight against Antichrist
The burden of the ministry in the Lord's recovery is to present a feast full of the riches of Christ revealed in the New Testament
Although the riches of Christ are inexhaustible, it is wonderful that they are unveiled to us for our experience and enjoyment
Although most Christians are familiar with the former aspect of Christ, only a few pay attention to the latter aspect
The wife of the Lamb in Revelation 19 is the aggregate of all the overcoming saints from Abel until the Lord's return
The aggregate of all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers is the wife in Revelation 19:7 who will be ready for Christ's wedding
Christ will not marry each believer individually; instead, He will marry His corporate bride composed of His overcoming believers
Although this goes against our human concept, we should not focus on caring for the goodness or wickedness that comes out of us
Whether we are at home with our family or in the church meetings with the brothers and sisters, we all need to live out Christ
God's economy in the New Testament is that Christ would obtain the bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life
The subject of the New Testament is the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-working together to obtain the bride for the Son
In Acts and the Epistles we see how the Spirit works according to the Father's plan to obtain the bride for the Son
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, the goal of the Triune God will be attained at the end of this age
The Bridegroom, who will take the whole earth as His kingdom, certainly needs many sub-kings to be His co-kings
When we meet as the church today, we are joyful because we experience a foretaste of the wedding feast of Christ and the church
The more we allow Him to work Himself into us, the more we will have the element of God and the element of heaven in us
When we submit to the Holy Spirit, allowing God to work Himself into us, we have the presence of God and the taste of heaven within us
The bride having made herself ready means that the church has been completely built up and has grown to maturity
These three matters-God's building in us, our growth in the Lord's life, and our getting ready before the Lord-are all linked together
Those who make up the bride must not only be mature in life; they must also be built together as the one bride
He is sending out the call to overcome the degradation of Christianity so that a number of those who seek Him may be prepared as His bride
The bride, the wife, of Christ will be prepared in full by Him for His wedding as His pleasure and satisfaction
The preparation of the bride is by Christ's redemption, organic salvation, and the intensified work of His organic salvation
The coming of the marriage dinner of the Lamb in Revelation 197 refers to Christs marrying the New Jerusalem as His bride in the millennium
In the book of Revelation we are told that the wife has made herself ready and that the marriage of the Lamb has come
The fine linen, which is the righteousnesses of the saints, refers to Christ lived out of us in our daily life
The righteousness that is Christ Himself is sufficient for us to be justified and saved; this righteousness is singular in number
Rather, it is righteous deeds, the daily walk, the Christian living, which Christ as our life works out through us
According to the revelation of the whole Bible, we, the saved ones, need two garments-one for our salvation and one for our reward
We all have this first robe, which is Christ as our righteousness, our justification, that enables us to stand before the righteous God
According to the custom of the ancient Jews, no one could attend a wedding feast without a special wedding garment
If we would be qualified to attend the wedding feast of Christ, we need to live by Christ and live Him out in our daily living
Although we have the first garment, our second garment is now being prepared under the embroidering work of the Holy Spirit
The fact that the clothing of the bride is clean, or pure, means not only that it is without dirt but also that it is without mixture
The more this subjective righteousness is wrought into the church, the more she is prepared to become the bride
They also need to have the subjective righteousness interwoven into their being in order to have the fine linen, bright and clean
If we would have a share in this bride, we need to adorn ourselves with the bright, shining, and pure righteousness
Speaking of the New Jerusalem, Revelation 21:11 says, 'Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal'
The fact that jasper is the appearance of both God and the New Jerusalem indicates that this holy city will bear the same appearance as God
Today we are preparing our bridal gown, a gown that will have the appearance of righteousness, which is the expression of God
The bride of the Lamb and the guests invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb refer to the same group of persons
After being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity
To be invited to the wedding feast of Christ which will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium is to be blessed
To be invited to attend the wedding feast is to have the privilege of sharing the millennial kingdom as co-kings with Christ
Matthew 2214 says Many are called but few are chosen and Revelation 1714 says They who are with Him the called and chosen and faithful
Although we have the assurance that we have been called, we do not yet have the assurance that we will be chosen
Eventually, when Christ comes, the overcoming believers will join Him to feast at the marriage dinner of the Lamb
On the wedding day there is the bridegroom and the bride; on the following day there is the husband and the wife
The Lord's table is a weekly proclamation, a declaration to the whole universe, that we daily enjoy Christ as our food and drink
Even while we are fighting on the battlefield, the Lord spreads a table before us in the presence of our adversaries for us to feast on Him
Under the instigation of Antichrist, man will even wage war directly against the Lord of lords and the King of kings
Antichrist and the false prophet will be cast into the lake of fire , and Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss
At that time Christ will be happy, and we, His bride, will also be happy as we enjoy a wonderful honeymoon with our Bridegroom
In Matthew 25:41 the Lord Jesus said, 'Go away from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels'
Because the 'goats' followed the devil, they will be cast into the lake of fire prepared for him and his angels
Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies will be swept into the 'dust pan' and then dumped into the lake of fire
After the judgment at the great white throne, all the dead unbelievers will also be cast into the lake of fire
The Lord's fighting in the war at Armageddon will actually be a sweeping of the dirt into the universal trash can
In order for the Lord to enjoy a pleasant honeymoon and the thousand-year kingdom, all the trash must be swept away
Revelation 19:11 says, 'Behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war'
In righteousness Christ will return to make war against the unrighteousness practiced by Antichrist and all his partners
There will be the need for Christ to fight to subdue this rebellion and to judge these rebels in righteousness
We should be those who are laboring to help people to be saved in order to build up the Body of Christ for the kingdom of God
Most of us need to work to make a living, but all of us can separate a certain amount of time to the Lord for His interest
The unbelievers can always spare time for their amusement and entertainment, but we believers have God as our amusement and entertainment
Because we have experienced Him as light, life, manna, power, strength, holiness, and comfort, we know Him in all these aspects
Revelation 19:13 continues, 'He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called the Word of God'
That the Lord's name is called the Word of God means that He is the expression, the testimony, and the speaking of God
In Revelation 19, as the Word of God, Christ speaks for God by executing God's judgment upon the rebellious people
He will declare that God is the God over everyone and that He does not tolerate rebellion against His authority
It will tell Satan, Antichrist, the false prophet, and the entire universe that God is sovereign and that no one can rebel against Him
In the Gospel of John the Word of God does not speak of anything related to fighting rather He speaks of redemption light life and building
In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Word of God-King of kings and Lord of lords
According to Revelation 19, the church is both the bride who is presented to Christ and the warrior who fights with Him against God's enemy
In other words, it will be the bride of Christ who will follow Him as His army to fight and destroy Antichrist and his army
Just as in Ephesians 5 and 6 we see the church as the bride and as the warrior in Revelation 19 we also have these two aspects of the church
Spiritual warfare is not an individual matter; it is a matter of the Body, a corporate entity to fight the battle against God's enemy
The whole armor of God consists of the girdle, the breastplate, the shoes, the shield, the helmet, and the sword
According to verses 17 and 18, we receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit by means of all prayer and petition
In spiritual warfare we must deal not only with the objective enemy but even more with the subjective adversary
Because the enemy's elements are within us, we need the killing power of the word to be applied to our being subjectively
Whenever we are troubled by something negative within us, we should take the Word of God by means of prayer in spirit
If we would use the word of the Bible as a sword to kill the enemy, in our experience the word must be the Spirit
As brothers and sisters in the church, we all have our emotion, thought, opinion, and natural life, and we all have our own point of view
The evil power in the air comes in to take advantage of her emotion, and she determines not to forget that she has been offended
Apparently the sword of the Spirit kills our emotion; actually it kills the evil spirit in the air who takes advantage of our emotion
All the grapes, the Gentile military forces, will be gathered into the winepress and will be trodden by the Lord Jesus
All the Gentile evil worldly forces will be gathered there and the Lord with His overcoming saints will fight against and destroy them there
The sword, which proceeds out of the mouth of Christ, who is the Word of God, is the word that will judge the rebellious
When the Lord says, 'Antichrist, go to the lake of fire,' we will say Amen, and Antichrist will immediately be cast into the lake of fire
Christ will first smite the nations with His judging word; then with His strong power He will shepherd those who remain
Because the nations will still have the rebellious human nature, the Lord will shepherd them during the millennium with an iron rod
These four empires that devastate Israel are the Babylonian Empire the MedoPersian Empire the MacedonianGrecian Empire and the Roman Empire
The breast and the arms of silver signify Medo-Persia, and the abdomen and thighs of bronze signify Greece, including Macedonia
The legs of iron and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay signify the Roman Empire with its last ten kings
At the beginning of the great tribulation the form and appearance of the Roman Empire will be restored under Antichrist
According to the books of Daniel and Revelation, the last Caesar of the Roman Empire will be Antichrist, who will be supported by ten kings
Human government not only rebels against God, exalts man, and worships idols but also fights against God directly
On the day of His wedding, Christ will marry the one who has been fighting the battle against God's enemy for years
Revelation 19:16 goes on to say, 'He has on His garment and on His thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS'
In His ascension, Jesus as a man was inaugurated into the new position of King of kings and Lord of lords to be the Head over all things
The more people oppose Him the more transcendent He is and the more people believe in Him the more people oppress Him the more He multiplies
Hitler, who was the worst persecutor of God's people in modern times, had a very pitiful end, dying without a proper place for burial
The war mentioned in Revelation 19:19 is an actual physical war, not a spiritual one; it is a war between God and man
Antichrist and the false prophet will be the first group to go into the lake of fire, the universal 'trash can'
Revelation 19:21 continues, 'The rest were killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse'
As the result of the war at Armageddon, Christ will defeat Antichrist, who, with the false prophet, will be cast alive into the lake of fire
Between the rapture of the overcomers and the beginning of the millennial kingdom, many things will take place
The kingdom will not come at that time, for the three and a half years of the great tribulation are yet to come
Revelation 20:1-3 says, 'I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand
Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss, which is in the heart of the earth, and he will be imprisoned there for a thousand years
After the war at Armageddon, the Lord will establish His throne of glory in Jerusalem and gather before Him all the nations still on earth
The 'goats' will go to the fire prepared for the devil and his angels, and the 'sheep' will enter into the millennial kingdom as citizens
They will still have a rebellious nature within them; thus, they will need a further test a thousand years later
Because the Lord will use Satan to test them, He will not cast Satan into the lake of fire at the beginning of the millennium
Acts 3:21 refers to 'the times of the restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from of old'
Today the sun and the moon are not normal, because they have been cursed through the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man
As Genesis 3:17 and 18 further indicate, the whole earth has been cursed because of man's fall and is also not in a normal state
At the time of the restoration, not only mankind but also all of creation will be restored to its original condition
Isaiah 11:8 says, 'The nursing child will play by the cobra's hole, / And upon the viper's den / The weaned child will stretch his hand'
Isaiah 35:1 and 2 say, 'The wilderness and the desert will be glad; / And the desert will exult and blossom / Like the rose
According to the prophecies of the Bible the millennial kingdom is in two sections the upper heavenly section and the lower earthly section
The upper section of the millennium is called the kingdom of the Father , and the lower section is called the kingdom of the Son of Man
The second group, found in the lower section, is the preserved and proper Jews, who will be saved at the time of the Lord's coming back
According to Zechariah 12:10-14, these Jews will look on Him whom they have pierced, and then they will repent
These saved Jews will enter into the millennium as priests and will teach the nations to seek God and to know Him
Isaiah 61:6 says, 'You will be called the priests of Jehovah; / People will speak of you as the ministers of our God'
The kingly overcomers will be in the upper part of the millennium, and the priestly Jews and the citizens will be in the lower part
Undoubtedly, Peter, Paul, James, Stephen, and the many others slain throughout the centuries will be included in this group
These saints, martyred for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, will be resurrected to be co-kings of Christ
After the rapture of the overcomers, many saints will be martyred because they refuse to worship Antichrist or receive his mark
If those in the man-child will be among the co-kings, then certainly those making up the firstfruits will be also
If the Lord Jesus came today and put us on thrones as kings, we ourselves might tell Him that we are not qualified
After being saved, they passed through certain kinds of experiences which made them adequate and prepared to be kings
The first resurrection is also the 'ex-resurrection,' that is, the extraordinary resurrection for which the apostle Paul sought
It is the resurrection set apart from the common resurrection, the resurrection with honor, comparable to graduation with honors
Many hold an erroneous view that only believers will be resurrected and that unbelievers will not be resurrected
Concerning those who participate in the first resurrection, verse 6 continues, 'Over these the second death has no authority'
We should not believe, as many Christians do, that after our resurrection everything will necessarily be all right
If there is no possibility that we might still have a problem, why then will we be judged after the resurrection?
In 1 Corinthians 3:15 Paul says, 'If anyone's work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire'
Romans 14:12 says that, as we stand before this judgment seat, 'each one of us will give an account concerning himself to God'
Although we may criticize others today, as we stand before the judgment seat, we will have to criticize ourselves
That punishment will be something related to the second death just as weakness sickness trouble and hardship are related to the first death
Today God uses weakness, sickness, trouble, and hardship to discipline us and to chastise us so that we may grow in life
If you leave school before you graduate and return some time later, you will still have to complete your schoolwork
If we die in our immaturity, after our resurrection we will stand in immaturity before the Lord's judgment seat
Only the overcomers, those who participate in the best resurrection, will not be subject to anything of the second death
Although we are saved for eternity, we still need to grow, mature, and be perfected so that we may be among the co-kings of Christ
Verse 6 also says that the overcomers 'will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years'
The overcomers will be priests to contact God and co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations in the millennium
Today the proper Christians bring man and man's need to God and Christ, and they also minister God and Christ to man
The overcomers will be priests to contact God and co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations in the millennium
In Revelation 21:2-22:5 Christ is revealed as the universal and eternal Husband of the New Jerusalem, the universal and eternal wife
The New Jerusalem is the God-men who have been transformed, glorified, and mingled with the processed and consummated Triune God
The New Jerusalem is a composition of divinity and humanity mingled, blended, and built up together as one entity
The subject of the Bible is a divine romance of a universal couple the male is God Himself and the female is Gods chosen and redeemed people
In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, God likens His chosen people to a spouse and a dwelling place for Himself
The holy city is a corporate person and this corporate person is a couplethe processed Triune God married to the transformed tripartite man
Revelation 22:17 indicates that Christ and the New Jerusalem as His wife will be a universal couple for eternity
Revelation 21:2 says, 'I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband'
The New Jerusalem is adorned with pure gold, pearl, and precious stones, that is, with the Triune God as the elements
The plaits of gold are fastened with studs of silver, signifying Christ the Son in His all-inclusive judicial redemption
The strings of jewels on the seeker's neck signify God the Spirit in His transforming work to become her obedience to God's will
Eventually, what is built at the end of the Bible will be a city of gold, precious stones, and pearls to replace silver
The entire Bible speaks the same thing concerning Gods economy to produce the church as the Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem
Christ will be the Husband, and the holy city, Jerusalem-the aggregate of all the saints-will be the bride, the wife of the Lamb
The holy city is a constitution in life of the processed Triune God mingled with His regenerated transformed and glorified tripartite elect
The New Jerusalem is a city that is absolutely saturated and mingled with God; therefore, it is absolutely holy
In anything we do, if we have some experience of God in Christ being mingled with us, we experience holiness in that thing
Holiness is not a matter of action but a matter of nature; it is not a matter of what we do but of how much we have been mingled with God
There is no saturation of God in the Old Testament, and the holiness, or sanctification, there is only positional, not dispositional
In the Old Testament a piece of gold could be made holy and sanctified by changing its position, by placing it in the temple
The New Jerusalem is holy not merely in the sense of the Old Testament but also in the sense of the New Testament
In the New Testament, however, the church is God's temple , and this temple is not only separated unto God but also saturated with God
The New Jerusalem is called the holy city because gold, which signifies God's holy nature, is the site of the New Jerusalem
Since all the believers will be the components of the holy city, all of them should be sanctified to be as holy as the holy city
In the Old Testament we see that God's people were considered material to be built together as His dwelling place
In the garden in Genesis 2 there is the tree of life, and near the tree of life there is a river flowing in four directions
The first mention of stone in the Bible is not of ordinary, common stone but of onyx, a type of precious stone
According to the record of Genesis 28 Jacob a supplanter had a divine dream in which he saw a ladder set up on earth and reaching to heaven
He took the stone he had used for a pillow, set it up as a pillar, anointed it with oil, and called it Bethel, meaning the house of God
The precious stones of both the breastplate and the shoulder pieces bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel
John 1 tells us that when Peter first met the Lord Jesus, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone
The concept that the believers are stones to be built up for God's habitation is not new in the book of Revelation
The entire city of New Jerusalem is God's building, the living composition of all God's redeemed, regenerated, and transformed saints
The bride in the kingdom age will include the overcomers , but the wife in eternity will include all God's redeemed ones
In this passage Jerusalem does not denote a physical city but the people represented by the city a living people who were a wife to Jehovah
In Song of Songs the seeker passes through a process to become the Shulammite, the duplication of Solomon and a figure of the New Jerusalem
The lover of Solomon, having passed through various stages of transformation, has become Solomon's duplication
The New Jerusalem is a mingling of divinity and humanity to express the processed and consummated Triune God in human virtues
Christ and His wife will be joined together to be the New Jerusalem for God's expression; this is the consummated Shulammite
The many lovers of Christ eventually will become duplications of God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead
Surely our God is able to make us the same as He is in His life in His nature in His expression and in His function to carry out His economy
We are involved in this divine romance, and we are participating in this wonderful conclusion of the entire Holy Scriptures
John 3 reveals that all the regenerated believers constitute the bride of their Redeemer as His increase, His enlargement
The increase in John 3:30, however, is the bride in verse 29, who is a living composition of all the regenerated people
John had to be put into prison; otherwise, there would have been two bridegrooms-Jesus Christ and John the Baptist
Since John the Baptist had carried out his ministry to introduce Jesus Christ, it was necessary that he must decrease
There is one church with many members, and Paul betrothed the believers in a corporate way as one corporate virgin to one Husband-Christ
The New Jerusalem as the wife of the Lamb is also the consummation of the church as the wife in Ephesians 5:25-27 and 29-32
The church in Ephesians 5 is the wife in the stage of development, and the New Jerusalem will be the consummated bride
The church in Ephesians 5 still has wrinkles and spots, but the bride in Revelation 21 has no wrinkles or spots
According to Revelation 121 this woman is clothed with the sun and the moon underneath her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars
To the Lord a thousand years are as one day ; hence, the millennium will be the wedding day of the Lamb with the church as His bride
Revelation 21:14 says, 'The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb'
Christ's twelve apostles will be the twelve foundations of the wall of the holy city, the universal wife of Christ
Whenever the New Testament speaks of the apostles, the church is implied, for the apostles represent the church
Verse 14 says that the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb
The Old Testament is a history of the twelve tribes, and the New Testament is a history of the twelve apostles
Also, if we would understand the significance of the twelve apostles, we need to understand the entire New Testament
God would not let any of His things be mixed up with the things which are not of Him, so there is the need of separation
The wall of the holy city protects the interest of the riches of God's divinity and the attainments of Christ's consummation
God's appearance is like jasper, and the light of the New Jerusalem is like jasper; hence, the whole city will express God
God the Father is the gold as the base, God the Son is the gates to bring people in, and God the Spirit transforms people to express God
The twelve apostles here represent the grace of the New Testament, signifying that the New Jerusalem is built upon the grace of God
The gates of the New Jerusalem are the initial section of the building, and the wall is the consummated section
The twelve foundations of the wall, built with every precious stone , bear the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb
Whether in our personal life or in the services of the church, the wall, the boundary, cannot be according to our discernment or view
The foundations of the New Jerusalem are not the foundation mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3:10-11, which is Christ
Since in eternity there will be no further need for the prophets, the foundations of the holy city will consist only of the apostles
The apostles signify that the New Jerusalem, which is the building of God and the testimony of Jesus, is not of man but of God
If there is any human element, sooner or later that will be a weak point and will be heavily attacked by the enemy
If God loves us and gives us a gift when we are in a pitiful state and unworthy of love, this is an act of mercy
When we study the four Gospels, we see that although Peter was poor and pitiful, he was nevertheless chosen and used by the Lord
If we are humble, we will realize how truly pitiful we are before the Lord and how worthless we are in His eyes
In those days the Jews scorned tax gatherers, men who collected taxes for Caesar and the Roman Empire, not for the temple of God
Because the foundation of the city is built upon the faithfulness with which God keeps His covenant, it is trustworthy and reliable
The New Jerusalem standing upon the twelve layers of its foundations in the colors of the rainbow guarantees God's faithfulness
The layer upon layer of precious stones, which compose the foundation of the city, show forth the colors of the rainbow
These twelve layers of precious stones as the foundation appear as a rainbow, eternally declaring God's faithfulness
All the apostles were created as clay, but they were regenerated and were transformed into precious stones for God's eternal building
The New Jerusalem is built of three kinds of precious materials, signifying that she is built with the Triune God
We all appreciate Peter, John, and the other disciples, but we may not realize how much pressure they experienced
On the day of Pentecost Peter and John were no longer clay; rather, they had become stones, so strong and precious
All the members of Christ's Body must be transformed in order that God may have the foundation and the wall of the holy city
The first layer of the wall's foundation, as well as the entire wall of the New Jerusalem, is built with jasper
Since jasper signifies God expressed in His communicable glory, the main function of the holy city is to express God in bearing His glory
Today's Christian workers not only have different colors, but instead of being one on top of another, they are side by side
The work of the apostles, on the contrary, was layer upon layer and led to the unique appearance of jasper, the appearance of God in Christ
Unlike Peter Paul and John many of todays Christian workers build up their own houses each with its own design shape color and expression
In the entire universe there will only be the unique New Jerusalem built upon the foundation of many ministries laid one on top of the other
Although there will be different ministries, they will be layer upon layer, and they will lead to the one appearance of God in Christ
All the ministries must lead to one appearance-the appearance of today's church and of the coming New Jerusalem
We are not building side by side; we are building one on top of another to bring forth the unique testimony of God in the universe
The city is the aggregate of all the saints, and in the city Christ with the Lord God the Almighty will be the temple
In other words, the redeemed saints will be the city, and the redeeming Triune God will be the temple in this city
The designation the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb signifies the many attributes and accomplishments of the Triune God
The temple in Revelation 21:22 is built with the Triune God, with all His attributes plus all His accomplishments
All that He has obtained and attained are the materials for the building up of this wonderful temple that we have today
We are in such a temple built with the Lord, with God, with the Almighty, with the Lamb, and with all His attributes and accomplishments
We must believe that these living persons, built together as God's dwelling place, will be enlarged and intensified
John's particular use of the word tabernacled indicates that when the Lord Jesus was on earth in the flesh, He was God's tabernacle
Colossians 2:9 tells us that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily, in Christ with a human, physical body
In the Old Testament the temple was in the city of Jerusalem, but in Revelation 21 and 22 the entire city is the tabernacle and the temple
We must believe that our abiding in the Lord and His abiding in us will be intensified, enlarged, and uplifted to the uttermost
In the Old Testament the tabernacle was God's dwelling, and at the same time it was also the priests' dwelling in which they served
We have already seen in 21:22 that John saw no temple in the New Jerusalem because its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb
He dwells in us, and we dwell in Him, and this mutual dwelling is the New Jerusalem, which to God is the tabernacle and to us is the temple
John 14:23 says that the Father and the Son will come to the one who loves the Son and make an abode, a dwelling place, with him
In eternity future the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle for God's dwelling and the temple for our dwelling
Concerning God and His redeemed in the New Jerusalem, a new hymn says, 'As man yet God they coinhere, / A mutual dwelling place to be'
We can testify strongly that many times we know that we are truly in the Lord and that He is actually abiding in us
All the members of the same divine family live in that temple where they worship God and live as kings, making that living place a palace
We believers in Christ who are washed by the blood and regenerated by the Spirit are the children of God who will eventually become kings
Our Father-King is the unique Father, but He will have millions of co-rulers, or co-regents, because we will all be His co-kings
The entire Bible tells us that we, the children of God, eventually will be the children-kings in the King's house
The reign in the holy city will be not only God Himself as the Father-King but also His children as the co-kings with their Father
The principle revealed in the Bible is that a building with three equal dimensions indicates the Holy of Holies
Because the whole city is the Holy of Holies and because the inner temple is God and the Lamb, the city itself is God and the Lamb
The entire city of New Jerusalem is not only God Himself but also a living composition of all God's redeemed ones
On the one hand, the church is a composition of all the believers; on the other hand, Christ is both the Head and the Body
While Moses was traveling in the wilderness with the children of Israel for forty years, in his deep feeling he was dwelling in God
When we enter into eternity, we will dwell, serve, worship, and pray in the processed Triune God as the Spirit reaching us
Today we do not have a physical temple, for our temple is our triune, processed, redeeming God reaching us as the Spirit
The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the entire divine revelation, and this is a practical application of God being our temple
In the church meetings we need to have the realization that we are actually meeting in the triune, processed, redeeming, and reaching God
In Revelation, however, John tells us that the temple in which we worship is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb
We may ask, then, since God and Christ are the temple, are They the Dwellers within the city or are They the dwelling place?
We see the Lamb as the One who holds God within Him as light because the Lamb is the lamp, and God is the light in the lamp
Without Him as the redeeming One, we can never come to touch, to contact, God as light since we are so sinful and in darkness
Whenever we contact God as light, we have the sense that we need redemption, the redeeming blood of the Lord and the Lord as the Lamb
Just as the light is in the lamp and is one body with the lamp, so God is in Christ and is one body with Christ
We may liken the lamp to a big bulb which is able to enlighten a city whose breadth, length, and height are vast
God the Father as the light needs a lamp; without an adequate lamp or bulb, an electrical light will not shine in an enlightening way
The Son, being the Lamb in His person, is the lamp to express all that the Father is as the light and as the source of the divine riches
We may say that a light bulb is the embodiment of the electrical light, that is, the embodiment of the electrical 'riches'
Because we are under the shining of the Son as the embodiment of all the divine riches, we can enjoy these riches
Since the day we were saved, we began to enjoy God as the divine light in the redeeming Christ illumining us all the time
The light of the holy city is the unique, eternal, divine light in which the redeemed elect live and move within the city
Revelation tells us that in the New Jerusalem we do not need the natural light of the moon and the sun or any artificial light
In the same way, the holy city in eternity future will have no need of the sun or of the moon because God Himself will be the light
As we have seen, the measurements of the city in three dimensions also prove that the city is the Holy of Holies
The glory of God as the light and the Lamb as the lamp signify that God in Christ is the light of the New Jerusalem in eternity
We do not need philosophy, the human-made light, and we do not need ethical teachings, such as those of Confucius
He talks about the relationship between wife and husband, between children and parents, and between slaves and masters
We should not realize or do anything according to our natural ability or according to the education we have received
Todays Christians are divided by many kinds of natural and artificial light but we must be controlled by the unique genuine highest light
Many of the saints exercise their natural ability too much, even in the church life, and for this reason there are murmurings and reasonings
For the building up of the Body of Christ, we need to walk and live under the divine, redeeming, and shining light through the word of God
The Lamb as the lamp shines with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light
If all the lights in a major city were to go out, the whole city would be in darkness, and there would be robbery, looting, and killing
The illuminating glory of God is the light within Christ, and the redeeming Christ is the lamp containing the light
God's glory is the light of the city, and God is contained by Christ as the content, shining out through Christ
God punished the Egyptians with a thick darkness for three days , and in the future God will punish Antichrist and his kingdom with darkness
He will be not only the nature of the New Jerusalem but also the shining light as an enjoyment to the entire city
When we open our entire being to Him, however, we are in the light, and the light is God Himself enjoyed by us in our daily life
For the believers, there will be no night because in the holy city God Himself will be the 'sun' that will never go down
Revelation 22:3 goes on to say of the holy city, New Jerusalem, that 'the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it'
The one throne of God and of the Lamb signifies that God and the Lamb are one-the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer
According to Revelation 4:3, God, the One on the throne, 'was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance'
The New Jerusalem also has a center, which is the throne of God and of the Lamb , the throne of our redeeming God
Since there will be the throne of God and of the Lamb in the New Jerusalem, God's ruling will be among the saints
In the first section of Revelation the throne of God is the center, and in the second section the temple of God is the center
The center of the New Jerusalem is the throne of God and of the Lamb, with God's sovereign power, God's authority
Our God is not only the God on the throne for His administration nor only the God in the temple for His expression
In eternity future God's throne will be in the center of the New Jerusalem, and His expression will extend to the circumference
Baptism is the real entrance into the Triune God , and the entrance into the Triune God is the initial entrance into the New Jerusalem
Immediately after we pass through the pearl gates, we find ourselves on the golden street that leads us upward to the throne of God
God has a nature, and His nature is of many attributes, which include love, light, holiness, righteousness, and kindness
If we are saved only according to God's grace or according to God's love, our salvation is not legally justified-it is not judicial
In the New Jerusalem both the street and the base are gold, signifying God's nature in the attribute of righteousness
God is the One who had a purpose, made a plan in eternity past, and created all things for the fulfillment of His plan
The throne of God and of the Lamb denotes that this throne is to carry out God's plan through Christ's redemption
The throne is the source from which the river of water of life flows, and it flows with the tree of life growing in it
In the meeting we may say the throne is in us, but many times in our daily living, the throne is often neglected by us
As we have seen, Revelation 22 shows that the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb
Because the Lord desires to set up His throne within us, He cares for the authority, the ground, and the dominion within us
The church is the place where God exercises His authority, and the throne of God's Son is set up among the churches
Every day we need to realize that we are persons who are under the divine throne and who are also in the divine administration
If we can remember that we are persons under the divine throne and in the divine administration, this will change our daily life
It is by His administration that God dispenses Himself into us as life as the life supply and as the eternal absolute allinclusive grace
The divine authority in the church is for God to dispense Himself into us as life, as the life supply, and as the all-sufficient grace
Within this river grows the tree of life, revealing that the rich Christ with the living Spirit flows out of the throne of grace
To the unbelievers and to the demons, the throne of God and of the Lamb is a throne merely of authority; to us, it is the throne of grace
Many of us can testify that whenever we fail to enthrone the Lord, we do not receive grace in our times of prayer
In Hebrews 4 the throne is the throne of grace, but in Revelation 4 the throne is mainly the throne of authority
Proceeding out of the throne is not authority but the river of water of life with the tree of life as the life supply
Although the throne is the throne of authority, the throne of headship, out of the throne flows the river of water of life
He is reigning in the church, among the churches, and over all the churches through the flowing of His life as grace
We have experienced that when we subject ourselves to this headship, we immediately sense something full of God's riches flowing within us
God flows in the water of life, the Lamb flows in the water of life, and the Spirit flows as the water of life
Without the throne, the New Jerusalem does not have a center, and without the throne, there is no flow of life
Many Christians are dried up, starved to death, and without growth in life because the throne is neglected in their experience
Today we are experiencing the throne of God and of the Lamb out of which flows the Triune God for our enjoyment
We are living and existing for the accomplishment of God's purpose in order to carry out what Christ has accomplished
We experience the One on the throne in His headship and lordship, and we submit ourselves to such an authority
In our daily life, in our family life, in our married life, in our business life, and in our church life, the center must be God's throne
In our Christian experience the unique item should be the throne of the One who purposed and of the One who redeemed
The water of life will be proceeding out of the throne to supply us and to bring to us the tree of life which nourishes us all day long
We need to realize that what is recorded in Revelation 21 and 22 should be experienced by us today in a very personal way
Out of the throne of God and of the Lamb flows the river of water of life, and in this river the tree of life grows as a spreading vine
The tree of life, the life-supplying Christ, is a great vine growing on the two sides of the river to nourish the entire city for its food
God's throne is for His government, the river is for our watering, and the tree of life is for our nourishment
In brief, the tree of life in the Bible is a figure of the Triune God embodied in Christ to be the substance of the divine life
Out of the enjoyment of the Lord as our life supply, we will have our daily life, our walk, our work, and the building up of the churches
In the first two chapters of the Bible we see the old heaven, the old earth, the old garden, Adam, and the tree of life
In the last two chapters of the Bible we see the new heaven, the new earth, and the city with the tree of life
The heaven and earth have changed, the garden has been changed into the city, and the first man has been changed into the corporate new man
In the Bible the tree of life is mentioned first in Genesis 2, and it proceeds to the end of the Bible in Revelation 22
The life in 1010 He declared I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly and in John 151 He said I am the true vine
The tree of life was closed to man due to his fall , but it has been opened to believers by the redemption of Christ
Eventually in the new heaven and new earth for eternity all of Gods redeemed will enjoy Christ the tree of life as their eternal portion
If the tree of life were tall like a pine tree and its fruit were at the top, its fruit would be too high for us to reach without difficulty
The tree of life is spreading and proceeding along the flow of the water of life for God's people to receive and enjoy
The water of life quenches our thirst from within by our drinking, and the tree of life nourishes us from within by our eating
For eternity we will be organically united with God every day and every minute by our eating and drinking of Him
God's river of water of life is available along this divine way, and we enjoy the river by walking in this way of life
The street is the two banks of the river on which the tree of life grows, and the street signifies the divine nature as our holy way
When we take the divine way, the street of God's nature, we will have the life flowing in us and the life supply nourishing us
Day by day as we are living such a life and walking according to Gods nature we enjoy the water of life and the tree of life as our supply
As soon as we submit to this headship, the life-giving Spirit immediately flows within us, and we find ourselves on the golden street
As we walk along the golden street we find that the inward flowing of the lifegiving Spirit is marvelous refreshing satisfying and supplying
Along this flow of the living water there are the riches of the tree of life that grows by the flow of the river
The street begins from the mountaintop, which represents God Himself, to reach all the twelve gates of the city
As we have seen, in the midst of this street is the river of water of life to flow out the riches of God to be our supply
The river of life flows out of the throne and spirals down the mountain, eventually reaching all twelve gates on each of the four sides
Every part of the city receives the life supply, because the tree of life grows in the river, and the river reaches every part of the city
In the entire Bible the books that speak most clearly concerning God's flowing out as life are Ezekiel and Revelation
Our experience should not be like the children of Israel who ate the same food, the manna, every day for forty years
God redeemed us to enjoy the tree of life, and this enjoyment is for God's administration in His eternal economy
The mention of 'each month' indicates that in the new heaven and new earth the moon will still be there to divide the twelve months
As for time, in the new heaven and new earth, there are twelve months yearly, twelve hours daily, and twelve hours nightly
The water of life quenches our thirst, and the tree of life nourishes us, feeds us, and satisfies us organically
For eternity, we are destined to eat Christ as the tree of life, which is the fullest expression of Jesus Christ
The fruit is for the propagation and multiplication of the vine; second, it is for food to provide nourishment to the eaters
When a local church is full of the fruits of life, producing new fruit every month, the abundance of life will be fully manifested
The promise is found in Revelation 22:14, which says, 'Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life'
The whole Bible ends with eating and drinking, with enjoying God as the tree of life and drinking Him as the water of life
When we enjoy Christ as the tree of life, the unbelievers are regulated by our conduct, which we live out of Christ
According to Matthew 143435 after Jesus and the disciples came to Gennesaret the people of that place brought to the Lord all who were ill
According to Numbers 15, the fringe of the garment signifies the virtue of God's people who walk according to His regulations
When Jesus was on earth as a man, He walked in this way; His daily walk was regulated by God's heavenly commandments
In the church life we experience the Lord's presence with us on the 'sea' in the midst of the 'contrary winds'
When we have the proper church life with the Lord's presence today, there is among us the uplifted humanity of Jesus
If we, the church people, have the proper church life and live by Christ, we will live out His uplifted humanity
If the church people live out the uplifted humanity of Christ, this will cause healing power to flow into them
The peoples of God are not regenerated but restored to their created condition that was lost due to the fall of Adam
Through Christ's redemption, the heaven, the earth, and all created things were reconciled, redeemed back to God
Christ's redemption is not only for us, the regenerated people, but also for all the things in the heavens and the earth
They will be judged based upon how they have treated the Lord's brothers during the three and a half years of the great tribulation
The sheep are those who have helped the Lord's brothers-the Jews and the Christians-during the great tribulation
One function is to produce the fruit to feed the believers, and the other function is to produce leaves for the healing of the nations
Governmentally, He continues His universal operation which He originated from eternity and will bring to completion
He will be the Omega, the ending for the completion of His eternal purpose; He will finalize and finish what He has initiated
In 1 Corinthians 1:8 Paul says that God will confirm us 'until the end unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ'
After receiving grace as our base, we need to grow in grace so that we will be unreprovable in the day of Christ's coming
When the Bible says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation , it implies that Christ includes every item of the creation
The letters inscribed on the twelve stones in the breastplate typify Christ as the letters in the heavenly alphabet
If He is our alphabet, He will automatically become every word, sentence, paragraph, and chapter, and ultimately the whole book
The Triune God Himself is the alphabet used in writing this poem; He is the letters used to make up the words that compose this poem
Anyone who lives Christ for the church knows Christ as alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and every other letter of the heavenly alphabet
We should learn to compose something with the Triune God as letters, and we should become accustomed to using these heavenly letters
We need to learn to write with these letters, realizing that the New Testament actually is composed of God Himself
All that is unveiled in Revelation 21 and 22 will eventually come to pass, because Christ is the Alpha and the Omega
We should not excuse ourselves, thinking that the visions in this book are too high for us and that we cannot attain them
In the first book of the New Testament, He spoke about the building of the church , and what He has begun, He will accomplish
He is the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End of God's operation, and the content and continuation of whatever God is doing
No matter how great the sufferings through which He passed were, those sufferings could not terminate or damage Him
When the Lord told the church in Smyrna that He is the First and the Last, He was also indicating that the church had to be victorious
With the divine things there is no beginning and no ending because whatever is divine is eternal, having no beginning and no ending
John had an intention to show us that whatever he ministered to us is eternal, with no beginning and no ending
We must exercise our faith in this all-inclusive One, the One who is the Alpha, the Omega, the First, the Last, the Beginning, and the End
In His divinity, Christ is the Root, the source, of David; in His humanity, Christ is the Offspring, the issue, of David
The Bible clearly reveals to us that our Lord is God as well as man, the true God and the true man, the perfect God and the perfect man
He is God who knows everything and sees everything , who is omnipresent, and who descended out of heaven yet is still in heaven
At His coming back, Christ will be the rising sun to His people generally but the morning star to His watching lovers particularly
It is also like a girl waiting to be married, who knows of the wedding day and who is waiting wholeheartedly for that day to arrive
He reminded Timothy that by the Lord's judgment and kingdom we should have a living that loves the Lord's appearing
We should not think that because the Lord has been tolerating the situation for more than nineteen centuries, He is slow to come back
Because the bride is not yet ready, we may say that it is possible that the Lord's coming will not be as soon as some expect
The bride must be prepared for the Bridegroom, and this preparation is through the growth in life, a growth that requires time
The Roman Catholic Church controlled people by its organization but those who broke away from Catholicism brought in division after division
By being restricted in this fellowship, the Body of Christ is kept in oneness, and the work of the ministry continues to advance
At the Lord's coming, this reward will be rendered to each one of the believers after their rapture at the judgment seat of Christ
Some will receive His punishment because the Lord's word 'My reward is with Me' implies that there is not only reward but also punishment
We will stand before the judgment seat and give the Lord an account concerning all of our past living, walk, and conduct
It is because of this that even the apostle Paul says that he dared not examine himself, but He who examined him was the Lord
As we live on earth, it is not sufficient for us to merely have a conscience without offense; the Lord must still judge the way we serve Him
We cannot say that we are not saved, that we do not have the Lord's life, or that we do not have the Holy Spirit
In the same way, when we use the life, the Holy Spirit, and the talent we have received from the Lord, there will be a full result
If we have built with wood, grass, and stubble, our work will immediately be consumed when it passes through the fire
The matter of salvation has already been resolved, but the matter of reward is an issue that has not yet been resolved
There, the decision will be made regarding what reward they will receive-the enjoyment in the coming kingdom or some punishment
Many Bible readers know and can recite the first sentence of the Bible: 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'
We can see three layers: God is the light, Christ is the lamp, and the church-the New Jerusalem-is the lamp container
Revelation 21 and 22 reveal that God will not be alone for eternity but will be in Christ within the holy city
God's purpose is altogether a matter of our being built together as a corporate entity to become the holy city
God as light shines from within the Lamb as the lamp through the city as the light-bearer to express Himself as the glory
The glory of God as the light is in the redeeming Lamb as the lamp shining through the New Jerusalem as the light's diffuser
God as the divine light shines within and through the redeeming Christ, and this shining enlightens the entire city
When God shines in the city, He is expressed in glory, first in and through Christ, and then in the city and through the saints
Today the believers as children of light are the light of the world , shining in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation
It does not have light in itself, but the light, which is God, has been wrought into it and shines out through it
God shines in Christ through the city, since the whole city will be transparent because everyone in it will have been transformed
There is no more clay, nothing opaque; every bit of clay has been transformed into crystal-clear precious stones
Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another degree of glory
A certain saint may be a very good person, but he may still be opaque because he remains very much in the old creation
When we are with another saint, we may sense that with him everything is transparent because he has experienced much transformation in life
The entire city of the New Jerusalem is the diffuser, diffusing the divine light over the nations outside the city
All the nations around the city will be under this diffusing with God as the light of glory and Christ as the containing lamp
Eventually, we will be glorified with Christ to bear the glory of God for God's expression in the New Jerusalem
The light is God, its glory is the expression of God, and its appearance is God Himself revealed to the nations
God Himself in the church is our dwelling place, and He is also the light that shines out through us to our neighbors
The entire eternal kingdom of God will be under the shining of God's glory in the Redeemer through the redeemed as the diffuser
The redeemed who constitute the New Jerusalem are the kings to reign, and the nations around the New Jerusalem are the subjects
In the millennium the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be intensified sevenfold
The nations will not need to walk in the sunlight or in the moonlight, for they will walk in the shining of the New Jerusalem
The church should be such a shining light today, and all our neighbors should walk in the light of our shining
At that time the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah , and all things will be headed up in Christ
Because God is the source of life, He recovers the oneness of the universe by entering into man to be man's life
From Him flows the river of life with the tree of life to supply all His sons, and the redeemed ones as the sons of God are filled with life
The whole city shines out this life as light, and the nations, representing the whole universe, walk in the light of this city
At that time the entire universe will be in harmony, and there will be no more death and, thus, no more darkness and no more confusion
All the surrounding nations, representing the entire universe, walk in this light and are controlled under this light
When we are filled with Christ under His headship, light shines out of us, and others are under the enlightening of this light
In Revelation 21 we see the Head, the Body surrounding the Head, and all the nations walking in the light of the city
As those in the miniature, we are enjoying the dispensing of life with light, and we are being headed up in Christ
Even though God's life is in us, if the light of life cannot be diffused out from us, we can never arrive at the oneness
When the life of the Head passes through the church, His Body, and reaches all things, all things become headed up in Christ
Romans 8 shows that the church has not yet arrived at the oneness, because the sons of God have not yet entered into glory
When the New Jerusalem is expressed, the life within her will shine forth, and the nations will walk by her light
God's life operates in the church and shines forth from the church to be light to the nations; this is how He heads up all things
The New Jerusalem is composed of many members, represented by the twelve tribes and the twelve apostles , but they all are one
God will shine on all creation through this universal lampstand and by this shining this enlightening God will bring all things into order
After the end of the coming millennial kingdom, the ancient serpent and death will be cast into the lake of fire
All the nations will be brought into this shining, and they will walk in this light and be controlled by this light
Creation will be completely released from the slavery of corruption and will be brought into the freedom of the glory of the holy city
God must first work in the church until the church is full of life inwardly and is entirely subject to the Head
In Revelation 21 we see that God placed the city in the center of the new universe so that the nations might walk by its light
The light of life from within him will dispel the darkness in his home, and the power of life within him will swallow up any death
Every one of us in the church is responsible for allowing the Lord to work and shine in us and to be diffused through us
