   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Camping at Bethel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 28:10-11 says, "And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He camped in the wilderness with stones for his pillows.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His life of discipline had begun.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 12-14 say, "And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These were the words we read in Genesis 12.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God now gave Jacob the promises He gave to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When did God give these promises to Jacob?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He gave them while he was still supplanting and before his fleshly and natural life was dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God was able to say these words to him because He was confident.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He knew that Jacob could not run away from His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One day God would finish His work of making him a vessel for His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our God is a confident God; He can reach His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a man were doing this, he surely would have worried.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jacob was such an unreliable person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What would happen if he became involved in some kind of trouble?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But God had absolute assurance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was able to say, "In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God had decided.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our hope lies in God's trustworthiness, not in our trustworthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our usefulness depends on God's will, not on the strength of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to know Him as the God who never fails.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At Bethel Jacob heard God speaking to him in a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God did not rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not say, "Look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What have you done at home these days?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If it were us, we would have rebuked Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But God knew Jacob; He knew that Jacob was a clever, crafty, and supplanting person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He knew that Jacob had more energy than others and a stronger disposition than others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Toward such a person, rebuke and exhortation do not work well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God took Jacob into His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through operating in Jacob's environment, God chipped off a corner here and a corner there; He carved a little here and a little there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If He cannot finish His work in one year, He will do it in two years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If He cannot finish it in ten years, He will finish it in twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God will always finish His work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When God brought Jacob back to Bethel after twenty years, he was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's promise to Jacob actually exceeded the promise He gave to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It also exceeded the promise He gave to Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jacob received something from the Lord that Abraham and Isaac did not receive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God went on to tell Jacob, "And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of" 28:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The promise that God gave to Jacob was unconditional.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He did not say, "If you make Me your God, I will make you My people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you keep My conditions and commandments, you will receive My promise."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>An unconditional promise means that God would always have a way to deal with Jacob whether he was good or bad, honest or cunning.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God knew that one day He would fulfill "that which I have spoken to thee of."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our God is a God who cannot fail.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot stop God, and we cannot cause Him to stop halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If God has chosen us, He will definitely fulfill His promise in us.</S>
