TO EVERY BELIEVER</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery the Lord has given us the divine life, truth, and the proper practice. The light that is being released in these days from the Lord&rsquo;s Word is very clear. If we want the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to spread and increase, we must be strengthened in the matters of begetting, nourishing, and teaching. We are not Christianity, in which most of the people are &ldquo;pew members&rdquo; and only a small number are hired as preachers or pastors because they studied theology. Most Christians think that spreading the gospel, holding home meetings, and teaching the truth are not for the &ldquo;pew members.&rdquo; In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, however, we must all spread the gospel, hold home meetings, and teach the truth.</p>
<p>In Matthew 25:1 the Lord said, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.&rdquo; This indicates that every believer is a virgin. In 24:40-41 the Lord said, &ldquo;Two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left.&rdquo; In order for the two men to be working in the field and the two women to be grinding at the mill, they must be living. The ten virgins in chapter 25 become drowsy and sleep (v. 5). This means that they die. The two believers in chapter 24 are living, and the ten virgins in chapter 25 have died. Two plus ten equals twelve. According to numerical significance, the number twelve represents all of God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>The fact that the ten virgins become drowsy and sleep while they wait for the bridegroom indicates that when the Lord returns, the majority of the believers will have died. Both the foolish and the prudent virgins die. The faithful saints, such as Paul, die, and the slothful saints also die. When the Lord returns, only a small number of believers will still be alive. Some of the believers who are living will be raptured and some will be left. This concerns all of God&rsquo;s people, not only the pastors and preachers. The Lord delivers His possessions to all His slaves, not to only a few of His slaves. He delivers His possessions to those who were strong and capable and to those who were weak and not as capable. This parable shows that every believer should serve the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR LIVING TODAY BEING TO SERVE THE LORD</h2>
<p>We did not appoint leaders in the home meetings, because as soon as there is a leader, the saints stop functioning. Any brother in a home meeting can baptize a gospel friend who wants to be baptized. The principle should be the same in the church service. The Lord Jesus sees all believers as virgins and slaves. According to life, all the believers should be chaste virgins; they should be pure in heart. Whether they are male or female, young or old, their eyes should be fixed on the Lord, and they should not have any other goal. Every believer should be like this. Even though we are living in the world, we are going forth to meet our Bridegroom with our lamps. The lamp is our testimony. In the aspect of life we go out of the world to meet the Lord, bearing His testimony.</p>
<p>In the aspect of work we are the Lord&rsquo;s slaves, and our living is to serve the Lord. A full-timer is a person who lives unto the Lord and is for the Lord; his person, life, living, and career are unto the Lord and for the Lord. A person who has the ability to conduct business but not the gift of preaching the gospel should offer the money he makes for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>In Luke 16:9 the Lord said, &ldquo;Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.&rdquo; We can use unrighteous mammon to spread the gospel and save sinners. The money we offer is used to buy Bibles and spiritual books or to support the full-timers who preach the gospel; therefore, people are saved. Our giving enables us to participate in their salvation.</p>
<p>Those who love the Lord will be surprised to see crowds of people welcoming them when they meet the Lord. Someone may never go to America, but because his money went there for the work, there will be Americans saying that they were helped by him. Those who are saved through his offering are credited to his heavenly account. The brothers who do business and use their money only to buy land, houses, or stock are not faithful. A person who uses his money faithfully for the Lord&rsquo;s need is living full time unto the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING WATCHFUL AND READY<br />
AND BEING FAITHFUL AND DILIGENT</h2>
<p>The full-timers should work diligently on the campuses and in the towns and villages. They should also go door to door to visit people. Whomever they bring to salvation will be credited to their heavenly account. Apart from taking care of their living and their children&rsquo;s education, the believers with jobs should use their money absolutely for the Lord. Any person who is saved and perfected through their offering will be credited to their account, and the churches that are built up through their offering will also be credited to their account. Working full time for the Lord and making money full time for the Lord are two ways to effectively use the Lord&rsquo;s gift. This is what Matthew 25 refers to when it says that the slave who received five talents gained another five talents (v. 16). The talents given by the Lord refer to grace, which is a gift. We should use this grace to earn interest.</p>
<p>The Lord has given us physical health, good education, and a proper environment. We should not forget the source of all that we enjoy. Everything we have is from the Lord. He is the source. According to the Lord&rsquo;s grace His ministry is here; otherwise, we would not succeed in any of our endeavors. Even the full-timers would not succeed. Hence, we should not waste our days. One day the Lord will say, &ldquo;I gave you talents by placing you in the church and giving you the truth. I also gave you a good job and good health, and I met your needs. What did you do with your talents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord has shown us that the three crucial matters needed in building up the church are begetting, nourishing, and teaching. We must seize the opportunity to serve, even if we are newly baptized brothers and sisters. We are all virgins and slaves. As virgins we must be watchful and ready, and as slaves we must be faithful and diligent. Being watchful and ready means that we fellowship with the Lord every day so that our lamps shine brightly. We must also buy oil, which signifies the Holy Spirit. The Spirit in our spirit enables us to shine. However, it is not enough to rely on the oil that is in our lamps; we also need oil in our vessels. The oil in our vessel can be added to our lamp whenever there is a need. Our vessel is our soul, and our lamp is our spirit. The Spirit should be not only in our spirit. He also needs to fill and saturate our entire being, including our mind, emotion, and will. The prudent virgins have oil in their lamps, and they also have plenty of oil in their vessels.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Crucial Matters for the Increase and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
