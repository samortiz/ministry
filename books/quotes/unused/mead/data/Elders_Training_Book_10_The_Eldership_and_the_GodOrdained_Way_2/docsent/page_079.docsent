   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Need for the Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>among the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our problem today is related to the matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are in the fellowship of the recovery, but do we fellowship?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, do the brothers in Sacramento fellowship with the brothers in Chicago, Cleveland, or Wichita?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among the churches in the Lord's recovery, there is not much fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen that the problems between Barnabas and Saul were probably due to a lack of proper and adequate fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are not in fellowship, problems can come in among us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The circulation of blood in our physical body is a good picture of the fellowship, the flow of the divine life, in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If our blood circulation is not proper, this can cause much sickness to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The proper blood circulation swallows up all kinds of germs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was in Taipei for about five years beginning in late 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After about three of those years, trouble came in among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The trouble in the churches today is due to the shortage of the fellowship, the circulation of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This lack of fellowship gave the enemy an opportunity to come in.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are even very short of fellowship with the churches who are close to us geographically.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is very little circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If my shoulder were not participating adequately in the blood circulation of my body, it would be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No part of my physical body can be separate from the other parts since all the parts must participate in the one blood circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some may think that they are wise to keep themselves separate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if any part of the Body of Christ is separate, that part will eventually die.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The best way to stay healthy is to "receive more blood and to give more blood," that is, to stay in the fellowship, the circulation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we will save ourselves and promote the healing of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In some places there has been no peace because of a lack of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more fellowship we have, the more peace we have.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason why many people are weak physically is because they sit too much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They do not move.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is the same spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are sick and weak because we remain with ourselves, in ourselves, and for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are sick because we are so much in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to get out of ourselves by fellowshipping with the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we want to get helped, the secret is to go to see some brothers in another locality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The brothers in Texas should not have traffic among themselves only.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They need to go to Chicago, Cleveland, and Seattle, and break the boundary of Texas.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I would like to make a proposal to the leading brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps ten days from today, fifty brothers from fifty cities can go to a certain church to be in their Lord's Day morning meeting at 10 a.m. I can assure you that you will receive the help and that the church will be helped.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today there are many opinions among the churches concerning the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Other churches have opinions concerning the church in Cleveland and the church in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church in a certain city may have many opinions about other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Each local church may have some opinions about other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All of these opinions need to be thrown away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can they be thrown away?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They can be thrown away by the circulation, the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the waste in our physical body is not discharged regularly, we will die.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The circulation of blood within our body is like a river that always carries away the waste in our being so that it can be discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In like manner, the fellowship in the Body carries away all the negative things.</S>
