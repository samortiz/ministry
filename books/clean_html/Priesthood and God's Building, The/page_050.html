<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE INITIATIVE TO PRAY<br />
AND THE SPIRIT JOINING IN</h2>
<p>As we advance in our experience of the Lord, the inspiration of the Spirit will become less of a factor when we pray. When we first began to pray, we often waited for the inspiration of the Spirit, but as we advance, we need to take the initiative to pray and not wait for the Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration. The way of the Spirit is to join in after we begin to pray (Rom. 8:26); that is, when we pray, the Spirit moves in our spirit. If we take the initiative to pray, the Spirit will move. If we do not take the initiative, the Spirit will not move. The Spirit can be likened to the engine of a car. In order to drive a car, we need to start the engine by turning the key. The proper sequence for driving a car involves turning the key to start the engine. When we were saved, God&rsquo;s care for us included His moving in us through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. However, as we go deeper in the Lord, this kind of inspiration becomes less and less frequent because God desires that we take the initiative in prayer. We should not wait for the Holy Spirit to move before we pray; rather, we should take the initiative to pray, and the Holy Spirit will join in.</p>
<p>Taking the initiative requires regular exercise. Some saints are so exercised that as long as they take even a little initiative, the Spirit moves within them. It is as if the Spirit is under their control. This can be compared to turning on a faucet; as soon as a faucet is turned on, water will begin to flow out. However, no water will flow out if we are not willing to turn on the faucet. We need to learn to turn on the Spirit so that He can move within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THRONE OF GRACE BEING IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Even though we may know spiritual teachings, we can be short in our spiritual exercise. Objectively speaking, the Holy of Holies is in the heavens, but in order to subjectively enter into the Holy of Holies, we need to exercise our spirit. The throne of grace is in our spirit (Heb. 4:16). In John 4:14 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life,&rdquo; and in 7:38 He said, &ldquo;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; The Lord desires to become a fountain in us so that rivers of living water will flow out from us. This can be seen in the New Jerusalem, which is a sign that relates more to our experience today than it does to prophecies of things in the future. Revelation 22:1 says, &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the throne of God and of the Lamb. God is in His Son, the Lamb, and His Son dwells in us. Hence, the throne of God is also in us. This throne is related both to ruling and to giving grace because the flow from the throne is not a stream of fire for judgment (cf. Dan. 7:10) but a stream of water for life. The stream of fire is for judging, whereas the stream of water is for bestowing grace, moistening, and supplying. Furthermore, the tree of life that grows on this side and on that side of the river is also for supplying.</p>
<p>The reality of the New Jerusalem is realized in our spirit. God is present in both the New Jerusalem and our spirit. God is on the throne in both the New Jerusalem and our spirit. God as light with Christ as the lamp is shining in both the New Jerusalem and our spirit. Furthermore, the river of water of life is flowing continually in both the New Jerusalem and our spirit. Today the throne of grace is in our spirit because our spirit is the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RIVERS OF LIVING WATER<br />
FLOWING OUT OF OUR INNERMOST BEING</h2>
<p>God desires to flow out from our spirit as rivers of living water. In John 7:38 Jesus said, &ldquo;He who believes into Me...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; Then in verse 39, John explained the Lord&rsquo;s words, saying, &ldquo;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; These verses show that the Spirit is realized as rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being. The river of water of life in Revelation 22:1 also refers to the Spirit, and the tree of life growing on either side refers to Christ. Hence, the Spirit proceeds out from the throne of God&rsquo;s grace and authority, bringing Christ into all God&rsquo;s redeemed. This is a description of the reality in our spirit. Although there is a throne of God objectively in the Holy of Holies in heaven, God has also set up His throne of grace in our spirit as the Holy of Holies so that He may flow out from our inner being as rivers of living water.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:19-20 says, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way.&rdquo; We should enter into the Holy of Holies with boldness through the Lord&rsquo;s blood, because Christ has initiated a new and living way for us. If the Holy of Holies is only in heaven, it would not be possible for us to enter into the Holy of Holies. Therefore, the Holy of Holies spoken of in verse 19 must refer to our spirit. Furthermore, 4:16 also speaks of the throne of grace. If the throne of grace is only in heaven, it would not be possible for us to come forward to the throne of grace. Hebrews 10:19 and 4:16 both refer to our spirit.</p>
<p>If we compare Hebrews 4:16 with the pictures in Revelation 22 and John 7, we can see that grace and mercy flow out of the throne of God. Whenever we turn to our spirit, to the Holy of Holies, and touch the throne of grace, the Holy Spirit flows and waters. When the Holy Spirit flows, He brings mercy and grace as our timely supply. Thus, God in the Lamb flows into us through the Spirit to comfort, water, and supply us with mercy and grace for our timely help.</p>
