   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>James 1:2 says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, whenever you fall into various trials."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Peter 1:6 says, "In which time you exult."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 8 says, "Whom having not seen, you love; into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing, you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter four, verses 12 and 13 say, "Beloved, do not think that the fiery ordeal among you, coming to you for a trial, is strange, as if it were a strange thing happening to you; but inasmuch as you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice exultingly."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These few passages tell us how we should behave in the days of tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The book of James speaks of "various trials."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This includes the trials that one should face as well as trials that one should not face; they come all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Enemies come, friends come, unbelievers come, brothers come, and reasonable as well as unreasonable things come.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All kinds of trials come, but these things cannot take away our joy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please remember that the Bible always qualifies joy with such adjectives as great and full.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of God's joys are great and full.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Peter 1:6 says that one greatly rejoices, while the grief is but for "a little while" RSV .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can there be grief?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yes, there can; in fact, grief is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While our eyes are here, tears will always come.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as our tear ducts are here, tears will always come.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But even though there may be tears, there is also rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, 1 Peter 1:8 speaks of "joy that is unspeakable and full of glory."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no way to describe this joy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many times, while our tears are still wet, we are already shouting, "Hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many times, while tears are still rolling, our mouths are thanking and praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many people have tears that are mingled with their thanksgiving and praises.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Miss M.E. Barber wrote a hymn with one line which says, "Let the spirit praise Thee,/Though the heart be riven" Hymns, #377 . While we live on earth today, our heart cannot help but be riven at times.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The heart has its feelings, yet the spirit can still praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First Peter 4:12 says that we should rejoice not only in the midst of trials, but also in anticipation of the trials.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that we should welcome the trials and say, "Praise and thank the Lord, the trials are here again."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some brothers raise their eyebrows as soon as trials come to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They murmur, "Here they are again!"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But Peter told us to thank God joyfully that they are here again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever we praise and thank the Lord, we are above the trials.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nothing can put us above the temptations, circumstances, and difficulties more than joy, thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the proper tone of victory; it is expressed in an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A sister in Chefoo who entered the overcoming experience was under severe trials.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Her daughter died within a matter of hours, and her husband was away in a distant place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the daughter died, the brothers and sisters went over to comfort her.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although her eyes were full of tears, her face was full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She said, "Thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although I do not understand why my child is dead, I am still full of joy."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The brothers and sisters tried to comfort her; instead, she comforted them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such joy cannot be fabricated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Victory is maintained by this kind of tone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One can still praise the Lord joyfully in the midst of trials.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let me say a word that might not appeal to you: Christians are a pattern to others on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God has placed us on earth as a pattern to others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we weep when others weep and become frustrated when others are frustrated, we will become the same as everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Where then is our victory?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should show the world that in the midst of these matters, we have joy and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may appear crazy to them, but they will hunger after the Christ who makes us so "crazy."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May the Lord be gracious to us so that we will express the victory of Christ in the midst of tribulations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Matthew 5:11-12 says, "Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens." When others reproach us, we may endure it; when they persecute us, we may not speak back.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But enduring and shutting up are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we only endure and shut up, we are already defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The world can endure and shut up as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The monks can do the same, and so can the scholars of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should be different from them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When others reproach us, we should be able to say, "Praise and thank the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should consider it a joy that others reproach us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When others persecute us, we should thank and praise the Lord and consider this a matter of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If our victory is a genuine victory, we should rejoice and exult.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If victory merely means suffering reproach, it is just human work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Human work results in suppression, while every work of the Lord results in joy and exultation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brothers and sisters, the test is in our tone.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The greatest mistake today is that man considers endurance to be the greatest virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When others reproach us, can we rejoice greatly?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When others reproach us, are we merely looking at the floor and shutting our mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are many people who experience persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There are many sisters who are persecuted by their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many people experience slanders and lies.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What do they do?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They pray that the Lord would keep them from losing their temper or becoming angry with others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They think that as long as they do not lose their temper and do not blow up, they have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But have they really overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is true that they have the victory, but it is not the victory that the Lord gives.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If it is the Lord's victory, they can thank and praise the Lord greatly in the midst of the reproach and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Let me repeat: Whenever we find that we cannot thank and praise the Lord, we are defeated already.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The tone of victory is thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There was a man who sat on a tram beside a great enemy of his.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This man was a brother, and he prayed to the Lord, saying, "Lord, keep me."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>While he prayed, he maintained a nice attitude and even conversed with his enemy on subjects like the news and sports.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But within him, he was constantly praying that the Lord would cause his enemy to get off the tram before he did and that the Lord would keep him overcoming all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Finally, after much struggling, he arrived at his destination and got off the tram.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He sighed a long sigh of relief and said, "I have overcome."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But what kind of victory is this?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is a cheating victory, a man-made victory, and an empty victory.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If it were God's victory, there would have been no need to ask the Lord to keep him or help him endure.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He only needed to say, "God, I thank and praise You that You have put me here.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Since You have put me here, it does not matter whether You leave me here for a longer time."</S>
