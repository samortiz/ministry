<p>From the beginning, God&rsquo;s desire has been to gain a group of people who are both priests and kings. He has a need for prophets only as a remedial measure when there is desolation in the priesthood and kingship. There are prophets in both the Old and New Testaments, but in the kingdom age and in the new heaven and the new earth in eternity, prophecies will be rendered useless. First Corinthians 13:8 says, &ldquo;Whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease.&rdquo; Both prophecies and tongues will pass away, but the priesthood and the kingship will exist forever (Rev. 22:3, 5). In the Old Testament age, the ministry of the prophets was strong when God&rsquo;s people were in a poor condition. If the ministry of the word is being manifested in the church in the New Testament age, it is because most of the brothers and sisters are in a downward condition. This is not a normal situation. If every child of God is functioning as a priest, the service of the priesthood will be strong and normal, and the ministry of the word will not be as prominent in the church.</p>
<p>I hope that we will clearly see God&rsquo;s intention for His chosen and redeemed people to be priests with His image and kings with His authority. Our concepts, however, are often contrary to God&rsquo;s intention, and we have neglected the matter of the universal priesthood. In Christianity today, most people pay attention only to the ministry of the word. For this reason, in most meetings Christian messages are given by designated persons who speak and pray as &ldquo;priests.&rdquo; This is an abnormal situation.</p>
<p>In these days God is leading us to establish the testimony of the church, and He is also leading us to see the need to build up the church. Hence, the priesthood must be recovered among us. Furthermore, this recovery should involve more than just a small number of saints; instead, all the saints must rise up to receive grace and exercise to function as priests. We should contact God not only individually but also corporately. Our meetings should be meetings of priests; we all should be ministering and serving before God as priests. Such a service is according to the Bible, and it reflects the initial condition of the church during the time of the apostles. In the early church, the believers did not come together to listen to one person&rsquo;s speaking. According to 1 Corinthians 14, all the saints exercised their spirits in the meetings of the church. Some exercised to pray, some exercised to speak for God, some exercised to sing to God, and some exercised to interpret tongues or to speak a word of wisdom or a word of knowledge (v. 26; 12:8, 10). Instead of sitting and listening to a message, the saints functioned as priests before God.</p>
<p>It is common for believers not to function because the church has become more degraded and more desolate. Many believers are accustomed to just sitting and listening to a message. It seems as if the ministry of the word is prevailing, while the priesthood is greatly lacking. This does not mean that I oppose the matter of ministering the word; instead, I desire that every saint would be a priest. In every gathering the spirits of the saints should be living and strong. This is the normal way; it is also God&rsquo;s way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE PRIESTLY MINISTRY<br />
IN THE MEETINGS OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Abolishing the Lord&rsquo;s Day Message Meeting<br />
and Taking the Way of Pursuing in Small Groups</h2>
<p>After much prayer and fellowship, many elders feel that the meetings of the church should not depend just upon one man&rsquo;s speaking; rather, our meetings should be a gathering of priests who serve God together. Therefore, beginning with the last Lord&rsquo;s Day in March, we will drop the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting. This does not mean that we will no longer have ministry message meetings; we will still have meetings to minister the word of God, especially when there is a need for leading in a certain matter. Such meetings will relate to specific and timely needs. For our regular meetings, however, we will no longer have message meetings, as we have in the past. We must drop the concept of a &ldquo;worship service,&rdquo; which has been passed down from Christianity. Instead, our meetings must become meetings in which everyone is a worshipping priest who burns incense, lights the lamps, sings, and ministers before God.</p>
<p>This decision is based on several factors. It has been more than a decade since we began the work in Taiwan in 1949. During this time, many people have been saved and raised up by the Lord. In the first few years, we did not feel that there was a problem with the way we met. However, by 1954, when a large number of people were saved and had received some edification, we discovered some problems. For example, when all the saints would come together to listen to the same message, the more experienced ones did not receive much help, because they had heard similar messages in the past. However, new believers had difficulty understanding the message because the speaker was trying to speak to &ldquo;elementary students&rdquo; and &ldquo;college students&rdquo; at the same time. As a result, the more experienced saints did not progress, and the new believers did not receive much benefit. When a meeting cannot meet the practical needs of the saints, new ones fall behind and leave, and other saints do not progress.</p>
<p>After considering this situation before the Lord, we feel that we must adopt a way that involves some principles of education. Although messages are needed to edify the saints and supply them in their spirit, the messages still need to have an instructional element. Since instruction always involves education, we are considering dividing the saints into &ldquo;classes.&rdquo; We have been in Taiwan for more than a decade. If we had followed the principles of our educational system, we should have a college-level understanding of the truth. However, many brothers and sisters who have been among us since 1949 can still be considered as being &ldquo;elementary&rdquo; students. Even though they love the Lord fervently, pursue Him, and attend the meetings, they are not able to speak something substantial. Thus, we need to consider how to lead the saints according to their spiritual condition.</p>
<p>Although we do not have absolute assurance that this new arrangement will work, we should try. First, we can simply divide the brothers and sisters into two levels&mdash;those who have more spiritual experience in matters such as being consecrated to the Lord, fellowshipping with Him, and understanding basic items of the truth, and those who are newer in their experience of salvation.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
