   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRITUAL MAN WRITTEN IN SICKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After praying for over a month, I felt that I should write a book concerning what I had learned before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My concept had been that one should not write books until he was old, but when I considered that I might be leaving this earth, I felt I should begin writing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I rented a small room in Wusih, Kiangsu province, where I shut myself up and spent my days writing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time my disease became so aggravated that I could not even lie down.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While writing I sat on a chair with a high back and pressed my chest against the desk to alleviate the pain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Satan said to me, "Since you will soon be dying, why not die in comparative comfort rather than in pain?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I retorted, "The Lord wants me just like this; get out of here!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It took four months to complete the three volumes of The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The writing of this book was a real labor of blood, sweat, and tears.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I despaired of life, yet God's grace brought me through.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After completing each time of writing, I would say to myself, "This is my last testimony to the church."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Though the writing was done in the midst of all sorts of difficulties and hardships, I felt that God was unusually near to me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some felt God was ill-treating me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Cheng wrote saying, "You are exerting yourself to the uttermost; some day you will regret it."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I replied, "I love my Lord and I would live for Him."...</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>SICKNESS WORSENED</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Following the publication of the book, I prayed, "Now let Your servant depart in peace."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the same time my disease worsened.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I could not sleep peacefully at night, and when I awoke I turned incessantly from side to side.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Physically, I was a bag of bones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I had night sweats, and my voice became hoarse.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>People had trouble hearing me speak, even when they placed their ear to my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Several sisters took turns waiting upon me, one of whom was a veteran nurse.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever she saw me, she would weep.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She testified, "I have seen many patients, but I have never seen one whose condition was as pitiful as his.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am afraid that he can live only three or four more days."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When someone told me of this, I said, "Let this be my end. I realize I am going to die soon." One brother telegraphed the churches in various places, telling them there was no more hope for me and that they need pray for me no more.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>HEALED</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day I asked God, "Why are You calling me away so soon?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I confessed my trespasses before God, fearing that I might have been unfaithful concerning some matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the same time I told God that I had no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On that same day I devoted myself to fasting and praying and presented myself to Him once more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I told Him that I would do nothing but what He assigned me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From morning until three o'clock in the afternoon I fasted.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the same time the co-workers earnestly prayed together for me in Sister Ruth Lee's home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As I prayed to God to grant me faith, He spoke His words to me, words which I could never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first sentence was, "The just shall live by faith" Rom 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The second sentence was, "By faith you stand" 2 Cor 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The third sentence was, "We walk by faith" 2 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These words filled me with great joy, for the Bible says, "All things are possible to him who believes" Mark 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I immediately thanked and praised God because He had given me His words.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I believed that God had cured me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The test came immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible says, "By faith you stand," but I was still lying in bed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A conflict arose in my mind: Should I get up and stand or remain lying down?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all know that human beings love themselves and consider it more comfortable to die in bed than to die standing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then the word of God manifested its power, and ignoring all else, I put on my clothing, clothing which I had not worn for a hundred and seventy-six days.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As I left the bed to stand, I perspired so profusely that it was as though I had been soaked through with rain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Satan said to me, "Are you trying to stand when you can't even sit up?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I retorted, "God told me to stand," and I rose to my feet.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Being again in a cold sweat, I nearly fell down.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I kept repeating, "Stand by faith, stand by faith!"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I then walked a few steps to get my trousers and socks.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After putting on my trousers, I sat down.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No sooner was I seated than the word of God came to me that I should not only stand by faith but also walk by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I felt that the ability to rise and walk a few steps to get my trousers and socks was already something marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How could I expect to walk further?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Where do You want me to go?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I asked God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He answered, "Go downstairs to Sister Lee's home at number 215."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A number of brothers and sisters had been fasting and praying for me there for two or three days.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Walking within the room might be all right, I thought, but how could I walk downstairs?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I prayed to God, "Oh God, I can stand by faith, and by faith I am also able to walk downstairs!"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Immediately, I went to the door leading to the staircase and opened it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I tell you honestly that when I stood at the top of the staircase it seemed to me to be the tallest staircase I had ever seen in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I said to God, "If You tell me to walk I will do so, even if I die as a result of the effort."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But I continued, "Lord, I cannot walk.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I pray that You will support me with Your hand while I am walking."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>With one hand holding onto the rail, I descended step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Again I was in a cold sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As I walked down the stairs, I continued to cry out, "Walk by faith, walk by faith!"</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>With each step down, I prayed, "Oh Lord, it is You who enable me to walk."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>While descending those twenty-five steps, it seemed I was walking hand in hand with the Lord in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Upon reaching the bottom of the stairway, I felt very strong and went quickly to the rear door.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I opened the door and headed straight for Sister Lee's home.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I said to the Lord, "From now on, I will live by faith and will no longer be an invalid."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I knocked at the door just as Peter did in Acts 12:12-17, but without Rhoda to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When the door was opened and I entered the house, seven or eight brothers and sisters gazed at me.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They were speechless and motionless.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>For about an hour everyone sat quietly as if God had appeared among men.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I also sat there full of thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then I related all that had happened in the course of my being graciously healed.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Exhilarated and jubilant in spirit, we all praised God aloud for His wonderful work.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>That same day we hired a car to go to Kiangwan in the suburbs to visit Dora Yu, the famous woman evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>She was greatly shocked to see me, for she had received recent news of my imminent death.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When I appeared, I was looked upon as one who had been raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>That was another occasion of joyful thanksgiving and praise before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>On the following Sunday, I spoke on the platform for three hours.</S>
