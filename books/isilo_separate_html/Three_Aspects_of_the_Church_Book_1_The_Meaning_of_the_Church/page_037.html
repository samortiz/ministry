<p>Before God saved the children of Israel, He chose them to be His people. Hence, the children of Israel are God&rsquo;s elect, that is, a people chosen by God. This typifies the church being chosen by God in Christ before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Going Down to Egypt</h2>
<p>The children of Israel went down to Egypt and fell into Pharaoh&rsquo;s hand, typifying the church, chosen by God in eternity, falling into the satanic world under the authority of Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Redeemed by God</h2>
<p>The children of Israel kept the passover in Egypt, typifying the church being redeemed by God. The church not only fell into the world and was under the authority of Satan, but she also fell into sin and was under God&rsquo;s condemnation. Hence, she needed the redemption of Christ as the Passover.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Rescued from the World</h2>
<p>The children of Israel came out of Egypt, that is, the world. When they came out of Egypt, they crossed the Red Sea. The crossing of the Red Sea typifies the baptism of the church, signifying that the church died with Christ and has been buried with Him. There is a sea that separates God&rsquo;s people from Egypt, and this sea is the water of baptism. This sea separates the church from the world. The church has come out of the world, having passed through baptism. Baptism is a deliverance; it delivers us from the world. By being buried in baptism, we are separated from the world.</p>
<p>There are two aspects in God&rsquo;s complete salvation: redemption and salvation. Fallen man is under God&rsquo;s condemnation and the bondage of Satan. In regard to God&rsquo;s condemnation, there is the need for the shedding of the blood of the Lamb for redemption. In regard to the bondage of Satan, there is a need to be saved by God&rsquo;s arm and God&rsquo;s great power. According to the sequence of the fall, man fell first under the authority of Satan and then under God&rsquo;s condemnation. However, according to the sequence of God&rsquo;s salvation, we are first redeemed from condemnation and then saved from bondage.</p>
<p>The children of Israel kept the passover by killing the lamb and applying the blood. In God&rsquo;s eyes, this is a matter of redemption; this is a matter of substitution, not of power. The lamb suffered God&rsquo;s judgment on behalf of the children of Israel. Later when the children of Israel fled Egypt, the Egyptian army followed them and was drowned in the Red Sea. At that time, the Israelites saw God&rsquo;s arm, God&rsquo;s power. This was not a matter of substitution but of power. In our salvation these two events occurred simultaneously. Because of the blood of the Lord Jesus, we escaped God&rsquo;s condemnation and were forgiven and justified by God. At the same time, the power of the Holy Spirit came upon us to save us out of the authority of Satan and to deliver us from the bondage of Egypt.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Journeying through the Wilderness</h2>
<p>Egypt typifies the world in which people are usurped by Satan and where God&rsquo;s elect are under Satan&rsquo;s usurpation, whereas the wilderness refers to the world in which people wander and the place through which God&rsquo;s elect pass. God&rsquo;s elect are in the world before their salvation, and they wander in the wilderness after their salvation. On the one hand, the church has come out of the usurping world of Satan; on the other hand, the church remains on the earth, wandering in the wilderness as a sojourner without roots in the earth. The journey in the wilderness also typifies the period of the church&rsquo;s immaturity. During this period of immaturity and wandering, the church has yet to attain to God&rsquo;s purpose or come up to God&rsquo;s standard.</p>
<p>There is a twofold significance in the type of the children of Israel crossing the Red Sea and journeying through the wilderness. On the one hand, the church is a sojourner, a pilgrim, and a wanderer on the earth; on the other hand, the church has not yet reached maturity, come up to God&rsquo;s standard, or arrived at the heavenly Canaan. To the church, both Egypt and the wilderness typify the world. Egypt typifies the world that usurps people, and the wilderness typifies the world in which people wander. Egypt is the place where God&rsquo;s chosen people were usurped, and the wilderness is the place where God&rsquo;s elect journeyed. Before we were saved, we were in Egypt; after we are saved, we are in the wilderness. Before our salvation, we were under the usurpation of the world; after our salvation, we are sojourning in the world. In the world we are not settled but journeying from place to place as sojourners and pilgrims. Because God&rsquo;s elect were sojourners and pilgrims, the tabernacle that followed them was portable, having no permanent attachment to the earth, and was not as a house built in a fixed location. The type of the children of Israel in the wilderness indicates that the church is still wandering and journeying in the world and that the church has not yet matured, attained God&rsquo;s purpose, or entered the spiritual Canaan.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
