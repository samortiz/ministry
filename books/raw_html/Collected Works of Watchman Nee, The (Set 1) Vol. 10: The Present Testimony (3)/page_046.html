<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TWO SIDES OF THE TRUTHâ€”<br>SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Notes from a Meeting Held in 1932)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 29</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 3:16; 14:16; 15:4-5; 14:17; 6:47; 4:14; 1 John 2:8; Phil. 1:20-21; 1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 1:27</H1><P>We often speak about the matter of subjective truth and objective truth. All the truths in the New Testament are divided into these two categories, and similarly all the Old Testament truths are divided into these two categories. To make this matter clear to many of you, I would first like to explain the meaning of the words objective and subjective. The literal meanings of the Chinese words for objective and subjective are "guest's view" and "host's view." Being objective is viewing things from the position of a guest or an outsider, and being subjective is viewing things from one's self as a host. Viewing things from the position of an outsider is being objective, and viewing things from within is being subjective. Whatever occurs in others is objective; whatever occurs in me is subjective. All the truths that are not in me are objective truths; all the truths that are inside of me are subjective truths. All the truths outside of me are objective truths; they are truths, even though they are outside of me. All the experiences within me are subjective and are also truths. The Bible places equal weight on both aspects of these truths. I would now like to give you some illustrations.</P><P>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son." John 14:16 says, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter." It is sad that many who can recite John 3:16 so well cannot recite John 14:16. Actually these two verses are of equal worth. God had two "givings." In John 3:16 He gave His Son to us, and in John 14:16 He gave the Holy Spirit to us. God gave His Son to sinners, and He gave the Holy Spirit to the ones who believe in His Son. God gave His Son to the world that they may be saved through Him. God gave the Holy Spirit to those who believe in His Son that they may be empowered to overcome. One is the giving of the Son, and the other is the giving of the Holy Spirit. Everything accomplished in the Son is an objective truth, and everything done in us through the working of the Holy Spirit is a subjective truth. Everything that is done in Christ is objective, while everything that is done in us through the Holy Spirit is subjective. When the Lord was crucified on the cross, we were crucified there with Him. This is an objective fact. If we search within ourselves to see whether we have died, we surely will not feel that we have died. Likewise, if we preach the gospel to a sinner, telling him that he is a sinner and Christ has died for him, will he realize he has died with Christ? No matter that is in Christ is subjective. Everything in Christ is objective, and all the work done by the Holy Spirit in us is subjective. The Holy Spirit does not work in Himself; all the work of the Holy Spirit is done within us. What Christ has accomplished is in Himself, and what the Holy Spirit has accomplished is in us. As long as something or some work is done in Christ, it is objective; as long as something is accomplished by the Holy Spirit, it is subjective. Please remember this point: objective matters are in Christ, and subjective matters are within us.</P><P>In John 15:4 the Lord repeated the phrase abide in Me twice. What is it to "abide in Me"? It is just to abide in the Lord. Abiding in the Lord is objective. We must first have the objective aspect before we can have the experience of "I [abide] in you," which is the subjective aspect. We must remember that the words "I [abide] in you" are preceded by the words "Abide in Me." Every subjective experience is based on an objective fact. No one could ever be saved if there was just the working of the Holy Spirit without the accomplishment of Christ. Neither could people be saved by only having the accomplishment of Christ without the working of the Holy Spirit. As I have said before, a man must have two feet to stand firm and two eyes to see clearly. Birds must have two wings to fly. Similarly, we must first be in the Lord, and then He will be in us.</P><P>John 6:47 says, "He who believes has eternal life." Every believer knows this verse. It is true that we have believed, and it is true that he who believes has eternal life. However, no one can locate the eternal life. What does John 4:14 tell us? It says, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life." The water that He will give us is the water of life, and it will well up from within again and again until we sense its flavor. On the one hand, the Lord talks about the eternal life, and on the other hand, He talks about a well of living water springing up which enables us to taste the flavor of eternal life. John 6:47 speaks of the objective aspect, and John 4:14 speaks of the subjective aspect. First John 2:8 says, "...which is true in Him and in you." Some of the truths are in Him, and some of the truths are in us. They are all truths, and we should pay attention to all of them. John 15 tells us how to bear fruit: "He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit" (v. 5). In other words, whenever the objective truth is balanced by the subjective truth, there will be much fruit-bearing. John 14:17 says, "The Spirit of reality...because He abides with you and shall be in you." He abides with you is objective. This phrase points out the fact that the Holy Spirit through Christ was with the disciples. The phrase shall be in you is subjective. It points to the fact of Christ dwelling in the disciples through the Holy Spirit. At one time this word was objective and outside of them, but once the Holy Spirit came and dwelt in them, the objective facts became their subjective experience.</P><P>On one hand, Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:30 said, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus." On the other hand, in Colossians 1:27 Paul said, "Christ in you, the hope of glory." To be in Christ is the objective aspect, and to have Christ in us is the subjective aspect.</P>
