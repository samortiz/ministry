   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another big distraction is anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Anxiety is like a little demon always bothering us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who could live even one day without any kind of anxiety?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Very often wives are anxious concerning their husbands.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once this anxiety enters into her, it will never leave her.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After marriage, a husband and wife may have some children.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the first day their little child is born, they may be anxious whether this child will breathe well, sleep well, and eat well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The parents are anxious for their children from the time of their birth to the time they themselves have children.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are anxious to see whether their children will read well, study well, get the best grades, and graduate from the best university.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then they become anxious concerning their children's marriages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the children's marriages they are anxious concerning the grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This human life is full of anxiety, and this anxiety keeps us away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Philippians, a book on enjoying Christ, Paul tells us, "Be anxious for nothing" 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That means we should not worry about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we all have some worries.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes when we do not have much anxiety today, we borrow the anxiety of tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Very often we borrow anxiety from tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Tomorrow has not yet come, yet we borrow tomorrow's anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We human beings are just people of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But once you have anxiety, you are cut off from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not easy to get rid of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The best way to get rid of anxiety is to tell your need to God Phil 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not worry for anything, but rather unload your care 1 Pet 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You need to charge your anxiety to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To say this is easy, but to practice not having anxiety is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Besides anxiety, another distraction is murmuring Phil 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every married person has murmured about his husband or wife at some time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even in the church life there may be some murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The brothers may murmur about the elders, and the sisters may murmur about the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The young ones may murmur about the older ones, and the older ones may murmur about the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Anxiety and murmuring are two things that so easily keep us away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Philippians is a book on the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This experience is quite often frustrated by these two things, anxiety and murmuring.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the Apostle Paul exhorts us concerning both.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Anger and any kind of agitation also cut us off from the experience of Christ Eph 4:26, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all are too easily agitated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes just a little word will agitate us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both the young people and the older ones are very easily agitated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But any time you are agitated by anything or by anyone, you are distracted from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Anger is an issue of agitation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although it cannot be considered as sin, it surely distracts us from experiencing Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the Apostle exhorts us not to remain in anger to the point where it becomes sin Eph 4:26 .</S>
