   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Without Wrath and Reasoning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 8 Paul also urges the brothers to pray "without wrath and reasoning."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Wrath and reasoning kill our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Wrath is of our emotion, and reasoning is of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To have a prayer life and pray unceasingly, our emotion and mind must be regulated to a normal condition under the control of the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word for reasoning means disputatious reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What Paul is speaking of here is not normal or ordinary reasoning, but a reasoning filled with disputation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must avoid this if we are to pray properly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul's word about not having disputatious reasonings is related to his admonition to lift up holy hands.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we close our eyes and lift up our hands, we shall be able to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if we open our eyes to consider others and reason about their situation, we shall not be able to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead of lifting up our hands, we may clasp them behind our back.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who can pray with his hands clasped behind his back?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if we lift up our hands and refrain from disputatious reasoning, we shall be able to pray in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From experience I have learned that our prayer life can be affected by our mood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I do not keep myself in a proper mood, my prayer life is put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Anger always destroys our prayer life for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a brother loses his temper with his wife, he may find that he cannot pray properly for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are to have a prayer life, we must learn not to be moody or angry with others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the Lord's grace that is with our spirit, we must exercise a strict control over our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE SISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 9, Paul turns to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He begins this verse with the word "similarly."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This refers to "I will" in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It may also indicate that Paul's word about praying in every place applies to the sisters as well as to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A. Adorning Themselves</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 9 says, "Similarly, that women adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Proper clothing denotes what is fitting to the sisters' nature and position as saints of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Clothing in Greek implies deportment, demeanor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Clothing is the main sign of a sister's demeanor, and it must befit her saintly position.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Greek word rendered modesty literally is shamefastness, that is, bound or made fast by an honorable shame Vincent , implying not forward or overbold, but moderate, observing the proprieties of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sobriety denotes sober-mindedness, self-restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It means to restrict oneself soberly and discreetly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sisters in a local assembly should clothe themselves with these two virtues shamefastness and self-restraint as their demeanor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 10 Paul continues, "But, what befits women professing godly reverence, by good works."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Godly reverence is reverence toward God; it is the revering and honoring of God as those who worship Him should.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>B. Learning</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 11 Paul says, "Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Quietness means silence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For a sister to learn in silence and in all subjection is to realize her position as a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This safeguards the sisters from the presumption of overstepping their position in the local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 12 continues, "But I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To teach here means to teach with authority, to define and decide the meaning of doctrines concerning divine truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For a woman to teach in this way or to exercise authority over a man is to leave her position.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In God's creation man was ordained to be the head, and woman was to be in subjection to man 1 Cor 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This ordination should be kept in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word quietness in verse 12 refers to silence from speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In verse 13 Paul offers a word of explanation, "For Adam was formed first, then Eve."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This brings us to the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God always wants to bring us back to His beginning Matt 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In verse 14 Paul goes on, "And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being quite deceived was in transgression."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 13 gives the first reason that a woman should subject herself to man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here is the second.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eve was deceived by the serpent Gen 3:1-6 because she did not remain in subjection under the headship of Adam, but overstepped her position to contact the evil tempter directly without her head being covered.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the strong ground for the apostle not to permit the sisters in a local assembly to teach with authority or to exercise authority over men, but to learn in silence and remain in all subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Man's headship is woman's protection.</S>
