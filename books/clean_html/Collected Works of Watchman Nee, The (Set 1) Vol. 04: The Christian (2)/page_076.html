<P>Our present world is truly a wilderness. In it we encounter trials and oppositions. Hence, the wilderness is a place where man trusts in God. Although darkness surrounds us, faith sees the eternal arm working for us. It is here that we understand the grace of the One who has come among us. "A brother is born for adversity" (Prov. 17:17). It is in adversity that we realize the preciousness of a brother. Only adversity will make one realize what a brother is. "There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother" (Prov. 18:24). We can feel that the Lord of glory is closer to us than anyone else. What a comforting thought this is! He is not only our Lord, protecting us; He is also in our midst, walking with us, holding our hands, sympathizing with us, and speaking words of comfort to us. He knows all our sufferings, and He knows how to comfort those who are in the sufferings.</P><P>How wonderful is such condescension! How precious it is! Unless a man truly has the experience of a sojourner and is truly poor in worldly things, being rich only through the grace of Him who became poor for us, he will not understand the deepest meaning of the Lord's descending to the earth. It is for this reason that only those who have tasted of the manna in the wilderness can enjoy the hidden manna. The manna was given in no other place except the wilderness. To enjoy the manna, one has to go to the wilderness. Those believers who have lost their sojourning characteristics no longer consider the world the wilderness. Instead they consider it their comfortable home. How can they expect to have the manna as their food? Later generations of Israelites could see the food eaten by the former Israelites in the wilderness. It is true that they were in Canaan. Yet other than seeing the manna, they could have no other experiences of their own. Only those who had passed through the wilderness could say that they had eaten the manna and could tell of the taste of it. The Lord told us the taste of the manna: "the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil" (Num. 11:8). This speaks of the work of the Holy Spirit. In other places, it tells us that "the taste of it was like wafers made with honey" (Exo. 16:31). This speaks of our Lord Jesus. He is a wafer made with honey. It is not just honey, for too much honey will make one vomit. This is a daily food. It has the taste of honey yet does not have the excessive repugnance of it. It has the taste of the fresh oil, being forever refreshing and fresh.</P><P>However, taste is something that a man has to experience himself. A man can only tell of the taste of something by comparison. Those who listen can only hear the comparison from the mouth of the ones who have tasted. Regardless of how others would describe it, those who do not eat cannot understand its taste. For this reason, we have to taste to see if the Lord is good. All those who are in the wilderness have a chance to taste the manna. Those who have not passed through the wilderness can also hear about it, but they cannot have the personal experience of it. What we lose today can never be recovered in eternity. Whatever little we can add to our experience of the Lord, that little we will add to our joyful recollection in eternity.</P><P>The manna in the wilderness was not hidden. To those who pass through the wilderness, the manna is indeed not hidden. In the glory in heaven, we will recognize the man Jesus Christ. We will see Him and know Him as the slain Lamb. The heavens and all that is in them will worship Him. Heaven will have no need of manna, for in Canaan one cannot find the food of the wilderness. The manna enjoyed in Canaan surely comes from a wilderness that is very different from the condition in Canaan. We will enjoy the hidden manna in heaven, but the experience comes from earth. Our best feelings today are but blurry! We only know of a fraction of the power of the Holy Spirit! We have not longed after or enjoyed that much of the beauty of the humbled Christ! Will we fully know His condescension from heaven to earth when we behold His glory face to face in the future? Now is the time for us to examine ourselves. How much material have we prepared now for our enjoyment in heaven? How much have we longed after and desired Christ? It is true that we have eternal life already. We should thank the Lord that we have received this already. Yet this is only the beginning. Have we started on the journey that is set apart from the world, or are we like all others, living in the world? Either we belong to one group or we belong to the other. Either we are outside the world and opposing the world, or we are in the world and walking according to it.</P><P>We have seen that the "hidden manna" refers to the personal experience of every believer toward the Lord, of his personal experience of looking to the Lord, marvelling at the Lord, loving the Lord, longing after the Lord, and treasuring the Lord. All these speak of the believers' enjoyment of the Lord's worth and of their appreciation of the Lord's distinctiveness. These are all experiences of the Lord by individuals. Now we will turn to the other part of the Lord's promise.</P>
