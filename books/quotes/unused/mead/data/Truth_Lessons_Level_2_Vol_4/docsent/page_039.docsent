   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the Consummation of the Triune God for Us to Be Baptized into the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 28:19 says, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After Christ completed His ministry on earth, went through the process of death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit, He charged the disciples to baptize those who were to become His disciples into the name of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The name is the sum total of the Divine Being, equivalent to His person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To baptize someone into the name of the Triune God is to immerse him into all that the Triune God is, and this is also to immerse him into the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we believe into the Lord Jesus, we are baptized into the Triune God in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now, as baptized ones, we are in an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, whatever the Father is, whatever the Son has, and whatever the Spirit receives become our portion for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Spirit works in us, we become partakers of Him that through Him we can live a heavenly life on earth, share in God's holiness, and enjoy the processed Triune God with all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit is also the fellowship of the Triune God to us, transmitting the Lord with God into us for our full enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit is also the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we act apart from the Spirit, we lose the oneness; if we remain in the life-giving Spirit, we keep the oneness of the Spirit and we also keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit frees us from the letters of the law that we may not be under the bondage of religious regulations, rituals, and traditional doctrines but enjoy full freedom in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also shows us that the veil that closed off the Holy of Holies was split in two by the death of Christ and that the way of the Holy of Holies has been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we must enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, we must enter into our spirit, to draw near to God and enjoy Him as love, light, and every divine thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He also testifies to us that the law of life of the new covenant has been imparted into our spirit, so that we should not walk according to the knowledge of the law of letters but according to the inward consciousness of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is also the means for us to serve God, that we should not boast in the law but boast in Christ, and not have confidence in the flesh but have confidence only in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He rests upon us as the glory when we are reproached, for the glorifying of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He justifies the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the issue of Christ's having become the Spirit to dwell and live in us that God may be manifested in the flesh in the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is also the consummation of the Triune God that we may be baptized into the Divine Trinity, that is, into all that the Triune God is, into the all-inclusive Spirit, that we may have an organic union with the Triune God to enjoy whatever the Father is, whatever the Son has, and whatever the Spirit receives.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>QUESTIONS Briefly state how the Spirit is the fellowship of the Triune God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Briefly explain the significance of the Spirit as the oneness of the Body of Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the difference between the law of life and the law of letters?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Briefly explain why we are still able to rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Briefly give the significance of the Spirit's justifying the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
