<p>For this crucial point we have to read 9:14-18. By studying these verses along with the Life-study Messages, you will get a clear picture of God&rsquo;s selection in His mercy. Romans 9:16 tells us that &ldquo;it is not of the one who wills, nor of the one who runs, but of God, the One who shows mercy.&rdquo; Our concept is that the one who wills will get what he wills to get and that the one who runs will gain what he runs after. If this were the case, then God&rsquo;s selection would be according to our effort and labor. But it is not so. It is altogether of God who shows mercy. We do not need to will or to run, for God has mercy on us. If we do know God&rsquo;s mercy, we will not put our trust in our efforts; neither will we be disappointed by our failure. The hope for our wretched condition is God&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VESSELS OF MERCY<br />
TO HONOR AND UNTO GLORY</h2>
<p>Romans 9:20-24 says that man was made a vessel and that this vessel is a vessel to honor because God is contained in this vessel (2 Cor. 4:7). The contents of the vessel is a Person of high honor, so this container is called a vessel to honor. Eventually, this vessel will be brought into glory. In other words, the contents of the vessel will saturate this vessel with Himself who is the glory. When the glory saturates the entire vessel, the vessel will be in glory, so it is unto glory. Being vessels to honor is not the result of our choice; it originates with God&rsquo;s sovereignty. It is of God&rsquo;s sovereignty that He makes His glory known by creating vessels of mercy to contain Himself. According to His sovereign authority, God before prepared us unto glory. We were predestinated by His sovereignty to be His containers, vessels to honor to express what He is in glory. That is not only a matter of His mercy, but also of His sovereignty.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE RICHES OF THE LORD<br />
BY CALLING ON HIS NAME</h2>
<p>Romans 10:12 and 13 say, &ldquo;For there is no difference between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him. For, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; To be saved here means to be brought into the enjoyment of the riches of the Lord. The Lord is rich both to the Jews and to the Greeks. He is the rich Lord of all the peoples who call on His name. When we call &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we are calling upon the Lord because His name is His Person. This kind of enjoyment is the filling up of the vessel in Romans 9. The vessel in chapter nine can only be filled up with the riches of the Lord by our calling on Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GRAFTED LIFE</h2>
<p>Romans 11:17 says, &ldquo;But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and became a fellow partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive tree.&rdquo; Romans 9, 10, and 11 are on God&rsquo;s selection by His mercy and these three chapters show us that the olive tree refers to God&rsquo;s chosen people, the real children of Israel, not in the physical sense, but in the spiritual sense. Romans 9:6 says that &ldquo;not all are Israel who are out of Israel.&rdquo; The children of the flesh are not the children of God but the children of the promise (9:8). Therefore, the olive tree refers to the genuine people of God&rsquo;s selection. This tree includes us because we all have been grafted into this tree, of which Christ is the root. The wild branches are grafted into this cultivated olive tree to partake of Christ as the root of this tree.</p>
<p>Romans 11:17 refers to the root of the fatness of the olive tree. The fatness refers to the riches of this tree. Christ is the root of the riches of this cultivated olive tree which is somewhat like the vine in John 15. The vine is the divine organism for God to dispense Himself into His chosen people. In John 15, though, we cannot see the grafting. The fact that we Gentiles were grafted into the divine organism of the Triune God is revealed in Romans 11. We were branches of the wild olive tree, which means that we were born in Adam. But we were transferred into Christ by being grafted into Christ. Therefore, we become the cultivated olive tree, which is somewhat like the grapevine in John 15. Now we are enjoying Christ as the fatness, the riches, of this divine organism for God to dispense Himself into our being. Studying the Life-study Messages of Romans and some of the Life-study Messages related to John 15 will help you get into this crucial point of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; TRIPARTITE BEING<br />
FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Nearly every teacher of the book of Romans knows that chapter twelve is on the practice of the Body of Christ. In order to practice the Body of Christ we first have to consecrate our body (v. 1). Second, we have to be renewed in our mind, which means that our soul has to be renewed (v. 2). Finally, our spirit has to be on fire (v. 11). The three parts of our being all need to be exercised for the practice of the Body of Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 06: The Crucial Points of Truth in Paul's Epistles &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
