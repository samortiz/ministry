   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SOURCE OF LIFE WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do not say the source of the divine life flowing within us is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to say the source is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some may argue that John saw the throne in the heavens, but we must realize that according to Ephesians 2:6 we are now seated together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The source is in us because the source is in the heavens, and we are in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God is in the heavens and we are in the heavens, so God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some may feel, however, that though God and we are in the heavens, that we are in the heavens separately.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not forget, however, that when we believed, we believed into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were also baptized into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and the name denotes the Person Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We were baptized into the Person of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, so after being baptized we are in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God and we are in the heavens, but also we are in Him and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We and God are coinhering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should enjoy this wonderful coinherence with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Jews only believe God, but we believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The difference between the Jews believing and our believing depends on the small preposition in. We believe in God and actually in Greek the preposition for in is into.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We believe into God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we believed into the Triune God and at the same time the Triune God came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no way to demonstrate the fact that we are in God and God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not on this earth, but we are in the heavens, on the one hand, and in God, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This very God who is in us is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The throne of God and of the Lamb should be the center of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the meeting we may say the throne is in us, but many times when the sisters go shopping, the throne is thrown away to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The brothers also need to ask themselves if they have the throne of God in them in doing business.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who is our Lord, Head, and authority in our daily life?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times even in small things such as buying a tie or a pair of shoes, we would not let the throne in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must realize that whenever the throne is gone, there is no source of the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why many times we have the feeling that we are dry and even dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is not the flow of the living water because we do not accept or recognize the lordship, the headship, and the authority of the Triune God in the very center of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why the throne is the last item revealed concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without the throne, the New Jerusalem does not have a center, and without the throne, there is no flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, the entire New Jerusalem would be dried up and even starved to death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The water of life flows out of the throne, and the tree of life grows in the water of life and on the two sides of the river of the water of life as a vine producing timely fruits for the food of God s redeemed for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Both the water of life and the tree of life are the issue of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there is no throne in you what would be the issue?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many Christians are dried up, starved to death, and there is no growth in life because the throne is put away to the heavens and is not in their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The tree of life also has leaves for the healing of the nations, symbolizing the deeds of Christ guiding and regulating the nations outwardly that they may live the human life forever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that when we enjoy Christ as the tree of life, the unbelievers are regulated by our conduct, which we live out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every single saint is a little New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Within you in the center of your being there should be the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever you would take the Triune God as your Head, that will be the time when something begins to flow in your being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to apply this to our daily life in every instance and in every small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even in our talk to our children and in our talk to our spouse, we have to practice submitting ourselves to the inner throne.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not look into the heavens but look to the center of your entire being where there should be a throne.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The throne should be prevailing in the center of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then the water of life will be proceeding out of the throne to supply you and to bring to you the tree of life which nourishes you all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>OUR DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A LIFE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our daily life must be a life of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In that day when we arrive at the ultimate consummation of the divine revelation, we should not be surprised because today we are experiencing the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What will be in the New Jerusalem will be an intensification and a consummation of our present experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are now experiencing the same thing day by day in our family life, in our marriage life, in our school life, in our business life, and in our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are experiencing the throne of God and of the Lamb out of which flows the Triune God for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The water of life, the flow of the Spirit of life, is the divine life in resurrection for the drink of God s redeemed Rev 22:17b; John 7:38-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This river of water of life proceeding out of the throne is bright as crystal with no dimness or opaqueness, purifying God s redeemed and making them transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the last forty years of my ministry, I have not had a heart to speak concerning anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What burdens me in my ministry is to tell people that the Triune God is flowing Himself into their being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have spoken this one thing from many directions and with many messages.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The last pages of the New Testament are on the throne, out of which flows the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The river flows with the God who purposed, with the Lamb who redeemed, and with the Spirit who is now the all-inclusive, processed, triune, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do not want to merely teach you concerning the throne in Revelation 22, but I believe that while you are reading this chapter, the throne of God and of the Lamb, out of which the Triune God flows, is being spoken into you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Triune God is now flowing into you as the water of life with the tree of life growing in it.</S>
