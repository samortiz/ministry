   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE LIFE WITHIN BECOMING THE LIVING WITHOUT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Weigh asked: What is the relationship between spiritual knowledge and our practical living?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's Unique Goal Being to Work</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Himself into Man</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Lee answered: Every saved person should be very clear that he has God's life within him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Spiritual reality is nothing other than the inward life becoming the outward living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must have the basic understanding that God has only one goal, which is to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The significance of salvation is that God has entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not merely the forgiveness of sins or deliverance from hell, but the entrance of God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we say that we have received life into us, it means that God has entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are clear concerning this point, the rest will be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has put Himself into you in the same way that electricity has been transmitted into the light bulb and has become the shining of the bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Obeying the Operation of God Within</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is living and omnipotent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is living now.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may not be very impressed by this word, because, although He may be living, to you He may be sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Bible, there is a difference between "living" and "being."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To "live" is active; the Lord is not merely "being" in you, but He is "living" in you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is moving and working, and He is very purposeful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since the day you were saved, God has been living within you John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What you have to do now is to go along with this moving within.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose a person easily loses his temper with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the time he is saved, he may not know that God is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Right after he is saved, when he comes home from the meeting, his wife may provoke him again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At that instant, he would surely have a certain feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If he goes along with that feeling, he will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if he does not go along with that feeling and instead loses his temper, he will feel depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The next time, when a similar incident occurs, he will not dare to go against that feeling again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The matter of going along with one's inner feeling may be a small thing, but it is difficult to find one person in a thousand who knows to obey it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There were two people who were always at odds with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Both of them were Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day, both came to me and asked for advice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I turned the question back to them and asked them if they knew what the problem was.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They said that they seemed to know, yet they were not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the past, when I encountered such problems, I would try my best to answer them and to list the answers one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I would even open up the Bible and explain to others with it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, the ones that asked the questions knew the answers already.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In recent years, I do not do this kind of thing any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When others ask me a number of questions, I would only answer, "What is your feeling within?"</S>
