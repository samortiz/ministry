[1]  Today, I believe that God wants me to give a message on how to know ourselves.
[2]  If we do not know ourselves, we will not only be self-confident and self-approving, but we will also be full of self-content, thinking marvelously of ourselves and being full of a pride that is most displeasing to God.
[3]  Not only is there no teaching in the Bible concerning self-examination and not only do our experiences tell us that we are incapable of examining ourselves, but also there is even great harm to our spiritual living if we examine ourselves.
[4]  Do we mean to say that we can be careless about our daily life and need not ask whether our walk is right or wrong, or whether our intention is pure or impure?
[5]  Our understanding is that the Bible does not teach us of self-examination, but we have not read that the Bible forbids us from knowing our self.
[6]  Although God does not want us to examine ourselves, He wants us to know ourselves because the coming of the Holy Spirit causes man to reprove himself of his sin.
[7]  How then can we know God's view concerning us?
[8]  Therefore, "in Your light we see light" means that when we receive the revelation of God, the shining of God's holy light, we are able to know the real situation of a certain matter.
[9]  Perhaps we thought that we were better than everyone else, but when the light of God shines upon us, we see not only that sin is sin, but also many things which we considered to be good will be manifested to be sins.
[10]  If, however, your view about yourself is not as sober as the Bible's, if you do not feel that your flesh is as corrupted as the Bible says, and if you do not believe that you are as weak and despicable as the Bible says, then this proves that you have not received the light of God.
[11]  It is very hard for many sinners to confess that they are sinners before they are saved.
[12]  They will know how sinful and how wicked they are only when the light of God comes.
[13]  The self-reproof produced by the light of God will cause them to feel that there is no hiding place.
[14]  Only the light of God can cause man to see the picture of his true self as God sees him.
[15]  Many times we think that we are doing the will of God wholeheartedly and that we are not seeking after anything for ourselves; but, when the light of God shines, we realize that we are not obeying the will of God.
[16]  Not only will our goodness be manifested under God's light to not be good, but even what we normally consider as not good will be brought under God's light to a point where we further realize the extent of its not being good.
[17]  Oftentimes we know very well that we are weak in certain points.
[18]  If we have received light from God, we must then guard what we have received through the Holy Spirit who gave us the light, and we must make it the lasting light to our path, not letting it lose its power.
[19]  By this we see the absolute standard of God, so that we see ourselves, know our own real condition, and realize how we fall short of the standard of God.
[20]  The power of this light is the self-knowledge it renders to man.
[21]  The progress of the Christian life is due to receiving the light of God, which opens a Christian's eyes and causes him to know the riches of the glory of God, and the greatness of the power of God that is given to him through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[22]  This disciple whom the Lord loved was closer to the Lord than the others during the time when the Lord hid His glory in His flesh.
[23]  After the Lord's resurrection, he did good works for the Lord for several decades, and the Lord especially used him to write an epistle which specifically talks about fellowship and particularly about the love of God and the light of God.
[24]  Yet recall that on the island of Patmos he described the Lord Jesus revealing His glory with the words, "His face shone as the sun shines in its power" Rev 1:16 ; and when he saw Him, he "fell at His feet as dead" v. 17 . There is no one who has seen the light of God who will not fall to the ground.
[25]  In the fulfilling of all our responsibilities there is always corruption mixed within it; therefore, after our repentance, if Jesus Christ would only receive us according to our deeds; then our deeds would surely condemn us because we cannot offer a prayer which is as perfect as that required by the moral law of God.
[26]  Oh that the things that were seen and heard in this extraordinary person, his holiness, heavenliness, labor, and self-denial in life, his so remarkably devoting himself and his all, in heart and practice, to the glory of God, and the wonderful frame of mind manifested, in so steadfast a manner, under the expectation of death, and the pains and agonies that brought it on, may excite in us all a due sense of the greatness of the work we have to do in the world, the excellency and amiableness of thorough religion in experience and practice, and the blessedness of the end of such.
[27]  We know that we Christians have to stand before the judgment seat of Christ in the future and be judged.
[28]  No matter what we say, how we feel, what we believe, or what we think, if our walk is not really of the will of God today, then in that day we will surely suffer loss.
[29]  Today if we do not have the light of God to reveal our real condition and to tell us whether or not a matter fits His will, then in that day when God will judge through His light and according to His will, we will surely be unable to stand.
[30]  Therefore, if we want to know whether or not our work can stand in the light of God in that day, then we must ask whether or not our work today is done according to the light of God.
[31]  When we say that we are now walking according to the light of God, we mean that we are walking according to the judgment of God and that we have a clear vision of how God will judge our daily walk in the future.
[32]  If we know ourselves through the light of God and walk according to the knowledge of His will through the light of God, then we know ourselves through the light before the judgment seat and walk according to the knowledge of His will through the light before the judgment seat.
