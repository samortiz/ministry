THE TESTIMONY OF THE BELIEVERS<br>WITH THE CHURCH BY THEIR LIVING</H2><P>Now we want to see the objective testimony of the believers with the church by their living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Concerning Jesus' Person&#151;God and Man</H2><P>This living testimony concerns Jesus' person. He is the God-man (Phil. 2:6-7). He is not only God but also man. In the whole universe, the real God is Christ, and the real man is Christ. He is the complete God and the perfect man. In yourself you are a low man. In Christ you are a high man. In ourselves, we are living in the "basement," but in Christ we are living on the "top floor." When we live in Christ, we are uplifted to be the highest men. We need to live in Christ, the God-man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Concerning Jesus' Life&#151;Two Lives Living Together</H2><P>The testimony of the believers with the church by their living is concerning Jesus' life&#151;two lives living together: the divine life as the inward reality and the human life as the outward expression (1 Tim. 3:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Concerning Jesus' Living</H2><P>We have a life within and a living without. Christ had a life, and then He lived that life. That was His living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Living a Crucified Life in Resurrection</H2><P>Jesus lived a crucified life in resurrection (Phil. 2:8; Acts 2:23-24). Even before He was actually crucified and resurrected, He lived such a life. Today we also need to allow Christ to live a crucified life in resurrection within us and through us. Paul said in Galatians 2:20a, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." To live such a life by ourselves is impossible. We have to live a crucified life in the resurrection of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>1993 Blending Conference Messages concerning the Lord's Recovery and Our Present Need &nbsp; pg 53</div><br></body></html>
