<h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION OF THE CHRISTIAN ASSEMBLY<br />IN JIXINCHUN<br />(Compiled in August 1948)</h2><p>History: In the fall of 1941, Fan Chi-hung of Nansha, Xiaoshan, Chekiang, came to this area to purchase undeveloped land. In the winter of the same year, some of the brothers and pioneers came to develop the area. They built straw shelters on the land they purchased and established a new village&mdash;Ji (Christ) xin (Faith) Chun (village). The meetings began at that time. In the winter of the next year, they built a straw building for the meetings and established the meeting hall.</p><p>Name: The Christian Assembly in Jixin Village</p><p>Address: Jixin Farm, Yangshuchiao, Yiyang, Kiangsi</p><p>Began meeting: November 1941</p><p>Began remembering the Lord: April 1947 (We still have not formally established the Lord's table.)</p><p>Native origin: Shaoshing and Xiaoshan, Chekiang</p><p>Occupation: Farmers</p><p>Present number: Males: 69; Females: 54</p><p>Number in the meetings: Males: 44; Females: 33</p><p>Present number in the table meetings: Males: 16;</p><p> Females: 16</p><p>Names of leading brothers: Hsu Xiu-gen, Chou Yuan-lung, He Chai-gen</p><p>Neighboring denominations: In Yiyang&mdash;China Inland Mission; in Zhaobin&mdash;China Inland Mission outpost (fifteen li from our village) has already stopped.</p><p>Nearby transportation: Fifteen li from the Yiyang Station of the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railroad; Kiangsi-Chekiang Highway is on the eastern side (passing through Yangshuchiao); two li from a river port on the west.</p><p>Education: We began a night school in the spring of this year (two hours every night). On Mondays we teach the Bible, on Tuesdays we teach hymn-singing, on Thursdays we teach from the cooperative text and the popular lessons. We teach the rest of the classes on Friday, Saturday, and the Lord's Day.</p><p>Notes: Our numbers include all men and women both young and old. Locally there are thirty-two households registered. Ninety percent of the population has a native origin of Nansha. Because there is a prayer meeting on Wednesday night, we do not have classes. There is a prayer meeting that begins at 3:00 p.m. on Friday afternoons.</p><ol class="bullet"><li><a class="text" target="_blank" href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/cw-55/map3.pdf">Transportation Lines to Jixin Village</a></li></ol>
