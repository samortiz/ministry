   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to read several verses in Leviticus in this regard Lev 23:2, 5, 6, 24, 27, 34, 39, 41 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These verses tell us that every year in the first month the people had a feast.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of these seven feasts were held according to the months.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without a time for growing, you could never have a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there is no growth, what are you going to feast on?</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we don't have the church, we lack the element of the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Very few Christians have the feast because they don't have the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They don't have the full enjoyment of Christ as a feast because they don't have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need the church to appoint the seasons for growing and feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Numbers 28:11 speaks regarding the new moon, and Numbers 29:6 says something about the month.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the situation today.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They have no seasons: no spring, no fall, no summer, and no winter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In a sense, every day is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, they have no way to grow and they don't have a feast all because they are short of the fourth-day lights.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, once we are in the proper church life, the church will appoint the months, the months will bring in the seasons, and the seasons will give us the feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We will have all the feasts.</S>
