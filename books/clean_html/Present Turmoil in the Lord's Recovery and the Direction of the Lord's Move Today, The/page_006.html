<h2 class="head2">Through the Proper and<br />
Common Fellowship of the Body</h2>
<p>The proper way to take care of the problems in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is through the proper and common fellowship of the Body. We should have a common fellowship, not the fellowship of a small nucleus or small circle. This kind of fellowship should be in love. If we are short of love, we are disqualified. The proper and common fellowship of the Body is without any private circle, without any party spirit, and without any hidden secrecies. Many of these negative items have been practiced by those in the center of the present turmoil. They came together in small, private circles to plan, plot, and conspire. They even proposed secret conferences to several brothers.</p>
<p>In Acts 15 a proper, open conference with the leading ones took place in Jerusalem to consider the matter of circumcision and the faith. It was a big problem among the churches at Paul&rsquo;s time, but the brothers did nothing secretly, and they did not form parties. Paul and Barnabas went up to Jerusalem in order to have a proper fellowship with the elders and the other apostles (vv. 2-21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Avoiding Any Attempt at Conspiracy</h2>
<p>To take care of the problems in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must avoid any attempt at conspiracy. We must do things face to face, keeping everything in the light. We should do things openly and avoid doing anything behind a person&rsquo;s back. To do something behind a person&rsquo;s back or in a small group by way of conspiracy is absolutely devilish and very evil.</p>
<p>As children of the light (Eph. 5:8), we should keep everything in the light, not doing anything in darkness or in secrecy. We are serving the Lord. Why is there the need to do anything in darkness? We should also condemn any seeking of sympathy. Some today are not only seeking sympathy but also hunting for sympathy. We should also abandon backbiting, evil speaking, and death spreading. Backbiting is cruel, evil speaking is slandering, which is the devil&rsquo;s main work to destroy God&rsquo;s people, and death spreading is to work with Satan, the source of death, to spread the germ of spiritual death to deaden God&rsquo;s people. For keeping the oneness in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must abandon all these devilish evils.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Holding to the Unique Goal</h2>
<p>If we are to take care of the problems in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must hold to the unique goal. Whatever we do should be for the edification of the saints, for the benefit of the churches, for the building up of the Body of Christ, for the keeping of the oneness of the Body, and for the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. These are the crucial points in what we call the central lane. For the saints&rsquo; edification, we have to sacrifice our seekings; for the churches&rsquo; benefit, we have to ignore our interest; for the Body of Christ&rsquo;s building up, we have to give up any kind of personal preference; for the keeping of the oneness of the Body, we have to drop all kinds of personal insistings; and for the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have to forget about our territories. It is only in this way that we can cleave to the unique goal of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">According to the Scriptures</h2>
<p>The way to take care of the problems in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should also be according to the Scriptures without twisting and without any interpretation out of context, without any mixing in of human ideas, without any element of tradition, but with an open and seeking spirit. If we hold such an open and seeking spirit, the problems can be taken care of properly. To avoid twisting the Scriptures, we must be very objective in our realization of any portion of the holy Word. To avoid having any interpretation of the Scriptures that is out of context, we must not be biased in our subjective knowledge or personal feelings. To avoid the mixing in of any human ideas, we must reject our natural thoughts, our natural learning, and our natural doings. And to avoid having any element of tradition, we need to be under the light of the pure revelation of the holy Word. All these will keep us in an open and seeking spirit. Then we can discern and judge things concerning the Lord&rsquo;s recovery according to the Scriptures.</p>
