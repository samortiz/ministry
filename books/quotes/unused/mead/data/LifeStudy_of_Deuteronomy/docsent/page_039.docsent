   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The vision of the New Jerusalem reveals that we should take God as our unique way.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Jerusalem there is just one street, which is of pure gold Rev 21:21 , signifying that the nature of God is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb and flows in the midst of the street Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that God is both our life and our way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We take God as our life, and His life with His nature then becomes the way in which we walk.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today we all should fear God and walk in His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Deuteronomy 10:12 Moses also charged the people to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This word love implies a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For instance, it implies the matter of affection, which is something very tender.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God Himself has set an example of loving by setting His affection on His people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moses refers to this in verses 14 and 15.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to Jehovah your God, the earth and all that is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But on your fathers Jehovah set His affection to love them and to choose their seed after them, that is, you above all the peoples, as it is this day."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we should love God by setting our affection on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 12 Moses speaks of loving and serving God with all our heart and with all our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our heart is linked to our spirit, for our conscience, which is of our spirit, is also a part of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, to love and serve God with all our heart and soul indicates that we love and serve Him also with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, according to 6:5, we are to love Him also with all our might, that is, with our physical strength.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today, if we would serve God by practicing the new way, we need to serve with our spirit and with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To visit people in order to get them saved and baptized and then to care for them afterward requires all our heart, soul, and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 10:13 Moses went on to say, "So that you would keep the commandments of Jehovah and His statutes, which I am commanding you today, for your good."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead of "for your good," we could also say "that you may be blessed."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today we need to keep Christ and the riches of Christ which have been ministered to us so that we may be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moses continued his charge by saying, "Circumcise then the foreskin of your heart, and do not be stiff-necked any longer" v. 16 . Because the children of Israel were a peculiar people to God, His treasure, they were required to cleanse themselves, to circumcise the unclean thing in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 20 Moses says, "You shall fear Jehovah your God; Him shall you serve and to Him shall you hold fast and by His name shall you swear."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today we must hold fast to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In holding fast to Him, we may say, "Lord, I will not let You go.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must live for me."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this verse Moses speaks not only of holding fast to God but also of swearing by His name.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe that for the children of Israel to swear by the Lord's name was to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was the ancient way of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today we all need to hold fast to the Lord Jesus and call on His name.</S>
