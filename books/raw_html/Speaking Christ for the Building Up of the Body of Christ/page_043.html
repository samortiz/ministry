 <h2 class="head1">AVOIDING ANY KIND OF DIVISIVE WORD OR DEED<br />
 IN KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
 WITH A SWEET HARMONY</h2>
<p>Sometimes some of the brothers who were so positive for the new way spoke with a divisive tone. This is unwise and not good. We should avoid and reject anything that would even build up a tendency toward division. Our words and our deeds could be considered by others to be divisive. We must be wise and take care of the oneness of the Body of Christ with a sweet harmony. How can there be harmony between a group of people, when some of them are positive for the scriptural way and some are not? It seems that there is a kind of disharmony that is already existing. But to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ with a sweet harmony depends on us. By our behavior, speaking, and actions we can adjust the situation and recover the harmony. We are brothers with the same faith, and we are in the church life in the same recovery. This is our base for oneness. We are harmonious for the one purpose of having the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to keep the testimony of the oneness of the Body of Christ. We should not expect that we can all be the same in everything. Therefore, we should not try to unify the situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENDEAVORING TO FUNCTION IN ALL THE MEETINGS<br />
OF THE LOCAL CHURCH IN YOUR LOCALITY<br />
ACCORDING TO THE FLOW OF THE PRESENT PRACTICE<br />
OF YOUR LOCAL CHURCH</h2>
<p>Some of the younger saints may have been trained in the new way, but when they returned to a church that did not practice the new way, they would not function. They attended the church meetings in a cold way. This is wrong. As long as you attend a certain meeting, you have to go along with the practice of that meeting. You must endeavor to function, not according to your preference but according to the present flow in the meeting. Go on with the saints to show them that you are really one with the Lord&rsquo;s Body in your locality. As long as what is going on is not idolatrous, divisive, or sinful, you must endeavor to function in all the meetings of the local church in your locality according to the flow of the present practice of your local church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING PREVAILING PRAYERS FOR<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S NEW MOVE AND FOR ALL<br />
THE CHURCHES WITH ALL THE SAINTS TO BE GRACED<br />
WITH THE HEAVENLY VISION<br />
AND THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We need to exercise prevailing prayers for the Lord&rsquo;s new move and for all the churches with all the saints to be graced with the heavenly vision and the bountiful supply of the Spirit. We must realize that there is an old traditional way of meeting and serving existing on this earth among the Lord&rsquo;s children. We have already pointed out that it is hard to change something habitual. It would be hard for someone who is used to eating with a fork to switch to eating with chopsticks. The traditional way of meeting and serving is nearly a two thousand-year-old habit. If we try to change this habit in an unwise and quick way, we will stir up much unhappiness. The old way has been built up in Christianity for centuries, and we have it with us to some extent in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We have to expect that some will feel unhappy when we want to take away the old way and replace it with the new way. Thus, we have to pray for ourselves and for all the saints that we may see the heavenly vision.</p>
<p>When I decided to make this turn in 1984 to bring in the new way, I realized the hardship that was involved. I also realized that it would be very, very hard to have a new start. When Brother Nee began to fellowship concerning the scriptural way about fifty years ago, we realized then the difficulty involved in carrying it out because of the strong habit built up to meet and to serve in the traditional way. After reconsidering and studying the New Testament, we believe that we have received a vision from the Lord concerning the scriptural way of meeting and serving for the building up of the Body of Christ. Related to the preaching of the gospel in the new way, I would not say that visiting people in their homes is the unique way to preach the gospel, but I have to say that it is the best way, the most prevailing way, the most effective way to bring people to Christ. This vision has burdened me. We have to pray that the Lord would work out something. Whenever the Lord has something to do, He needs His people to cooperate with Him through prayer. We need to pray that all the churches with all the saints would have the heavenly vision and the bountiful supply of the Spirit. Then the saints will join the new way with a heavenly vision by the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING FELLOWSHIP<br />
WITH THE CHURCHES AND THE SAINTS<br />
IN THE CONCERN OF THE LORD&rsquo;S NEW MOVE</h2>
<p>We should not be cut off or kept apart from the churches and the saints. We need to keep fellowship with the churches and the saints in the concern of the Lord&rsquo;s new move. We should have much fellowship with one another. We have to fellowship with the churches in Australia. We need to have some communication with the saints in New Zealand. The church in Chicago publishes a newsletter with testimonies concerning the effectiveness of the Lord&rsquo;s new way. This is very good. One testimony in this newsletter tells of a Catholic priest who some brothers met as they were visiting people in their homes with the gospel. This Catholic priest prayed with the brothers and was baptized. He left Catholicism and is now a good brother meeting with the local church. I hope that many churches could publish something to let the saints in other countries and continents know how the Lord is moving in their localities. This may nourish, support, and contribute some help to all the saints, even to the saints outside of us in the denominations.</p>
