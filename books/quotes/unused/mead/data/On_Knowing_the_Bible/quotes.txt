[1]  The Completion of the Bible The Subject, the Central Thought, and the Sections of the Bible Principles of Interpretation of the Bible
[2]  These lessons are meant to provide only a very simple and brief overview of 1 the Bible, 2 its completion, 3 its subject, central thought, and sections, and 4 the principles for interpreting the Bible.
[3]  This series of lessons is intended to help a person learn to read the Bible, that is, to help him know how to read the Bible.
[4]  Perhaps some brothers and sisters may think that during each lesson we will be studying the Bible itself; but this is not what we will do.
[5]  Instead, we will help the brothers and sisters learn how to read the Bible and how to know the Bible.
[6]  If we were a spirit only, then God would need to give us only His Spirit and not the Bible; however, since we are not a spirit only, He must also give us the Bible.
[7]  TO KNOW THE BIBLE REQUIRING THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT AND THE TRAINING IN THE MIND
[8]  The Spirit and the Bible are two sides of one matter.
[9]  Similarly, in knowing the Bible, there are also two sides.
[10]  Nevertheless, while we need to touch and contact the Bible with the spirit, it is also necessary to have the understanding in the mind.
[11]  We must realize that the reason we want the mind to understand the Bible is so that our spirit can contact and touch its words.
[12]  One thing is sure: it is difficult for our spirit to touch the words in the Bible without the words first passing through the understanding of the mind.
[13]  If we do not understand the words in the Bible, even if we pray for three hours with much inspiration, it will still be impossible for us to understand or be touched when we read the Bible, because its words cannot get through our mind.
[14]  Many people with doctorate degrees and much learning open up the Bible to read it, only to find that, though they know every word, they cannot understand some of the passages because they do not comprehend the background knowledge or the special terms of the Bible.
[15]  The Bible is words, yet it is not man's words, but the words of God.
[16]  The Bible tells us even the universe was created by God's word Heb 11:3 .
[17]  Second Peter 1:21 says that the prophecy in the Bible, that is, the words of the Bible, is spoken "from God, being borne by the Holy Spirit."
[18]  Today, not only do we have to admit that the Bible is God's inspiration, but we must also realize that the Bible is God's Spirit bringing man into God, and is from God, speaking forth God's word.
[19]  The words of the Bible are for the expression and explanation of God Himself.
[20]  If one does not read or understand the Bible, he will not understand or know God.
[21]  The Bible is the breathing out of God, in the same way that my speaking here this morning is the breathing out of myself.
[22]  There is no element of God in any other word, whereas there is the element of God in the word of the Bible.
[23]  For this reason, many times when we read the Bible, not only do we feel the presence of God, but we feel that we contact and touch God within.
[24]  In the same principle, if there were only God the Spirit in the universe and there were no Bible, God to us would be the same as the radio waves; we would not be able to grasp Him or find Him.
[25]  Under normal circumstances, one cannot separate God the Spirit from the Bible, since the Bible is the embodiment and the expression of God the Spirit.
[26]  Today, we will consider how the Bible was completed based on the historical facts.
[27]  In Genesis we see that before the Bible was written, God often appeared to the forefathers and gave them verbal instructions.
[28]  THE AUTHORS OF THE BIBLE AND THE PLACES IN WHICH IT WAS WRITTEN A. The Old Testament
[29]  There is a greater contention about the authorship of the book of Job The things recorded in this book took place before the time of Moses and may have been concurrent with Abraham, which is about two thousand years before Christ.
[30]  Some have said it was written by Elihu, and some have said that Moses was probably the author.
[31]  V. THE RECOGNITION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE BIBLE A. The Old Testament 1.
[32]  The arrangement we now have of the books of the Old Testament was not the original sequence in the Hebrew Old Testament.
[33]  THE APOCRYPHA A. Not Being in the Bible in the Beginning
[34]  There were fourteen books of the Apocrypha which were not included in the Bible.
[35]  CHAPTER THREE THE SUBJECT, THE CENTRAL THOUGHT, AND THE SECTIONS OF THE BIBLE
[36]  If we want to know any book, we have to grasp its subject and central thought.
[37]  Although there are sixty-six books in the Bible, it has its subject and central thought; there are also distinctive sections within its structure.
[38]  The subject of the Bible is contained in only four sentences: God planned and created, Satan rebelled and damaged, man fell and was lost, and Christ redeemed and built.
[39]  In Christianity there are many books of Bible exposition.
[40]  Most of them say that the central thought of the Bible is Christ.
[41]  But today, according to the light we have received through His mercy, we feel it is insufficient merely to say that Christ is the central thought of the Bible.
[42]  There are many ways to subdivide the Bible into sections.
[43]  1.The four Gospels: There are four books of the Gospel.
[44]  An easy way to memorize the number of books of the Bible is to remember that 3 times 9 equals 27, that is, 39 books in the Old Testament and 27 books in the New.
[45]  In this chapter we need to see some of the principles in interpreting the Bible.
[46]  If we want to study the Bible, we have to understand the Bible.
[47]  In order to understand the Bible, we need to interpret it.
[48]  If there is no interpretation and no explanation, naturally we will have no way to understand the Bible.
[49]  We cannot interpret a sentence, a verse, or a section of the Bible spiritually for the first part and literally for the second part.
[50]  Many Bible expositors have interpreted the water here spiritually as referring to the word of God.
[51]  One brother once said that any single verse in the Bible requires the whole Bible to explain it.
[52]  In interpreting the Bible, one should not be confined by the background, nor should he ignore the background.
[53]  In expounding the Bible, one has to take care of the persons to whom a word is spoken.
[54]  In the Bible, there are at least these three kinds of people to whom God speaks His words: the Jews, the nations, and the church.
