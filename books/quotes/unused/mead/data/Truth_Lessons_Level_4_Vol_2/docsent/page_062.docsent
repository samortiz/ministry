   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SEVEN SEALS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Revelation 4 John saw the scene in heaven after Christ s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He saw the throne of God as the center and God sitting on the throne ready to execute His universal administration for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John saw on the right hand of Him who sits upon the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed up with seven seals 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These seven seals are the contents of the scroll and the contents of the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are a record of God s thought concerning the church, Israel, the world, and the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John also saw that no one in heaven, on earth, or under the earth was worthy to open the scroll or to look into it; hence, he wept much vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While John was weeping, one of the elders said to him, Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so that He may open the scroll and its seven seals v. 5 . Christ s overcoming qualifies Him to open the scroll and its seven seals.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John then saw a Lamb standing as having just been slain v. 6 . Having just been slain indicates that the Lamb was recently slain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that the scene in heaven depicted by John in these verses is immediately after Christ s ascension into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Having passed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ in ascension is qualified to open the mystery of God s economy contained in the seven seals.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. The First Four Seals</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first four seals consist of four horses with their riders 6:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All four riders are personified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The rider of the first horse, the white horse, is the gospel v. 2 ; the rider of the second horse, the red horse, is war v. 4 ; the rider of the third horse, the black horse, is famine v. 5 ; and the rider of the fourth horse, the pale horse, is death v. 8 . Immediately after Christ s ascension, beginning from the first century the gospel has been spreading for twenty centuries, and war has been proceeding simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>War always causes famine, and famine issues in death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These four things will continue to run until the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Rider of the White Horse</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The rider of the white horse is the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>White signifies clean, pure, just, and approvable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The white horse is a symbol of the preaching of the gospel, which is clean, pure, just, and approvable both by men and by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John saw a white horse, and he who sits on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer v. 2 . The rider had a bow without an arrow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that the arrow has already been shot to destroy the enemy, and the victory has been won for the constitution of the gospel of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fighting is over, and the gospel of peace is proclaimed in a peaceful way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Throughout all the centuries, wherever the gospel is proclaimed, it has conquered and has overcome all kinds of opposition and attack.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gospel is still conquering today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Rider of the Red Horse</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verses 3 and 4 say, When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And I saw, and behold, another horse, a red one, went forth; and to him who sits on it, to him authority was given to take peace from the earth, and that men should slay one another; and to him a great sword was given.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this verse red signifies the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the red horse is a symbol of the raging of war, which is altogether a matter of shedding blood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To take peace from the earth, that men should slay one another, and to him a great sword was given clearly indicate war.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These are prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since Christ s ascension, the preaching of the gospel has been followed by war.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Rider of the Black Horse</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verses 5 and 6 say, When He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he who sits on it had a balance in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying: A choenix of wheat for a denarius and three choenixes of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Black, indicating dearth Jer 14:1-4 , signifies the color of the visage of famished people Lam 4:8-9; 5:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The black horse is a symbol of the spreading of famine, which causes a black visage.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A balance is a scale used to weigh precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, in Revelation 6:5-6 it is used to weigh food, showing the scarcity of food Lev 26:26; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During times of famine, oil and wine are always short and become precious.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Famine always follows war, and war causes food to be scarce.</S>
