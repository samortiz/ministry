   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That He who made all nations is not willing</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One soul should perish, lost in shades of night.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Behold how many thousands still are lying,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Bound in the darksome prison-house of sin,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With none to tell them of the Savior's dying</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Or of the life He died for them to win.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>'Tis yours to save from peril of perdition</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The soul for whom the Lord His life laid down;</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Beware lest, slothful to fulfill our mission,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You lose one jewel that should deck His crown.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That God, in whom they move and live, is love;</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Tell how He stooped to save His lost creation,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And died on earth that men He might approve.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Give of your sons to bear the message glorious;</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Give of your wealth to speed them on their way;</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Pour out your soul for them in prayer victorious,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And all you spend our Savior will repay.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He comes again; O brothers, ere you meet Him,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Make known to every heart His saving grace;</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through your neglect unfit to see His face.</S>
