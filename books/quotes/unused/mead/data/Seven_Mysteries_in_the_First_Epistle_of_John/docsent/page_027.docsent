   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT TOUCHED BY THE WICKED ONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Fourthly, Satan cannot touch such a church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is out to make gain, but he finds out that whenever he touches that church, he suffers a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even if he is invited, he will stay away!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First John 5:18 concludes, "That wicked one toucheth him not."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the only verse in the Bible which contains such a declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our fallen concept is that Satan will always bother us, that he is too much for us, and that we cannot overcome him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must pay attention to what this verse says.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a poker is heated white-hot in a fire, no one dares to touch it for fear of being burned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, on this earth, the church can be that threatening to Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even in an evil city like New York there can be a church that the wicked one touches not.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He will tell his demons to stay away, lest they get burned because the fire is so hot.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What a glory to the Lord and what a shame to Satan when a church is so on fire!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If in our prayer meetings we pitifully beg the Lord to deal with our enemy, we are short of life, short of these seven mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are filled up with them, Satan will stay away to avoid disaster.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>V. NOT HAVING IDOLS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Children, keep yourselves from idols" are the closing words of 1 John 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It seems like a strange conclusion, after the mention of the wonderful matters of life, fellowship, abiding, the anointing, the divine birth, the divine seed, and the water, the blood, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What are the idols?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Notice the previous verse.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the true God, and eternal life" v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Idols, we can see from the context, are whatever is not the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is the true God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the Triune God experienced by us as our life in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This life is a seed within, a life that overcomes the world and that Satan dares not touch.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This life is in us and is the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you say that the God you worship is in the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The God in 1 John is in us as our life, overcoming sin, the world, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This very life is the true God; whatever is not this true God in our experience is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose, for example, the life within you says you should get your hair cut.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You cannot bear to go along, and beg the Lord to tolerate your hair the way it is for a while longer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To do this is to have an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The same may be true in regard to your shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you bring home something from your shopping that the Lord has said no about, you are bringing home an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It might even be a leather, gilt-edged Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the Lord within you says no, yet you insist upon buying it, even this Bible has become an idol to you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever is against this inner life, in His eyes is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our God today is not only the Creator, living in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has come through water, blood, and Spirit and is now the seed, living within you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the true God and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Anything other than this is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Children, keep yourselves from idols.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To have an idol there is no need for you to go to a heathen temple.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whatever you take when He has said no is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>An idol in principle is anything that substitutes for God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The true God is simply eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Anything which takes the place of this life is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>REJECTING ANTICHRISTS</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The sixth issue of the mysteries is found in 2 John 9: "Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word transgresseth is more accurately rendered "goes forth" or "goes too far."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What does it mean to go too far and not abide in the doctrine of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The doctrine of Christ is that Christ, the Son of God, was incarnated and, after thirty-three and a half years of living on this earth, was crucified in our stead, shedding His blood to redeem us; He was buried and arose from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit; today we have His blood and His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those who have gone too far and do not abide in this doctrine do not believe that Christ is the Son of God; that He came as a man for our redemption; that He shed His blood for our sins; and that He rose from the dead to impart Himself as life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What they teach is that Christ is simply a man who lived a good life and set us an example to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Notice how the Apostle John says such people should be treated: "Receive him not into your house, neither bid him God-speed: For he that biddeth him God-speed is partaker of his evil deeds" 2 John 10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>People like this are the ones John calls antichrists.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They may call themselves Christian and consider themselves part of Christianity, but they deny Christ's deity, His redemption, His resurrection, and even His virgin birth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They are actually blaspheming Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this category of those who have gone too far and are not abiding in the doctrine of Christ are Jehovah's Witnesses, the Mormons, and the modernists.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All these are antichrists.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the church practices these seven mysteries, it will not tolerate such people.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There will be a clear line drawn, because the church will recognize that these have no anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The living Body cannot take the presence of corpses, anymore than we would be able to sleep in a room where there was a dead body!</S>
