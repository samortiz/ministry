   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SEVEN THE BELIEVERS THEIR PRESENT 11</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we saw that the believers have been redeemed by being bought and by being forgiven of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall see that the believers have been redeemed by being freed, washed, and sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By Being Freed Released</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be freed is to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has forgiven us and has released us, for forgiveness involves releasing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever a person is forgiven he is also released.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our God has forgiven us, and this means that He has also released us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1 From God s Judgment Condemnation</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, we have been released from God s judgment, that is, from His condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John 3:18 says, He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because all people are sinful, they all are condemned before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is righteous, and He cannot reckon those who have sinned as being without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As sinners, descendants of Adam, we have already been judged and thus are under God s condemnation and even His sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have been sentenced to eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when God forgave us, He released us from His judgment and sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because God loves mankind, He laid our sins on His Son, who died on the cross as our substitute to be judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now those who believe in Christ are released from God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But those who do not believe in Him remain under God s condemnation and can only wait for eternal judgment and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all were condemned in Adam through his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that we were judged at the same time Adam was judged.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, we were judged, condemned, before we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since we are a part of Adam, we were judged when Adam was judged.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No matter whether we are good or evil, we all, as a part of Adam, were under God s judgment before we believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But God did not send the Son into the world that He might judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him John 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here we see that Christ, the Son of God, was sent to save us from God s condemnation, which was brought in by the sin of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although we were condemned in Adam, we have been freed from this condemnation through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2 Out of the Curse of the Law</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As redeemed ones, we have also been released out of the curse of the law Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is merciful, but He is still just and has His law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The entire human race, however, is against His law and is breaking it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the sinning race of mankind is under a curse, the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason there are so many calamities, tragedies, and sicknesses, all of which are an indication that mankind is under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But God is full of mercy, and He gives people a chance to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we repented and were forgiven by God, we were released from the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As descendants of Adam, all sinners are under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Romans 5 we see that Adam brought us all under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the curse was not made official until the law was given.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now the law declares that all the fallen descendants of Adam are under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whereas the law condemns us and makes the curse official, Christ through His crucifixion has redeemed us out of the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, Cursed is every one hanging on a tree Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the curse that came in through Adam s fall has been dealt with by Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The origin of the curse is man s sin Gen 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The curse is carried out through the law, for the law administers the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the curse is related to the law of God; it is the demand of the righteous God upon sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When Christ bore our sins, He also took our curse.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because Christ was cursed in our place, the demand of the law was fulfilled, and He could redeem us from the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now, as believers, we are freed from the curse of the law.</S>
