   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Esau and Jacob had the same parents; they were twins born of their father, Isaac, who was chosen by God, and of their mother, Rebekah, who was selected by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All that Esau and Jacob were and did are models and symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I. ESAU A. Symbolizing the Natural Man</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Esau was born the oldest son; hence, he was the first.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Bible, the first, in the present sense, refers to that which is natural, of the old creation, and forsaken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, the Bible calls Adam the first man 1 Cor 15:45, 47 , indicating that he was natural and earthy, and that the earthy aspect of his being was rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In another example, the firstborn sons of the Egyptians were smitten by God Exo 12:12-13 , signifying again that the first is forsaken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Esau, born the oldest son and being the first, symbolizes the natural man, who is hated by God Rom 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. Symbolizing the Preference</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>of the Natural Man</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; hence, he was the one most loved by his father according to the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Isaac loved Esau because he often ate of Esau s venison Gen 25:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Isaac was old, he still asked Esau to go hunting and make him savory meat, which he loved, so that he could bless Esau before he died Gen 27:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaac s love for Esau was altogether in the natural man and according to the natural taste.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that what the natural man does by his natural strength typified by Esau s hunting is the preference of one who lives in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. Despising and Losing the Birthright</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although Esau was the firstborn, he despised the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day while Jacob was making pottage, Esau came from the field, and, feeling faint, he asked Jacob to give him some red pottage.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, Jacob demanded that Esau sell him his birthright before he would give him the red pottage.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then he swore to Jacob and sold his birthright to Jacob Gen 25:29-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Esau lusted after the enjoyment in the flesh, after the world and its worldly pleasures, and for a morsel of meat he sold his own birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing of his father, Isaac, he was rejected, though he earnestly sought it with loud weeping; for he had no ground, no way, to reverse by repentance the result of what he had done Gen 27:30-38; Heb 12:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus Esau despised and lost his birthright.</S>
