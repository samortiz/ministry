<div class='line'><b>1</b> Jesus Himself drew near,</div>
<div class='line'>And joined them as they walked,</div>
<div class='line'>And soon their hearts began to burn,</div>
<div class='line'>As of Himself He talked:</div>
<div class='line'>Draw near, O Lord.</div>

<div class='line'><b>2</b> Jesus Himself drew near,</div>
<div class='line'>They were no longer sad;</div>
<div class='line'>When He was walking at their side,</div>
<div class='line'>How could they but be glad?</div>
<div class='line'>Draw near, O Lord.</div>

<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> Jesus Himself drew near,</div>
<div class='line'>And all their doubts were solved;</div>
<div class='line'>He showed them why Christ came to die,</div>
<div class='line'>And what that death involved:</div>
<div class='line'>Draw near, O Lord.</div>

<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> Jesus Himself drew near,</div>
<div class='line'>And at the journey's end</div>
<div class='line'>They could not let Him leave them thus,</div>
<div class='line'>The Stranger was their Friend:</div>
<div class='line'>Draw near, O Lord.</div>
