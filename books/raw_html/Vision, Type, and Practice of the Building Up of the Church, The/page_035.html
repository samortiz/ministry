        <h2 class="head1">GENUINE BUILDING BEGINNING IN THE HOLY PLACE</h2>
<p>Thus far, we have seen bronze and silver in the tabernacle, but we have not yet seen gold, which signifies God&rsquo;s substance, His divine nature. Hence, there has not yet been genuine building. There must be gold in God&rsquo;s building. The building materials must be made of wood overlaid with gold, which signifies man mingled with God. A brother may be genuinely saved and experience the cross, typified by the bronze altar, and the Holy Spirit, typified by the laver. This brother may have been judged and be forgiven by God and be experiencing the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work on the cross. He may also know his real condition from being under the shining of the Holy Spirit and also know the washing of the Holy Spirit. By the renewing of the Holy Spirit, this brother is delivered from filth and weaknesses. Hence, he is white, righteous, and blameless not only before God but also before men; he manifests the condition of fine white linen. Nevertheless, this brother may not be able to be built up. Building up requires gold, which signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature.</p>
<p>If our experience in the outer court makes us proud, that pride will become a veil that stops us from entering into the Holy Place. However, if we are neither complacent nor proud but continue pursuing, the Holy Spirit will open our eyes to see that what we experience in the outer court is a preparation for building; it is not the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God. What is most valuable and precious before God is not the righteousness of the outer court but the inner Christ. Hence, the Holy Spirit will lead us to experience the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar in the Holy Place, which typify the indwelling Christ as the bread of life, the light of life, and the acceptable incense before God. These experiences indicate that we have entered into the Holy Place.</p>
<p>On the north side of the Holy Place there was a table of acacia wood overlaid with gold, on which were twelve cakes called the bread of the Presence (Exo. 25:23-30; Lev. 24:5-6). This bread typifies Christ as our bread of life that supplies us daily (John 6:35). This bread is not only in us; it is set before God. This experience is much more precious than being forgiven, washed, and having a righteous and pure outward living.</p>
<p>When we see that Christ indwells us as our life, the Holy Spirit will further show us that this life is the light of men (1:4). Christ as the light of men is typified by the lampstand of pure gold in the Holy Place (Exo. 25:31). The outer court was open and had natural light. It had the light of the sun in the day and the light of the moon and the stars at night. There was no window in the Holy Place, and the entry to the Holy Place was covered by a screen. Hence, natural light from outside could not shine in the Holy Place. There was, therefore, the need of light from the golden lampstand. This light signifies the light of life generated by the indwelling Christ as our life (John 8:12). At the lampstand we not only know the indwelling Christ as our daily bread of life that enables us to live before God; we also know that the life within us is the light that shines within us and makes us bright. At this point we will discover that being a Christian is not just a matter of a good outward living but also of knowing Christ as life inwardly. We must not live according to our natural sight by determining matters according to right and wrong or good and evil. Rather, we must let Christ as our light of life shine and enlighten us with the truth. Thus, we will turn from outward matters to inward matters. There was also an incense altar of acacia wood overlaid with gold in the Holy Place (Exo. 30:1-3; 37:25-26). The incense altar signifies our offering up Christ as incense so that we may be acceptable before God. At this point we are acceptable to God because everything about us is in resurrection, in Christ.</p>
<p>The experiences of the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar are in the Holy Place of the tabernacle and indicate that the tabernacle has been built. The tabernacle was built of boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold and joined by rings of gold (36:34). This indicates that God is mingled with man and that His dwelling place is built when the believers are joined as one in the divine life and nature of God.</p>
<p>The boards were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, and their sockets were of silver (vv. 24, 26, 30). The foundation of the acacia wood overlaid with gold was silver. This signifies that the foundation of the mingling of God and man is redemption. The sockets of the hangings in the outer court were of bronze (38:10-11), but the sockets of the boards of the tabernacle were of silver. In the outer court silver clasps were upon the bronze pillars, indicating that the judgment of Christ on the cross is the foundation of redemption. In the tabernacle, however, the boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold sat upon silver sockets, which indicates that redemption is the foundation for us to know Christ as life and for us to be mingled with God. In other words, redemption is the foundation for experiencing gold overlaying wood.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that concerning the outer court, Exodus 38 mentions first the bronze altar, then the laver, and then the hangings of the court and the bronze sockets (vv. 1-20). The spiritual significance of this order is that our experience of the hangings of the court and the bronze sockets is produced by our experiences of the bronze altar and the laver. In chapters 25 and 26, concerning the Holy Place, the table of the bread of the Presence and the golden lampstand are spoken of before the boards of the tabernacle (25:23-39; 26:15-29). This implies that our experience of the boards is produced by our experiences of the table of the bread of the Presence and of the golden lampstand. In other words, by experiencing Christ as our life supply and as the light of life, we are accepted by God and are mingled with Him, thus becoming building materials that are joined together through the gold rings and built up.</p>
<p>A person can be saved and experience the work of redemption and the washing of the Holy Spirit without being built. The experiences of the bronze altar and the laver are but a preparation for building; they are not the building itself. Building is a matter of God mingling with man. Without the mingling of divinity with humanity, there is no building. The outer court is only the boundary of God&rsquo;s dwelling place. In order to be in God&rsquo;s dwelling place, a person had to enter into the Holy Place. In the Holy Place we experience the Word who became flesh and has entered into us as the Spirit to be our satisfaction of life and our light of life so that we may be accepted by God. Only when we know and experience Christ in the Holy Place can we be mingled with God, that is, divinity mingled with humanity. This is the way that we become boards that can be built up together.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
