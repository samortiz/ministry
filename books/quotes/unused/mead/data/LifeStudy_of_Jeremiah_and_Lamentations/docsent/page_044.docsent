   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Jehovah Saying That War</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Should Be Prepared against Her</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Prepare war against her; / Rise up, and let us go up at noon./...Rise up, and let us go up at night / And destroy her palaces" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In these verses God speaks to the Babylonians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He will use them in His correction of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>C. The Husband Making Her</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>a Desolation and an Uninhabited Land</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Be admonished, O Jerusalem, / Lest My desire for you depart, / Lest I make you a desolation, / An uninhabited land" v. 8 . This indicates that, through the Babylonians, the Husband would make her a desolation and a land that is no longer inhabitable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>D. The Enemy Thoroughly Gleaning</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Her Remnant like a Vine</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The enemy will thoroughly glean her remnant like a vine; they will pass their hand again over her branches like a grape gatherer v. 9 . The houses of Israel will be turned over to others, fields and wives together, and the Husband will stretch out His hand over her inhabitants v. 12 . God will stretch out His hand to chastise them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 9 we have a figure of speech: a vineyard with its grapevines.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to God's law, once the grapes were harvested, no one was allowed to pick the gleanings, for the remnant of the grape harvest was to be for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the Babylonians would harvest the "grapes" from the "vine" of Israel, and then come again to glean the vine thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that they would come more than once to take the people captive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>E. The Husband Now Bringing Evil on Her</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and Now Laying Stumbling Blocks before Her</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Listen, O earth; I am now bringing evil / On this people...</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>/I am now laying before this people stumbling blocks, / And fathers and sons together / Will stumble against them; / A neighbor and his friend will perish" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>19, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, Jehovah would bring evil, calamity, upon Israel; on the other hand, He would set up stumbling blocks before the people in order to stumble them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>F. The Husband's Determination</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>in His Reaction to Her Evils</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This chapter discloses the Husband's determination in His reaction to the wife's evils vv.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Her actions were evil, and God's punishment was His reaction to these evil actions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As I conclude this message, I would like to summarize chapters two through six in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In chapters two through four is Jehovah's major complaint, against His wife's apostasy, spiritual fornication idolatry, by which she broke the first four commandments of the law concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In chapters five and six is Jehovah's minor complaint, against His wife's evil conduct, by which she broke the last five commandments of the law concerning men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Israel broke the first four commandments by worshipping idols and the last five commandments by not executing justice or seeking faithfulness.</S>
