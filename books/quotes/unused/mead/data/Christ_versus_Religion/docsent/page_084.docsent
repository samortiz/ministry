   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE AGE OF THE BOOK OF REVELATION Scripture Reading: Rev 2:1, 7, 8, 11, 12, 17, 18, 29; 3:1a, 6, 7, 13, 14, 22; 14:13b; 22:17a; 5:6; 1:10; 19:10b; 22:6b NO QUOTATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The age of the Book of Revelation is the age of the seven Spirits, and this is the day in which we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hallelujah for the last book of the Bible, the Book of Revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is entirely different from all the other books.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Matthew there are a number of quotations from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John, the Acts, Romans, Hebrews, and other books there are also many quotations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But here in the Book of Revelation, a book of twenty-two chapters, we cannot find one Old Testament quotation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is absolutely a new book; nothing in it is quoted from the old books.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this book there are no quotations from the entire Bible nothing at all of the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then what is here?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The seven Spirits!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is a Lamb with seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We only see the Lamb, the Redeemer, with the intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nothing is of the old source.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the utterances in this book are made by the sevenfold Spirit and are new and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is nothing religious, nothing old, nothing dead; everything is spoken by the living Spirit in a new and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>NO HUMAN SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, we never read in this book of any human utterances!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We always read that it is the Spirit who is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Yea, saith the Spirit" 14:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches" 2:7, etc. . Seven times in chapters 2 and 3 we read that it is the Spirit who is speaking to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The messages here are quite unlike those of the Old Testament prophets who prophesied, "Yea, my people, thus saith the Lord.."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The utterances here are also unlike those in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Epistles say, "This I Paul say" I Cor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>7:6 , or "I Peter exhort" I Pet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>5:1 , etc. Here in the Book of Revelation it never says, "Thus saith the Lord," or "This I say," etc. It says rather, "The Spirit saith, the Spirit saith, the Spirit saith." Have you noticed this same sentence with the same wording repeated seven times: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches"? Why is this sentence repeated seven times? Because of the seven-fold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually the entire book is concluded in this way: "And the Spirit and the bride say.."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We read firstly in this book that the Spirit is speaking to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then eventually the Spirit and the Bride become one they speak together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit and the church in this verse are a compound subject.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The two have been compounded; the two have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is one with the seven Spirits, and the seven Spirits have been fully wrought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is God's goal!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the ultimate consummation of His eternal purpose.</S>
