   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Cross Dealing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with the Passions and the Lusts</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sex is right, and food is right, but both can turn into lust.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This happens when there is an inordinate demand and obsession for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus dealt with these things on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He dealt with our flesh with its passions and lusts Gal 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a great matter, a great gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The cross has dealt with our passions and our lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No Christian should steal or even contemplate stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should be clean not only in our conduct but also in our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although Christians recognize the existence of the flesh, they should be clean in their thoughts and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord has already accomplished this work for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>D. God s Life Being Altogether Positive</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This does not mean that Christians do not need to deal with their lust.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are saying that the Lord has given us a new spirit and a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The new spirit enables us to touch God, and the new life enables us to express His life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s life is altogether positive; there is nothing negative about it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is not a matter of dealing with lust but a matter of seeing something positive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It has to do with the new life and the manifestation of God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a new spirit in us which is able to touch the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christians are filled within with these positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not have to pay attention to such ordinances as do not handle, nor taste, nor touch.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not have to pay attention to the negative things, because we have the positive things with us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must touch more of the positive things, the things in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must keep touching the Spirit of glory and the life in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we have the positive things, abstinence from eating, touching, and handling will become a minor issue.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everyone who is in the Lord should be fully released from these things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people like to subject their physical body to asceticism because they are short of the positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some Christians also have the same inclination.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They would have nothing to cling to if asceticism were taken away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They constantly restrain themselves from seeing, handling, eating, touching, and listening to all kinds of things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you take these ordinances away from them, you will take away their very world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is their heaven and earth, their world, their universe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you take away their universe, their world will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING A FLEXIBLE ONE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible gives a very flexible view concerning such things as eating.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It says one may eat or not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In God s eyes none of these things means anything; they are minor points, not major issues.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All of these things are minor from the Scripture s point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The important and crucial things are the life of the Son of God and the life of Christ within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With such glory and weight upon us, food and clothing become minor issues.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible shows us that the Christian life is a flexible life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is all right for anyone to dress himself moderately and to eat frugally before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if someone gives him more to eat, he should feel free to take the offer; there is nothing wrong with eating more.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you feel that you do not want to marry for the Lord s sake, that is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you feel that you are not doing justice to yourself by remaining single, it is good for you to marry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some do not have as many riches of Christ, and you will be taking their world away from them if you take marriage away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But some have the riches of Christ, and they can go on undeterred.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is good to remain single, and it is good also to marry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These issues become very minor in comparison to that which is great and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Any anxiety over these things shows one s little appreciation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The problems of marriage and food are very minor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whether a Christian eats more or eats less is of minor concern.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These are not the fundamental issues.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The crucial thing for us to do is to express the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the other matters will spontaneously find their proper place if glory is properly expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If Christ s glory is not expressed, minor things will become major things, and we will apply asceticism to them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who do not know the Lord may cherish these things, but those who know the Lord will easily and effortlessly transcend them.</S>
