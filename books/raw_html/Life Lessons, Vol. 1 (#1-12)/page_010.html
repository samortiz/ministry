The first part is called the Old Testament and the second part is called the New Testament.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Old Testament</h2><p>This refers to the first part of the Bible, which is composed of thirty-nine books that are divided into:</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Books of Law</h2><p>These include a total of five books from Genesis to Deuteronomy and are called the books of law because in them are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which form the Law.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Books of History</h2><p>These include a total of twelve books from Joshua to Esther and record the history of the Israelites from their entrance into Canaan to their return from captivity.

The Books of History</h2><p>These include a total of five books from the Gospel of Matthew to the Acts of the Apostles, the first four being a history of the Lord Jesus and the last being the account of the move of the disciples on the earth after the Lord ascended into the heavens.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Epistles</h2><p>These include a total of twenty-one books from the book of Romans to the book of Jude, which are letters written by the apostles to either the churches or individual saints, especially speaking about the church and the proper condition in the spiritual life and living of the church and the saints.</p><h2 class="head3">3.
