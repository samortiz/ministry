   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I left Ch'ang-sha on the fifth of this month and arrived in Kuei-yang on the fifteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I leave for K'un-ming tomorrow morning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I still do not have a companion, but the Lord's grace is sufficient for me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I see His powerful leading and support in all aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I really thank and praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>May the Lord's love be with you always!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Chen Hsi-wen</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>January 15, in Kuei-yang</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From K'un-ming to Yeh-Ji</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Dear Brother Chih-I in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Last night I received your two airmail letters dated November 15 and December 6.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I read them through carefully and was very comforted!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Hu, Brother Ma, and I left K'un-ming on November 14 for Yeh-Ji Village in Wei-Si County Brother Hu's home .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the trip from K'un-ming to Hsia-Guan in Da-Li, we took a three-hour bus ride.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Hsia-Guan we hired pack mules, so we were delayed for four or five days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Hsia-Guan there is a China Inland Mission chapel, and we preached the gospel there a few times.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It took us fourteen or fifteen days to get to Wei-Si from Hsia- Guan and another four days to get from Wei-Si to Yeh-Ji.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We arrived in Yeh-Ji Village on December 7.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's grace enabled us to travel safely even though the roads were treacherous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This area is in the region of tribal aborigines, so everything is inconvenient.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are no houses for rent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Fortunately, Brother Hu has a house here.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must plant our own vegetables to get something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes an aborigine will bring some eggs or meat on his back to sell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Most of the time it is done by bartering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a lack of salt and tea here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The aborigines need them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes they will not take paper money but insist on silver.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is difficult for us evangelists, who do not have a settled home, to live in a place like this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is nothing really, but a greater problem lies before us in that my wife will soon have a baby.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I believe that God will grace us and bring us through!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is an X denominational church here, which is where Brother Hu used to work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Brother Ma and I arrived, the X church was not very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They were especially jealous of Brother Ma because they thought that he was helping Brother Hu financially and because he also came out of the X denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason, one of the X has repeatedly come to speak with Brother Ma to tell him that we should go somewhere else to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank the Lord, there is still the opportunity to preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must not give up any opportunity to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am now learning Tibetan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Hu has some family matters which are not settled, so we have not started on our journey.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After my wife has her baby sometime in January 1938 , Brother Hu, Brother Ma, and I will go to Tibet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have decided to go to Ba-Tang to take a look.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the Lord works and allows me to go, I will move my whole family to Ba-Tang and move from there to the outlying areas.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the Lord gives grace again, I will move into Tibet!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is my recent leading.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The future is in the Lord's hands, so I can only look to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I received the money order for X dollars in your airmail letter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Please do not worry about it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, I must send this money order to K'un-ming before it can be cashed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The post office here can do everything but cash money orders.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, it is not called a post office here but a postal agent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We can receive registered letters, etc., but we must go to the county seat of Wei-Si to receive money.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It takes us three weeks to get from here to K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Regular letters take two months to get here, and airmail letters take one month.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Was Brother Luan's and Sister Miao's trip to Hong Kong and Szechuan interrupted?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Did they come to Yunnan also?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What has been their most recent move?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I think of them often!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Where is Brother Nee now?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Please tell me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If he is still in Hankow, please greet him for me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I really hope that another inland co-worker can come to this remote region to work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The requirements for a successful co-worker in a remote region are faithfulness, courage, indifference to suffering, and perseverance through hundreds of hardships.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God must give the grace to some to get through!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the Lord leads you, it would be wonderful for you to come to Sikang.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It takes thirty-seven days to get to Ba-Tang from Ch'eng-tu, Szechuan.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you come from Chungking to K'un-ming and then go on to Sikang, it will take two months.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, the road through Yunnan is less steep.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It would not be too much for you to come by way of Ch'eng-tu.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May the Lord lead you!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have not seen The Open Door and The Shanghai Local Newsletter of last month.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We feel frustrated, yet because of the blocking off of communication, there is nothing we can do about it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Greetings to Brother Ju Yao-ju and to all the brothers and sisters in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Jung-jieh</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>January 1</S>
