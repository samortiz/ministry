        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRIESTS AND KINGS<br />
IN RELATION TO GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Zech. 6:12-13; 1 Pet. 2:4-5; Rev. 22:1-2</h1>
<p>In the Old Testament the offices of the priesthood and the kingship were never combined. However, Zechariah 6:12-13 says, &ldquo;Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Here is a man, whose name is the Shoot; and he will shoot forth from his place and will build the temple of Jehovah. Indeed, it is he who will build the temple of Jehovah; and he will bear majesty and will sit and rule on his throne; and he will be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace will be between the two of them.&rdquo; This is a prophecy related to the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is the Shoot of David (cf. Jer. 23:5). He will shoot forth from His place and build up God&rsquo;s temple. In the building up of God&rsquo;s temple, the Lord Jesus bears the offices of both the priesthood and the kingship. In Him these two offices are combined.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone...with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; These verses speak of our being built up together into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood. Then verse 9 says, &ldquo;You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood.&rdquo; The holy priesthood in verse 5 is referred to as a royal priesthood in verse 9. The word <em>royal</em> refers to kingship; hence, the offices of the kingship and the priesthood are also combined in the believers who are being built up together.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:1-2 says, &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; In the New Jerusalem the river of water of life proceeds out from the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. The New Jerusalem has only one street. In the original Greek the word <em>street</em> is singular; there is only one street. Since the New Jerusalem has only one street, how can the three gates on each of the four sides lead onto the same street? It must be that the street spirals down from the highest point at the center to all four sides at the bottom.</p>
<p>The throne is at the center, the highest point of the New Jerusalem, which is twelve thousand stadia tall. The walls surrounding the New Jerusalem, however, are only a hundred forty-four cubits tall. This indicates that the city proper is like a mountain with a height of twelve thousand stadia. In order to enter the gates and walk on the street, the street must reach all twelve gates; so the street must spiral upward. The higher it rises, the smaller the circle must become until the street reaches the throne at the peak. From the vantage point of the throne at the peak, however, the street spirals downward, becoming an expanding circle until it reaches the last circle at the base by all twelve gates.</p>
<p>On this street there is a river of water of life. Just as the street spirals downward, the river also flows downward. In addition to a river, there is also the tree of life. The word <em>tree</em> in the original language is also singular; there is only one tree. This tree is like a vine spiraling downward with the river, and its branches grow along the sides of the river, producing twelve kinds of fruit. These signs are very meaningful. They are more than just a beautiful picture; they are a picture of the Triune God as God, the Lamb, and the Spirit, who is symbolized by the water of life. The tree grows on the sides of the river, and the river in the middle of the street proceeds out of the throne continuously. Everyone who enters a gate, regardless of which gate, steps onto this street, drinks of the river in the middle of the street, and eats of the tree.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING FELLOWSHIP AND BLENDING<br />
IN THE SPIRIT FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Recently, the Lord has been doing a strong work in the church. Many saints are willing to be built up according to the blueprint of God, and they also are willing to build up others by the Lord&rsquo;s grace. There is a strong desire and feeling related to the building up of the church within all the saints here in Taipei. In our bread-breaking meetings and in our prayer meetings many saints are expressing their desire for this experience. This is evidence that the Lord is building up His church. When the responsible brothers brought this matter to the Lord and fellowshipped with one another, we all felt that one thing needed to be worked out in order for the building among us to progress. This matter involves our need for fellowship and blending in the spirit.</p>
<p>According to the revelation in the New Testament, those who have been redeemed by God are both the building material and the builders. The building up of those who are both the building material and the builders depends upon fellowship and blending. If we cannot fellowship and blend in the spirit, the building up will not be realized among us, no matter how much we speak of this matter.</p>
<p>We must see that the building up of the church is altogether a matter in the spirit. The building up of the church is not the result of forming a social group. A social group is easily formed when various members of a group contact and connect with one another. With a little organization and arrangement and with an orderly interaction among the members, a group can even increase in number. The building up of the church, however, cannot be accomplished in this way. Although the church is composed of human beings who are seemingly coordinated as a group of people, this is merely its outward appearance. The reality of the building up of the church is related to the saints being blended as one in the spirit. Strictly speaking, the building up of the church depends upon the spirits of the saints being blended as one. If the spirits of the saints cannot be blended together, the most that we will have is a human organization without the reality of the building up of the church. The building up of the church is entirely a matter of fellowship and blending in the spirit. When our spirits are released, there will be a blending in one spirit. This blending in the spirit is the real building up of the church. The building up of the church is a matter in life, as well as a matter in the spirit. This is the difference between the building up of the church and a social organization.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:5 says that the church is a spiritual house. This indicates that the church is a living house. A physical house has an outward structure but no spirit or life. However, the church has both Spirit and life; it is a living house. As a living house, the Spirit of God flows through the church, and the life of God is blended with the church. The Bible also speaks of the church as the Body of Christ and likens it to a body (Eph. 1:23; 1 Cor. 12:12). Since the church is likened to a body that has hands, eyes, and ears, it must be coordinated together, and there must be fellowship, like the circulation of blood. First Peter 2:2-5 shows that our being built up together depends on growing. Building comes out of growing; the church is a building that grows. Our growing up together is a matter of being joined together in the spirit.</p>
<p>Now that the saints have a positive and deep response related to the building up of the church, we should not rely merely upon more coordination, more contact, and more meetings. If this is our response, we will surely fall into an outward form of organization. In the end, we will become a people who merely have the same aspiration and same goal and who are united together to form a good Christian organization. This, however, is not the genuine building up of the church. The genuine building up of the church may have the appearance of a proper human organization, but it is intrinsically a matter of fellowship and blending in the spirit. When our spirits are blended as one with the spirits of the saints and woven into one, this is the building up of the church.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
