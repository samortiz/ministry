   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUT FROM THE HEAD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 16 says, Out from Whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our growth in life is to grow into the Head, Christ, but our function in the Body is to function out from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Firstly, we grow up into the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we have something which is out from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 16 indicates that growth is not for individuals, but for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Any growth that is not for the Body is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The words each one part refer to every member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every member of the Body of Christ has its own measure, and this measure works for the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Body causes the growth of itself through the supplying joints and working parts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both the joints of the supply and every single part with its measure are needed for the church to build itself up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The growth of the Body is the increase of Christ in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This results in the Body building itself up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A. Every Joint of the Supply</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this verse Paul speaks of every joint of the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This refers to the specially gifted persons, such as those mentioned in verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The article before the Greek word rendered supply is emphatic.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It indicates that the supply should be a particular supply, the supply of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the leading ones, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers have the supply, the particular supply.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes, we all can be today s sent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, among the saints there are those who have the particular supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This supply is not common to all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once again we see the twofoldness of the truth in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is correct to say that all the saints can do the work of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, not all have the particular supply spoken of in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Body the leading ones are the joints with the particular supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. Causing the Growth of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we read verse 16 carefully, we shall see that it says that all the Body causes the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that the Body grows by the Body itself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Body makes the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not wrong for churches to invite certain ones to come to minister the Word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, a local church is not built up in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A local church must grow by the local church itself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, it is the church in Anaheim that makes the growth of the church in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even a very small church must grow by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you cannot cause the church in your locality to grow, then you should not be there as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not expect that visits from those brothers who share in the ministry of the Word will cause the growth of the church in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 16 speaks of the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that a local church must build itself up in love through every joint of the supply and according to the operation of the measure of each one part.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those with the particular supply are not only in the Body as a whole, but also in the local churches, which are the practical expression of the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if the number of saints in a church is very small, perhaps only fifteen, there will still be some with the particular supply.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This should be an encouragement to every local church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through the particular supply of the leading ones and through the operation in each part, the church will cause the growth of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this way we shall see the growth of the members for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
