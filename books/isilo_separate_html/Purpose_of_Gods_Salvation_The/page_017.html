<p>We must also make a resolution to preach the gospel. Christians must preach the gospel. A Christian who has never brought anyone to salvation has a spiritual problem. The fruit-bearing branches of a tree are an example. The branches that do not bear fruit are sick. Another example is that of people getting married and having children; when life grows to a certain point, it will produce offspring. This is normal. Because we are saved, we are branches of the Lord, the vine. Therefore, we must grow in life so that we can bear fruit. Every child of God should bring forth spiritual children. The apostle Paul did not have children in the flesh, but he had spiritual children, such as Timothy and Titus, whom he brought forth, raised, and taught in the Lord (1 Tim. 1:1-2; 2 Tim. 1:1-2; Titus 1:4). After a person is saved, he should not wait three to five years before bringing someone to the Lord. A believer who does this has a spiritual problem. Therefore, we must make a resolution to preach the gospel and bring at least one person to the Lord each year.</p>
<p>However, we should not be hasty. After we have the desire to preach the gospel, we should first pray to consecrate ourselves to the Lord. Second, we should make a list of our relatives and friends and pray for the ones who are not saved. If a relative or friend is not in our locality, we may write him a gospel letter and ask the saints in that locality to visit him and give him gospel tracts, books, or the Bible. This would help our relative or friend to be brought into that local church. If a relative or friend lives close to us, we should seek the Lord concerning how to visit him or to invite him for a meal. Our contact for the gospel should be in coordination with the saints. We should not be hasty, nor should we expect everyone to get saved immediately upon hearing the gospel. We just need to receive a burden from the Lord and then spend a year bringing one person to the Lord. If we are burdened to preach the gospel to a relative or friend whom we have not been in touch with, we must first build a little friendship with him. Do not rush into preaching the gospel. We should first establish a friendship and then slowly bring up the gospel or give him a few books. After a few months we can invite him for a meal and also invite two saints to speak with him. We should move slowly and wait until he has a taste for the Lord before inviting him to hear the gospel. Haste makes waste, and rushing may slow things down. As long as we can maintain our burden for him, pray for him, and work on him, he will get saved. If the saints are willing to do this, we will be able to bring the Chinese as well as the Americans to the Lord. If we will spend the time, our relatives and friends will be baptized.</p>
<p>People say that it is difficult to preach the gospel in America but easy in China, but this is not the case. A tree can grow and bear sweet fruit. However, a dead tree is not completely useless; as long as we work on it, we can make a good vessel or a tool out of it. I believe that it is not difficult to preach the gospel in America, but this depends on whether we are willing to make an effort. For thirty years when I went to the countryside in China, people would say that it was easier to preach the gospel in the city, but when I went to the city, people would say that it was easier to preach the gospel in the countryside. The Christians in both the countryside and the city had many excuses for not preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>In April 1942 I was in Tsingtao. When the brothers there heard that Chefoo was blessed, they said that Tsingtao was a dead city and could not be enlivened and that in the northern cities of Tientsin and Tsingtao everything but religion prospers; hence, they said it was difficult to preach the gospel. I knew this was an excuse to avoid preaching the gospel. There were around a hundred and thirty saints in Tsingtao. I gathered the saints and led them first to meet for several days and then to preach the gospel. As a result, from April to June we had six or seven baptismal meetings and baptized about two hundred. That year the number of people meeting in Tsingtao doubled. The gospel was later interrupted by the Second Sino-Japanese War, but after the victory was won, Tsingtao had a revival in 1948 and 1949, and more than seven hundred were baptized in one meeting. This shows that it is not difficult to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>The same happened in Shanghai. In 1942 the church in Shanghai had an internal problem, and at the same time the Japanese were forcing the church to join their false Christian organization. Because the church in Shanghai refused to join, it had to close down for more than three years. The breaking of bread did not resume until 1945, and there were only a little over a hundred people. After the victory of the Second Sino-Japanese War was won in 1946, the brothers wanted me to go to Shanghai. By the time I arrived in Shanghai, the saints in Shanghai had heard that the churches in the north had been blessed. However, when I mentioned preaching the gospel, they said that the northerners were simple and leisurely, and hence it was easier to preach the gospel to them, but the Shanghainese were sophisticated and busy, and hence it would not be easy for them to believe the gospel. Instead of arguing with them, I said, &ldquo;Let us try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We started meeting at the end of 1946 and had a gospel meeting at the beginning of the following year. I can testify that it was easy to preach the gospel. A multitude of people came to the first gospel meeting, and one to two hundred people were baptized. This happened more than once. By the summer of 1947, less than a year after we began preaching the gospel, the church in Shanghai had seventeen districts and over a thousand people. Therefore, we should never believe that it is difficult to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>The same thing happened in Hong Kong. I visited Hong Kong in 1948, and the church met upstairs in a small, quiet, and desolate building. In 1950 the church in Hong Kong still met upstairs in the same small, quiet, and desolate building. Brother Watchman Nee cabled me in Taiwan and asked me to go to Hong Kong. One evening I told the serving brothers that Hong Kong is a modern city, but our meeting place was in a small building with narrow stairs, and it was even difficult to find the doorbell. The meeting place had an old organ that had been donated to the church by a missionary before he went back to his country. The brothers said that they did not know Cantonese and that the Cantonese people were not open to those from their province. However, I said that we must preach the gospel to bring people in. When we did, the church in Hong Kong grew so large that it had to build a large meeting hall in order to accommodate everyone. The number of people kept increasing, and eventually even the new meeting hall was too small.</p>
<p>Everyone thinks that it is easy to preach the gospel in Taiwan. When we first arrived in Taiwan, people said it would not be easy to preach the gospel. They had all kinds of excuses, such as, the Taiwanese were not open to outsiders, and the mainlanders were not open because they had not yet settled down. These were words of cold water. Now, however, everyone says that it is easy to preach the gospel in Taiwan. These examples prove that it is easy to preach the gospel; it depends on whether we are willing. It is not difficult to preach the gospel in America either. The day will come when we will prove that it is easy to preach the gospel in America. Whether or not it is easy to preach the gospel, we must always receive the burden and make an effort. If we would receive the burden, look to the Lord, and make a resolution to bring one person to the Lord in a year, we will succeed. If a locality has fifty saints, it will have a hundred saints the following year, two hundred the year after, and four hundred the year after that. Such an increase would be marvelous. May we all respond to the Lord and make a resolution to bring people to salvation.</p>
<p>In regard to preaching the gospel, no one can boast of seniority; we must remind and incite one another. The church does not have a regulation of preaching the gospel, but we must care for one another and bring people into the church. If we are faithful, our number will double in one year. We should not think that it is too difficult; difficulty comes from Satan, the devil. Nothing is too hard for God (Jer. 32:17, ASV; Luke 1:37). As long as we are willing to make an effort, someone will be saved. We should preach the gospel to the Americans and bring them to salvation and into the church life. We should not work only on the Chinese in America. We are all sojourners in America; therefore, we should bring grace to the locals, and let them continue the work with us.</p>
<p>The results depend on whether we can carry out the gospel faithfully. May we make a resolution to practice these three important matters. Without such a resolution, we will merely be meeting year after year without pursuing the Lord, without growing in our knowledge of the Lord, without having more fellowship with the Lord, and without preaching the gospel. Eventually, our labor will not have much fruit. We cannot leave things to fate; we must rise up and do our best. Our effort determines how much God will bless us, and our response determines how much grace we will experience. The Lord has already given us grace; therefore, instead of making more excuses, we should receive the Lord&rsquo;s grace and eat joyously and be satisfied. These are not matters of doctrine but of practice. Hence, we must make a resolution. Our resolution is our response to the Lord&rsquo;s grace. If we make a resolution and practice these matters, we will be blessed.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
