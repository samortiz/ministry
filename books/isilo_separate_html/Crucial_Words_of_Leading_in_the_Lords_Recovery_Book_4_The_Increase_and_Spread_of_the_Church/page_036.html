<p>The small group gatherings should also have the supply of the word as their content. This is the life pulse of the group gatherings, and while it is the most important item in a Christian meeting, it is often the most difficult item. However, the Lord&rsquo;s word among us is not scarce. Volume after volume of Life-studies have opened the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. As long as we spend a few minutes every morning to read two or three verses with their footnotes and three to five paragraphs of a related Life-study message, we will be filled with a supply. Over the course of a year, we will build up a great deposit of the truth in us. Then when we attend the group gatherings, the Spirit will guide us to speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>In the small group gatherings the supply of the word must be focused on God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is the Triune God becoming flesh, passing through human living, death on the cross, and resurrection from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit to dispense Himself into every believer so that we can become the children of God and the members of Christ as His Body. This is God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This does not mean that we must recite this statement every time we meet. We can speak about many points in the Bible, but our focus must be on the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen people.</p>
<p>One time a local church invited me to preach the gospel. The title of one of the messages was &ldquo;The Triune God Dispensing Himself into the Tripartite Man,&rdquo; and I spoke from Romans 8. Some may think that this topic is too deep and that many would not understand it, but such a thought only shows how much we underestimate people&rsquo;s capacity to receive. The truth of the tripartite nature of man is a proof that man has the capacity to receive the dispensing of the Triune God, and for this dispensing, there must be a God-given capability for man to understand and to contact God. We must change our concept and not think that others cannot understand; rather, we must see that it is our limited ability to speak that hinders people from understanding and receiving the supply of the word. If we know how to speak, people will understand.</p>
<p>When I first heard about computers, I could not grasp the concept of a computer. After I gained some understanding about computers, I discovered that even a ten-year-old child knows how to use a computer. I did not understand computers, but even a ten-year-old child knows the difference between software and hardware. When my grandchildren received a computer, they plugged it in and immediately started playing with it. When I saw this, I was amazed and encouraged. Based on my remembrance of this experience, I decided to speak on &ldquo;The Triune God Dispensing Himself into the Tripartite Man&rdquo; when I preached the gospel that day. I spoke about the Triune God and about the tripartite man, and the people listened with keen interest and understanding. Hence, we should never say that people in a group gathering will not understand our speaking related to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. People will understand if our speaking is adequate. While they may not appear to understand, they will understand after hearing it again and again. We should not underestimate people. Man was created by God with three parts, and even though man has a mind and a body, he also has a spirit to contact God.</p>
<p>For this reason, we need to cultivate our understanding of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This does not require much effort. With just ten minutes every day over a period of a year, we will accumulate a considerable amount. We must be truthful with the Lord. Since we love Him, we should practice a life of enjoying Him. In the morning watch, we should spend five minutes to pray and five minutes to read the Word, and then gradually increase our prayer to ten minutes and our reading of the Word to ten minutes. Everyone can pay this price. If we have such an exercise every morning, we will definitely have a supply for others in the group gatherings. Furthermore, we have many spiritual books and publications. For the past eleven years, these publications have all been focused on God&rsquo;s economy. Line by line and point by point, they all speak concerning God&rsquo;s economy, which is God&rsquo;s desire to dispense Himself into His chosen people. If we are willing to make the effort to obtain the material from these books, we will be faithful ministers of the word.</p>
<p>Our speaking should not be loose and without structure; we must have a clear line and a definite emphasis. This requires practice. As long as we have the heart and are willing to learn, everyone in the meetings can speak the word, but the speaking must have a line and a focus.</p>
<p>We must avoid speaking about things that are different from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The Bible speaks of &ldquo;the unsearchable riches of Christ&rdquo; and &ldquo;the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; We must learn to speak concerning things such as these, which are related to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and not speak different teachings. In this regard, it is best to use the Life-studies. When I say this, I am not speaking like a melon-seller who exaggerates the sweetness of his melons. Last year a few brothers wrote me a letter saying that they had compared the Life-studies to several other expository books. After much comparison, they acknowledged that the Life-studies were higher, richer, and deeper. When I wrote the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the Bible, I read many expository books. I am standing on their shoulders, so I know that the Life-studies are higher. What these expositions have, I also have, but what I have, they do not have. This is only because they came before me; some were written two hundred years ago, and others were written one hundred years ago. The light they have cannot be compared to the light we have today. Even an ordinary electrician has greater knowledge about electrical lights than Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb. Hence, I advise you to save your money and not buy so many reference books and to save your eyesight and time, because the essence of all the useful expositions is in the Life-studies and footnotes of the Recovery Version of the Bible. I have studied all the famous expositors in Christianity, and I have also spent nearly eleven years writing in order to finally complete the work of the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-studies. These are the best materials to use in the small groups.</p>
<p>Recently the serving ones at the ministry office in the United States selected some precious quotations from the Life-studies and the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the Bible and framed them. When I read these words, I could not help asking myself, &ldquo;Did I say this? Did I write this?&rdquo; If the source had not been cited, I would hardly have believed that I wrote them. The treasure within them is too rich. A footnote is often written by compiling the main points from ten books. Sometimes a very long footnote required a week to write. Not only did I read the original text to find the meaning of a particular word in a verse, but I also read the comments of well-known writers on the same verse. Furthermore, I also added my own consideration. These tasks often took a considerable amount of effort. All of you are my family, so I can tell you the work that I have done; it is definitely worth your effort to extract the riches from the Life-studies.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Perfecting Every Believer</h2>
<p>The group gatherings should always have a goal of perfecting every believer to know and speak the truth, to grow in life and increase in spiritual stature, to live in the Body, be built up together, and live the church life, and to spread the gospel and save sinners. In other words, there are four main items: truth, life, the church, and the gospel.</p>
<p>I hope that after one or two years, everyone who participates in the small group gatherings will be able to speak the truth, to testify concerning their growth in life, to live the church life, and to preach the gospel. Truth, life, the church, and the gospel are the goal of our small group gatherings.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
