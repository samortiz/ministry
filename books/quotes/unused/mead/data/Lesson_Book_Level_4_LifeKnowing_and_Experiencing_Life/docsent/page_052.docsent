   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. A Godless Civilization</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man fell by committing sin and was expelled from the garden of Eden!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His relationship with God became abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But God prepared a covering of skins for man's redemption, enabling him to remain in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As yet, man had not lost God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, during Cain's lifetime man fell deeper into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Cain said to God, "Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid'' Gen 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah'' v. 16 . Thus man left God's presence completely and lost God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When he lost God, man naturally lost God's provision, protection, and pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When man lost God's care for his livelihood, he first experienced fear; he feared the lack of supply, defense, and happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other words, he feared poverty, danger, and boredom with life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, in order to meet the necessities of life and survive, man used his own strength and devised means of supply, defense, and amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From this time, man created a godless civilization.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 4 clearly reveals this to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the fall of Cain, out of his descendants were produced the founders of man's own supply for these three great needs of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These were the three sons of Lamech.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jabal was the father of tent-dwellers and cattlemen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Tents and cattle are for the supply of man's living and therefore belong to the category of provision.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Another son, Jubal, was the father of all that handle the harp and organ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Playing harp and organ is for pleasure; thus it belongs to the category of amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The third son, Tubalcain, was the instructor of every artificer in brass and iron instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These instruments were formed for the purpose of defense, thus referring to the category of protection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since these three important inventions originated at that time, humanity found no need of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man found within himself the answer to the need of supply, defense, and amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was the civilization produced after the human race lost God a godless life created by men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>C. Satan's System</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When mankind lived a godless life, Satan immediately disguised himself and utilized these avenues as a means to possess man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He caused man to employ his entire effort to seek food and clothing for self-nurture, to invent instruments for self-defense and to design various forms of amusements for self-enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the beginning, these various forms of occupations involving man's livelihood seemed rather trivial, scattered and unsystematized.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, Satan organized these into a more tangible and systematized world, thus entangling mankind in a tighter web.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the formation of the world has five steps.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, man lost God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, he developed fear and was desperate concerning his needs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Third, he created a godless life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fourth, Satan disguised himself and utilized man's needs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fifth, Satan organized man's own supply for his needs into a system.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the completion of these five steps the world was finally formed.</S>
