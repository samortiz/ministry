This indicates that, according to His loving concern over His dear redeemed saints, the Lord's intention concerning all the believers who are involved in the tests of the oneness of His Body and of the one accord of His church is to adjust, correct, rescue, recover, and perfect them so that He can carry out the building up of His organic Body.</P><P>Among the sixteen cases remaining to be dealt with in the way of quarantine, there are two cases of division (cases V and XXXI), thirteen cases of heresy (cases III, XII, XVI, XXIV, XXVII, XXXIII, XXXIV, XXXV, XXXVI, XXXVIII, XL, XLIV, and XLVI), and one case of gross sin (case VIII).</P><P>Concerning the first case of division (case V), the Apostle Paul decisively and emphatically gave us a strong charge that we should carry out a quarantine by "turning away from" the divisive persons (Rom. 16:17). Concerning the second case of division (case XXXI), the Apostle Paul also charged us strongly and decisively to exercise a stern quarantine by refusing the factious, divisive person (Titus 3:10).</P><P>As to the thirteen cases of heresy, case III was taken care of by the proper fellowship according to the truth (Acts 15:1-31); cases XII, XXIV, XXXV, and XXXVI were taken care of by teaching; case XVI was dealt with by cursing the heretics (Gal. 1:8-9); cases XXVII, XXXIII, XXXIV, and XL were taken care of by warning the saints; cases XLIV and XLVI were dealt with by condemnation; and case XXXVIII was dealt with by the exercising of a quarantine. In case XXXVIII, the Apostle John sharply and emphatically charged us not to receive into our house a heretic who does not confess Christ's coming in the flesh but goes beyond the teaching of Christ, and even not to greet him, that we may not share in his evil works (2 John 7, 9-11).</P><P>Concerning case VIII, a case of gross sin, the Apostle Paul took care of it first by judging the sinning one in the name of the Lord and delivering him to Satan for destruction of the flesh (1 Cor. 5:3-5), and then by solemnly charging the saints to exercise to quarantine the sinning one by not eating with him and removing him from the fellowship in the church (1 Cor. 5:11, 13).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> </body></html>
