<h2 class="head4">b. By the Word of Their Testimony</h2><p>They also overcame the enemy by &ldquo;the word of their testimony.&rdquo; This is their word testifying that the Devil has been judged by the Lord. Whenever we sense the Devil&rsquo;s accusation, we should verbally testify how the Lord has already dealt with him. We must declare the Lord&rsquo;s victory over him with the uttered word. We need to testify not only to men but also to the demons, saying, &ldquo;Demons, you must be reminded that Satan, your king, has been defeated by my Lord Jesus Christ. You should not be here troubling me.&rdquo; Along with testifying to the demons, you need to preach to Satan, saying, &ldquo;Satan, don&rsquo;t you know that you have been crucified on the cross? You have been judged, and your destination is the lake of fire.&rdquo; This is the testimony of your verbal word. Do not simply keep these thoughts in your mind&mdash;you must utter them to Satan. Although no one may be with you in your room, Satan is there. I have preached to the demons and to Satan. That preaching was not for their repentance; it was a repellent. By spraying the heavenly poison through our verbal testimony, all the &ldquo;bugs&rdquo; are killed. You may not see any demons, but they are there. Some brothers have wondered how I can be so strong. The reason is that by preaching to the &ldquo;bugs&rdquo; I am strengthened. But my strength is not in what I am&mdash;it is in what the blood is. I am not the poison. The demons are not afraid of what I am, but they are afraid of what the blood is. We need to apply the blood.</p><p>Shortly after we moved into our new house, we were troubled by gophers. Some brothers put poison into the gopher holes, and all the troublesome gophers were exterminated. Our &ldquo;poison&rdquo; today is the blood of Jesus and the word of our testimony.</p><p>We need to send out the word of our testimony. At times, you may need to preach to Satan for several minutes, saying, &ldquo;Satan, I was deceived by you for years. One day, my Lord came to me and said that I was redeemed at the cross. Satan, don&rsquo;t you know this?&rdquo; You need to speak to him like this. Many of us have never preached to Satan, but now we all must learn to do this. If you would preach prevailingly, the first person to whom you must preach is Satan. This preaching to the enemy is the word of our testimony.</p><p>Our testimony is that we were sinners but that the Lord is our Redeemer. He died on the cross for our sins, and now we have His blood. Tell this to Satan! After you have spoken to him about this, say, &ldquo;Satan, you should not be here. Your destiny is firstly the abyss and then the lake of fire. But I want you to stay here awhile until I have finished my message to you. Only then will I allow you to be released.&rdquo; If you preach to Satan like this, the accuser will not dare to trouble you because you trouble him. After you have finished your message, say to the enemy, &ldquo;Satan, don&rsquo;t come back again. If you do, I&rsquo;ll give you a longer sermon.&rdquo;</p><p>The brothers overcame him not only by means of the blood, but also by the word of their testimony. The blood is the fact, and the word is our preaching. The blood implies the fact that our sins have been forgiven and taken away, that we have been crucified, that Satan has been judged, and that his head has been bruised. When we apply the blood, we apply all these facts. After applying the blood, we must declare the facts to Satan. This is the way to overcome the enemy.</p><p>If you apply the blood and preach to Satan, he will be threatened. He accuses you, troubles you, and makes you of none effect. He would destroy you by his accusations. I am afraid that many dear ones are still under the destruction of the Devil&rsquo;s accusations. They say, &ldquo;Oh, I love the Lord, but I am not perfect. I have made so many mistakes and blunders.&rdquo; The result of these accusations is to make you of no effect. Through the crippling effect of his accusations, the enemy confiscates you. But you must tell him, &ldquo;Devil, my standing is not my perfection. My standing and my covering are the blood.&rdquo; Anyone who is still under Satan&rsquo;s accusations should preach a long sermon to him. If you do this, you will immediately be strengthened.</p>
