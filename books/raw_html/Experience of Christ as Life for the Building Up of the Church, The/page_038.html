<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>EXPERIENCING THE SPIRIT<br>IN SECOND CORINTHIANS</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:21-22; 3:3, 6, 8, 17-18; 5:5; 13:14</H1><P>We have seen that there are four lines in 1 Corinthians: the line of Christ, the line of the gifts, the line of the spirit (including the Holy Spirit), and the line of the church. All except one of these lines, the line of the gifts, is continued in 2 Corinthians. This line is replaced with the line of the ministry, which is formed and produced by the experience of Christ through much suffering. In 2 Corinthians 3 there is the ministry of the Spirit (v. 8), not the gifts of the Spirit. The ministry is not produced overnight. It is produced over time through suffering. If you know the Lord's gracious dealing, you will kiss all the sufferings. Sufferings work out something which is much better than the gifts, that is, the ministry.</P><P>We have seen that 1 Corinthians reveals many aspects of Christ more or less in a doctrinal way. Chapter one says the Jews require signs and the Greeks seek wisdom, but Paul preached Christ crucified, and Christ is the power and wisdom of God (vv. 22-24). In chapter two Paul said he made the decision not to know anything except Christ and Christ crucified (v. 2). Then in the following chapters, he went on to reveal more aspects of Christ in a doctrinal way. But when Paul spoke of Christ in 2 Corinthians, he spoke in the way of experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LINE OF THE SPIRIT IN SECOND CORINTHIANS</H2><P>First Corinthians, in a sense, is for doctrine. Second Corinthians is for experience. We can see this when we consider the line of the spirit in these two books. In 1 Corinthians 2 Paul told us that the Spirit reveals the deep things of God to us (v. 10). Then chapter three says that the Spirit dwells within us (v. 16). Chapter twelve speaks of the gifts of the Spirit (vv. 4-11) and says that we have been baptized in the Spirit and are drinking of the one Spirit (v. 13). Chapter fifteen reveals that Christ, as the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit (v. 45b).</P><P>When we consider all these aspects of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians, we can realize that they are mentioned with a lack of experience. Paul's mentioning of the Spirit in 2 Corinthians is more experiential. In chapter one he says that the Spirit is the anointing Spirit and the sealing Spirit. This Spirit is also in our hearts as a pledge, a foretaste (vv. 21-22).</P><P>In chapter three there are five aspects of this subjective Spirit. First, He is the writing Spirit (v. 3); then He is the life-giving Spirit (v. 6). He is also the ministering Spirit, who always ministers something of Christ into us (v. 8). He is the liberating Spirit (v. 17) to liberate us from all the things that bind us. He liberates us from the bondage of doctrines, the letter, the written codes and regulations. He delivers us by taking away all the veils so that we can behold and reflect Christ with an unveiled face. Then He is the transforming Spirit. We are being transformed into the glorious image of the Lord from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit (v. 18).</P><P>The last verse of 2 Corinthians speaks of the fellowship of the Holy Spirit (13:14). The fellowship here is the transmission. The love of the Father is the source, the grace of the Son is the course, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the transmission that transmits all that Christ is as grace to us with God the Father as love.</P><P>Second Corinthians is a book of transmission, not a book of doctrine. The nine aspects of the Spirit we have mentioned above are altogether in the realm of experience. These nine aspects once again are: the anointing Spirit, the sealing Spirit, the pledging Spirit, the writing Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the ministering Spirit, the liberating Spirit, the transforming Spirit, and the transmitting Spirit. This wonderful Spirit transmits all the riches of Christ with the fullness of the Father into us.</P>
