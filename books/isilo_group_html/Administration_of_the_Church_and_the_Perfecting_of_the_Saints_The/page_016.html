IN THE CHURCH SERVICE</h2>
<p><em>Question: In the past a sister offended many people in the service and later quit serving. She recently had a turn, and we would like to bring her back into service, but many sisters are opposed to this. What should we do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The basic problem in some churches is that too much emphasis is put on arrangements. There cannot be services in a local church without arrangements, but we must avoid emphasizing arrangements. It is as if people cannot serve without our arrangements. If we do not reduce the amount of such arrangements, it will become a hindrance to the service. If not for the emphasis on our arrangements, this sister could have begun serving as soon as she had a turn. If she has the burden to sweep the floor and clean the hall, she can sweep the floor and clean the hall. If she has the burden to serve the children, she can serve the children. Does she need permission to share or testify in the meeting? We must not turn the service of the church into an organization. A person does not need to pass through certain procedures before he can serve.</p>
<p>Some do not approve, because of their emphasis on arrangements. Approval and disapproval have no value in the church. It is not that Brother B can serve because Brother A approves or that Brother B cannot serve because Brother A does not approve. The value of our service depends on our fellowship with the Lord, our relationship with the Lord, and our burden from the Lord. If I have a burden from the Lord, I should sweep the floor when others approve and when others do not approve. If I have a burden from the Lord, I should testify when others approve and when others do not approve. Then the approving and disapproving voices in the church will be rendered useless. The organizational arrangement has created an atmosphere in which people&rsquo;s approval or disapproval is becoming influential. Such influence must be reduced. No one should say that he does not approve of a certain brother or sister serving. We must learn the lesson that our approving and disapproving should only be toward ourselves, not toward others. We should listen to messages for ourselves, not for others. In the church we must apply everything to ourselves; we must not point at others. Instead of criticizing others for not praying, we should pray more. We should praise the Lord if others pray and praise Him if others do not pray. The saints love the Lord. Their situation is not for us to judge. We can judge only ourselves.</p>
<p>We must create a healthy and proper atmosphere in the church and have a proper heart toward the saints. A sister might have been wrong in the past, but she might turn after a period of time. When she returns to serve, everyone should rejoice and be glad. It is dangerous for a person to quit serving, because he may leave the church forever. This sister did not leave the church, and she came back to serve. We should rejoice for her and give her another chance. Everyone should learn this lesson.</p>
<p>Whether or not a person is an elder or a co-worker, he should not judge others. Whether others are right or wrong, we should point only at ourselves, not at others. Although I should not rebuke the elders in the presence of others, I have the position and ground to rebuke the elders. Others may not have such a position. Therefore, they are wrong to convict the elders using my words.</p>
<p>We must not listen to these messages for others; we must listen to them for ourselves. If we would learn to fear the Lord and receive the grace to learn the lessons, the church will have a future. The future of the church depends on the saints and the elders. The future of the church is affected by our condition. Therefore, we must humbly ask the Lord to have mercy on us so that we would be willing to accept everything that He has spoken in these messages. We should take the condition of others as a warning and ask the Lord to have mercy on us so that we would learn the lessons and not repeat their condition. This is the proper spirit. The future of the church concerns us all; hence, we all must learn the lessons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING, HAVING A STRONG SPIRIT,<br />
AND SUPPLYING LIFE</h2>
<p><em>Question: There are only two elderly couples in our district. How can they serve?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This question is related to the previous one. There is a problem with the leading of the elders if the saints need to be asked to serve and coordinate in the church. The overall leading in the church should be for every saint, whether young or old, to serve. When everyone is serving, the saints can be given specific leading according to their situation. The elders should regularly give the church extensive and thorough leading. For example, a nation that maintains proper public health will be exempt from the trouble of relying only on vaccinations. May the Lord give us wisdom concerning how to lead the saints.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should not depend on arrangements. The elders must pray much and have more experiences of life. They also need to lead in life and cultivate a spiritual atmosphere in the meetings. If we would pray more, we would be strong in spirit and rich in the divine life; we would also want to serve. Our leading is organizational if it is merely based on the messages that we have heard and the methods that we have learned but lacks our experiences of life and our living in the spirit. If our leading is organizational, the saints will not receive the supply of life, and their spirit will not be strong. Furthermore, in such a situation the saints will only go as far as we drag them.</p>
<p>If we have the experiences of life, have a strong spirit, and supply life in the meetings to enliven the saints, they will spontaneously come to serve. There will be no need for many arrangements. Certain services of the church need arrangements in order to avoid chaos. However, if we can avoid arrangements, it is best to follow the leading of the Spirit and let everyone serve livingly in spirit without arrangements. We must be rich in our experience of life, have a strong spirit, and be living so that we will spontaneously be able to help others. When the church is brought into the realm of life, it will be easy for all the saints to serve.</p>
<p>In order for our spirit to be strong, we must pray much. It is impossible to be strong in spirit or to be rich in the divine life without praying. We must learn to pray, to contact the Lord and fellowship with Him. There is no need to be anxious concerning how to do things; the more we do, the more we will know. If we have never served, we will not know how to serve. We must pray in order for our spirit to be strong, just as children must eat in order to be physically strong and healthy. The elders must learn to pray; otherwise, they cannot serve properly.</p>
<p>We should not believe in our own ability or methods. Ability and methods may be successful in a social group, but they must not be used in the church. The church is an organism, not an organization. Hence, the leading ones must be in life. Organization, ability, and methods are of no use in the church; only life, which comes from prayer, is useful. We must learn to pray. The more we pray, the better.</p>
<p>When the responsible brothers meet together, they should spend at least three-quarters of their time praying together, and the remaining time can be spent discussing matters. Most of the time prayer is merely a formality, because most of the meeting is spent discussing matters. The elders should have thorough prayer when they gather together; they do not need to spend so much time to discuss or to study. They must exercise to pray, to be strong in spirit, to be living in spirit, and to learn the lesson of not depending on themselves. The more we depend on ourselves, the less we will pray. But the more we depend on the Lord, the more we will pray, and the more we pray, the more we will depend on the Lord. After we pass through prayer, we will let the Lord do what we formerly would have done ourselves.</p>
<p>We have many lessons to learn. Instead of doing things ourselves, we should let the Lord work. If the Lord does not do something, we should pray until He does something. Even if the Lord does only a little, it is a matter of life; however, there is no life in what we do. What the Lord does has life, but what we do does not have life. What the Lord does is in the organic realm of the Body, but what we do is only a social method. Therefore, every service must pass through prayer. Prayer cultivates our spirit to be living and strong and brings the proper atmosphere into the meetings. Those who pray much are strong in spirit and rich in life. Those who do not pray have a weak spirit and lack life. Only prayer can make us strong in spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Perfecting of the Saints &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
