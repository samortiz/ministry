   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF DEUTERONOMY MESSAGE FIVE DEUTERONOMY A BOOK CONCERNING CHRIST Scripture Reading: Deut 8:1-10; Matt 4:4; John 1:1, 14; Gal 2:20; 1 Cor 6:17b; 15:10; 2 Cor 13:14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing messages we have covered three matters: an introductory word to the life-study of Deuteronomy, the crucial points in Deuteronomy, and the review of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we turn in the next message to the lengthy section on the rehearsal of the law 4:44 26:19 , I would like to give a word regarding the Christ unveiled in Deuteronomy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>UNVEILING CHRIST MAINLY IN TWO ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The book of Deuteronomy unveils Christ mainly in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, this book shows us Christ as the goal, the aim, prepared for us by God 8:7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As this goal, Christ is the all-inclusive good land.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The good land, the land of Canaan, is a type of the all-inclusive Christ, the Christ who is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The good land provided whatever the children of Israel needed: water, wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive trees, animals, milk, honey, stones, iron, copper.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All these items, most of which are mentioned in 8:7-10, are types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is the water flowing forth in valleys and mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the wheat, which signifies the incarnated and crucified Christ, and the barley, which signifies the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The vine typifies Christ as the sacrificing One who cheers God and man; the fig tree, the sweetness and satisfaction of Christ as our life supply; the pomegranate, the abundance and beauty of the life of Christ; the olive tree, Christ as the man filled with the Spirit and anointed with the Spirit as the oil of exultant joy; the animal life, Christ with His redeeming life; milk and honey, Christ in His richness and sweetness; stones, iron, and copper, Christ as the materials for building and fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This all-inclusive Christ, the Christ typified by the good land, is our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second, the book of Deuteronomy unveils Christ as the life with the strength and ability to reach the God-appointed goal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, Christ is both our goal and the way, the life, the strength, and the ability for us to reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>GOD MANIFESTED, MAN EXPOSED,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AND CHRIST UNVEILED</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the book of Deuteronomy, as in the Bible as a whole, God is manifested, man is exposed, and Christ is unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is rather easy to realize that the Bible manifests God to us, showing us that God is loving, righteous, and faithful and that He is a blessing God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since the Bible fully exposes us, when we come to the Bible, it is also easy for us to see what we are and where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, it is not easy for us to realize that the Bible unveils Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many readers of the Bible can see that it manifests God and exposes man but do not see that it unveils Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians, therefore, can apply the manifestation of God and the exposure of man in the Bible, but few can apply the unveiling of Christ in the Word.</S>
