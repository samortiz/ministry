THE GOSPEL, INCLUDING THE TRUTHS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not by the Apostles but by the Migrated Disciples</h2>
<p>Now we need to consider the initial example of the spreading of the gospel, including the truths (Acts 8:1, 4). According to Acts 8, this spreading was not by the apostles but by the migrated disciples. The church in Jerusalem had thousands of believers, but due to persecution, they were all scattered to carry out the spreading of the gospel. The believers were scattered, but the apostles remained. The practice today in Christianity is the opposite; the clergy go and the laymen remain. But the spreading of the gospel according to the initial example in Acts 8 shows the apostles remaining in Jerusalem and the other disciples migrating.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Waiting for the Completion<br />
of the Gospel in the Holy Land</h2>
<p>The disciples sovereignly were scattered to other places without waiting for the completion of the gospel in the Holy Land. Portions of the Holy Land had not yet heard the gospel, but the Lord was still burdened for the disciples to carry the gospel to other places. Acts 8 also speaks of Philip going to Samaria and eventually preaching the gospel to an Ethiopian eunuch for the spread of the divine truths.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The First Mentioning of Migration<br />
for the Spreading of the Gospel Being the Basic Principle for the Spreading of the Gospel, Including the Divine Truths</h2>
<p>The scattering of the believers from Jerusalem to other localities is the first mentioning of migration for the spreading of the gospel; hence, it should be considered as the basic principle for the spreading of the gospel, including the divine truths. Regardless of whether or not the divine truths have reached the entire United States, we still need to go to Europe. We also have to believe that our going to Europe will stir up something positive in the United States.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE VISION OF THE LORD IN HIS RECOVERY<br />
AND ANSWERING THE CALL OF HIS CHARGE</h2>
<p>We need to see the vision of the Lord in His recovery and answer the call of His charge (cf. Isa. 6:1, 8).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Consecration and Absoluteness<br />
for the Lord Needing to Be Rekindled</h2>
<p>Our consecration and absoluteness for the Lord need to be rekindled. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, I still love You. I want to love You more.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Rising Up to Follow the Lord in His Present Move<br />
and Having Ourselves Adjusted<br />
to His Regulations to Be Useful to Him</h2>
<p>We should rise up to follow the Lord in His present move and have ourselves adjusted to His regulations to be useful to Him (Dan. 11:32; 2 Tim. 2:21). Daniel 11:32 says, &ldquo;The people who know their God will show strength and take action.&rdquo; To take action means to do something noble and worthy which may be considered as an achievement. Especially in these days in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we need to be those who show strength and take action.</p>
<p>For us to be useful to the Lord, we need to be particularly sanctified and adjusted in many aspects and in many things that we could be a vessel unto honor at this particular time.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
