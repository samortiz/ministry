   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>FOREWORD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the Lord s children, we need a proper spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We also need the proper spiritual service.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This book, which contains messages given by Witness Lee in 1963 and 1969 in Los Angeles, California, covers the three basic matters crucial to serving the Lord in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It shows us that for the proper Christian service we must serve in the Body, in our human spirit, and by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible reveals that the foundation of all genuine Christian service is the built up church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s unique goal is to gain a Body for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did not regenerate us to be individual units complete in ourselves Col 3:15 , but to be members of this unique Body 1 Cor 12:12, 20 which is a corporate entity, a spiritual house, a holy and royal priesthood 1 Pet 2:5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Having been placed in the Body 1 Cor 12:18 , as members we must be tempered together 1 Cor 12:24 , and as living stones we must be built up together 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our service should never be carried out in an independent way or in an individualistic manner, but in coordination with the other members in the Body Rom 12:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our service must be something of the Body, in the Body, with the Body, and for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To enter into the reality and practicality of this service, growth in life is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the growth in life the church cannot be built up Eph 2:21; 4:15-16 , and without the built up church there cannot be the genuine service.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Also, without the Holy Spirit we do not have the way to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, to apply the Holy Spirit in our service, we must serve God in our human spirit Rom 1:9 , even in newness of spirit Rom 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we were regenerated, we were born of the Holy Spirit in our spirit John 3:6 , and we became one spirit with the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From this time onward we need to live, to walk, to act, and to serve in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The main purpose of our service is to minister Christ as life to others; thus, as we serve the Lord in the Body, we must use our spirit to contact the Triune God John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the book of Ephesians, a book on the Body of Christ, Paul speaks of our regenerated human spirit in every chapter 1:17; 2:22; 3:16; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether we serve the Lord in preaching the gospel, offering a prayer, ministering the Word, visiting the saints, or calling a hymn in a meeting, we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By the exercise of our spirit we appropriate the Triune God every time we serve.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, we must serve by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The book of Acts reveals that the Christians in the early days of the church age served by prayer Acts 1:14, 24; 2:42; 3:1; 6:4; 10:2-4, 9; 11:5; 12:5; 13:1-3; 14:23; 16:25; 20:36; 28:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the only means used by them to carry out the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, we all need an appetite for prayer, for without prayer there is poverty in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need much prayer individually and corporately, never initiating or doing anything without it, and always praying in our spirit Eph 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today, we need the prevailing prayer which is of the Body, identified with the Body, and in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The concepts about service and the teachings concerning service that most Christians have received have become veils that frustrate their vision and confuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Very few have entered into the reality of the proper Christian service.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May the Lord take away all our veils and show us the vision portrayed in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May we all become those whose service is in the Body, in our spirit, and by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all must pray that in these days the Lord will gain this unique and genuine service in many localities throughout the world.</S>
