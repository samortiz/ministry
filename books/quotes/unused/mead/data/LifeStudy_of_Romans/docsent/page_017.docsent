   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE FOUR THE VANITY OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE TOTALITY OF HOPELESSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will cover the vanity of religion shown in the condemnation on the religious 2:17 3:8 and the totality of hopelessness shown in the condemnation of all the world 3:9-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have pointed out, Paul deals with condemnation in four aspects: on mankind in general, on the self-righteous in particular, on the religious specifically, and on all the world totally.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From these aspects of God s condemnation we can see four things: the source of wickedness, the way of restriction, the vanity of religion, and the totality of hopelessness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. THE CONDEMNATION ON THE RELIGIOUS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us first consider the vanity of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Human culture is the best human invention, and within this culture the foremost item is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Religion is the apex of man s culture.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Human culture needs religion, for without it culture is wild.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If religion were eliminated from human culture, culture would remain crude.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, most people respect religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among the human race the two best religions are Judaism and Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These are the typical religions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are genuine, sound, and fundamental religions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Both proceeded out of the same source, the divine revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Along with these two religions, we have Islam, a counterfeit of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Judaism was the source of Islam.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Koran, the sacred book of the Moslems, is actually an imitation of the Old Testament, although its contents have been changed in order to propagate lies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Koran even speaks about Christ, saying that He is greater than Mohammed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the Koran, Christ was never crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the people attempted to nail Him to the cross, angels descended and took Him away into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Koran even tells us that this Jesus will return.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is evident, therefore, that Islam and its sacred book, the Koran. are counterfeits.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Strictly speaking, besides Judaism, Christianity, and the counterfeit religion of Islam, there are no other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Buddhism is not a religion; it is nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A religion teaches people to worship God, but in Buddhism there is no God at all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You may ask about Confucianism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The teachings of Confucius are nonreligious; they are altogether ethical teachings, having nothing to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In his classical writings, Confucius probably mentioned God only once or twice, calling Him the Heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not consider Confucianism as a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On this earth there are just three religions the genuine religions of Judaism and Christianity and the counterfeit religion of Islam.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even with the two genuine religions there is still nothing but vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not need religion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not need something related to God; we need God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not need a way to worship God; we need the living Person of God to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When God gave us the Bible, He had no intention of giving us a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God s intention was to reveal Himself into us through the Holy Word, not to have a religious form.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, the ancient Jews formed a religion out of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then Christianity made a stronger religion because it has 27 books more than the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Jews had only 39 books to use in establishing a religion; Christianity has 66.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, Christianity has formed an even stronger religion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nevertheless, the stronger a religion is, the more vanity it contains.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I realize that I may offend some people in speaking this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The word Christianity is sweet and precious to the ears of many Christians, and it is offensive to them for a man to say that Christianity is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you are offended by this, it proves that you are exceedingly religious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I do not say that Christ is vanity and I do not say that Christians are vanity, but I assert strongly that Christianity is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Any anity is vanity, including churchanity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church is precious, but if you add anity to the church it becomes vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We want Christ, Christians, and the church, but we do not want any anity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not my teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we return to the pure Word in the New Testament, we find the term Christ and the term Christians Acts 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, the terms Christianity or Christmas are not in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A kind of anity or mas has been added to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christmas is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When people hang lamps on a little tree, that is anity and mas.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must beware of religion: religion is vanity.</S>
