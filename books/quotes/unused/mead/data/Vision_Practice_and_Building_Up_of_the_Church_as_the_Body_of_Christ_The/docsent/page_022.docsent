   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE MAIN ITEMS NEEDED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 3:14-17a; 4:1-6, 11-16 THE NEED FOR CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO MAKE HIS HOME IN OUR HEART</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In all of his writings, the apostle Paul gave us few examples of his prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the one short book of Ephesians, however, we have two prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before Paul spoke concerning the vision of the church what the church is and how God planned to produce the church he prayed for us, realizing that we need a spirit of revelation, an inner openness, so that we may see the eternal things 1:15-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the first prayer in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then after unveiling the vision of the church, he realized that this is not merely a matter to be understood, a matter in the mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He realized that we need the real experience of what we have seen in the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, he prayed a second time, in the last half of chapter 3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The main point of this prayer is that our inner man must be strengthened so that Christ may make His home not in our spirit but in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is the real need to stress this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today even among us there is a big shortage of knowing in our experience how to be strengthened into the inner man by the mighty Spirit of God so that Christ may make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our Need for the Salvation of Our Soul</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are regenerated in our spirit, and Christ has come into our spirit to dwell there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no argument as to whether or not Christ is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need not only to believe but to realize clearly that Christ is dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, this is only the regeneration of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are three steps in the application of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first step is regeneration, which is accomplished in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After this, we still have the problem of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament clearly reveals that we may be fully regenerated in our spirit yet still be soulish, natural, and darkened in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be soulish is to be earthly and even to be related to the demons, to be demon-like.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the New Testament tells us that after being regenerated in our spirit we need the salvation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our soul needs to be saved; it needs to be delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 10:39 speaks of the gaining of the soul, and 1 Peter 1:9 mentions the salvation of our souls.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>James 1 clearly tells us that we have been brought forth by the word of truth, but we still need the implanted, living word of God, which is able to save our souls vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>18, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After regeneration in the spirit, therefore, we need transformation in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our Need to Repent</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>by Turning Our Mind and Confessing</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we have seen, repent in Greek means to turn the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The mind is the leading part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we exercise our mind to turn to the Lord, our conscience follows, and we confess according to what the conscience perceives.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just as the mind is the leading part of the soul, the conscience is the leading part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, to repent and confess is to exercise our mind and our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we open our mind and open our conscience, the Lord has an open gateway to fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have said these things before, but we must repeat them again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are matters not merely in our human mentality but in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am concerned that it is easy to receive other teachings, but even if we repeat the above matters many times, we may still forget them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In actuality, it is not simply that we forget.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, the enemy snatches these things away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On many occasions when we try to point out these things to people, their thoughts are distracted right at the crucial moment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then when their attention returns, it is too late, and they receive no impression of them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why the New Testament indicates that not only the unbelievers but also the seeking, spiritual believers always need to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord commands most of the seven churches to repent 2:5, 16, 21; 3:3, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first word of preaching in the New Testament is to repent Matt 3:2; 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First John 1:9 also tells us to confess our sins, which implies repenting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To repent is to turn our mind to the Lord, and to confess is to exercise our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To repent and confess are to open our mind and conscience to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When our mind and conscience are open to the Lord, the gateway is open to Him, and He has the free way to fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then the Lord comes, not from without but from within, to spread Himself in us to saturate all the parts of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Romans 12:2 says, Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The way for our mind to be renewed is by being saturated by the Spirit with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we open ourselves to the Lord, He comes in to fill us, spreading from our spirit within into all the parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Jeremiah 31:33 calls these parts the inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All our inward parts will be saturated by the Spirit with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then our mind is renewed, and our will and emotion are also renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the parts of our soul will be renewed and saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In other words, all the parts of the soul will be occupied, taken over by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then Christ will settle down in all the parts of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the parts of the soul, plus the conscience of the spirit, compose the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, Christ is making His home in our heart Eph 3:17 .</S>
