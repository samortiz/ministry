   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ETERNAL FRESHNESS OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those in the Old Testament have died.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We shall, therefore, pay attention only to those in the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people push the cross back nineteen hundred years and consider it as old, outdated, and obsolete.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although it is true that world history considers Christ's Golgotha a historical event, in the believers' spiritual experience the cross of Christ is still a fresh event.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not old, outdated, or obsolete.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can consider a few verses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hebrews 10:19 and 20 say, "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to understand these two verses, we have to understand the things mentioned in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the ancient times, the tabernacle was divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first section was called the Holy Place, and the second section was called the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The two sections were divided by a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those entering the Holy of Holies had to pass through the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's glory was manifested within the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No ordinary person could enter the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only the high priest could enter it once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before he entered it, he had to first offer sacrifices and make atonement for himself and the people and had to go in with the blood of bulls and goats.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For us now, we enter the Holy of Holies through the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This signifies the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Formerly the high priest entered the Holy of Holies only once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now, through the cross of the Lord Jesus we can enter the Holy of Holies any time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is the meaning of entering the Holy of Holies?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It means that we can come to God to confess our sins, fellowship with Him, and be in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those entering the Holy of Holies had to pass through the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The veil signifies the body of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When He was crucified, the veil of the temple was rent in half from top to bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the veil had not been rent, men could not have passed through it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the Lord Jesus had not died and His body not been broken, men could not pass through Him and could not enter the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the present time, we come to God through the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This also signifies the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our Bible tells us that this way through the veil was opened up for us by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Truly, He willingly gave up His life to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to pay attention to the fact that this way is "new and living."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word "new" in the original language refers to something freshly offered or freshly sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here we see the eternal freshness of the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The high priest could not rely on the offerings or sacrifices of the previous years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He had to have fresh offerings and fresh sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He only dared to enter and was able to enter the Holy of Holies through the blood of these animals.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What about us now?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We come to God by the blood of the Lord and through His body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every time we come before God, we do not have to offer up sacrifices afresh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our Sacrifice is forever fresh!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus' cross does not turn old with the years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Its freshness is the same today and forever as it was at the time of crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every time we come before God, we can sense the freshness of the Lord's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the ancient times, unless the high priest had fresh blood of newly offered sacrifices, he would die before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The sacrifice of previous years could not redeem him from his current year's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If God did not consider the Lord's redemptive sacrifice as eternally fresh, we would have perished long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank the Lord that the cross is forever fresh before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord considers the crucifixion as something freshly accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This way is also "living."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This word can also be translated as "forever living."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This way is a way that is "freshly offered."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is also a way that is "forever living."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ has died and has resurrected; He has accomplished salvation for us and has led us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should know that Christ has resurrected and that His resurrection remains until today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should also know that Christ has died and that His substitutional death continues until today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The greatest events in the earthly life of Christ were His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Both are not past, obsolete events.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are still fresh today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since we have such a fresh, redeeming Savior, we should receive Him and come to God through Him to receive forgiveness and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Revelation 5 records how John saw the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He said, "And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain" v. 6 . This is a picture of the future.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When John saw the Lord in heaven, it was many years after Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yet the Lord was like One who had just been slain.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The words "having just been slain" can also be translated as "having been freshly slain."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In heaven at the time of the ushering in of eternity, the Lord will still be the One who is freshly slain!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Oh, the eternal freshness of the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Truly the cross passes through all ages and remains fresh!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If the cross will be fresh in heaven in that day, how can we consider it as being old today?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the future when the heavenly glory breaks forth, the glory of the cross will prove unfading!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When God's redeemed ascend to heaven, they will find the redemption of the cross still as fresh as before!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One point deserves our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the Old Testament Christ is twice called the Lamb Isa 53:7; Jer 11:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the Gospels and Acts He is mentioned as the Lamb three times John 1:29, 36; Acts 8:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the Epistles He is mentioned as the Lamb once 1 Pet 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, in Revelation He is mentioned as the Lamb twenty-eight times!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The glory of the Lord's cross will outshine all ages!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God purposely called His Son the Lamb in this book of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Lamb here is seen as having been freshly slain.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The wound is still there!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The eternal wound guarantees eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The crucifixion of the Lamb becomes our eternal memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God can never forget this.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The angels can never forget this, and those ascended and saved ones can never forget the redemption of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Who will receive this eternal salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The cross is the only unshakable place.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All those who have sinned should come.</S>
