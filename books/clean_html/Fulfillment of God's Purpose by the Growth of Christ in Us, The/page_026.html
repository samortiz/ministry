<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE GROWTH IN LIFE<br>FOR GOD'S BUILDING</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:6, 9-12; 1 Pet. 2:2, 5; Eph. 4:11-16; 2:20-22</H1><P>Life grows, transforms, saves, and renews for God's building. Thus, life builds up the church of God. The verses in the Scripture reading show that the growth of life is for the building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FIRST CORINTHIANS&#151;A BOOK TO THE LOCAL CHURCH</H2><P>First Corinthians was not written to individual believers or to the so-called church in the heavens. Paul said in 1:2 that this book was written to the church of God which was at Corinth, to the church in a locality, a local church. Thus, if we want to understand, to know, to realize, and to apprehend this book, we have to be in the local church. This is a book to the local church. Thank the Lord that we are in the local church, and we are positioned to receive this book. If we are in the right position, it is easy for us to see certain things. Because we are in the local church, it is easy for us to see a book written to the local church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PLANTING AND WATERING ON GOD'S FARM<br>FOR THE GROWTH IN LIFE TO PRODUCE<br>PRECIOUS MATERIAL BY THE TRANSFORMATION<br>IN LIFE FOR GOD'S BUILDING</H2><P>In this book Paul said that he planted, Apollos watered, and God made to grow (3:6). The planting, watering, and making to grow are not for individual believers. In 3:9 Paul said, "You are God's cultivated land [God's farm], God's building." The you in this verse is plural, not singular. The planting and the watering are for the farm. They are not for individuals but for the church, for the Body.</P><P>In today's Christianity nearly all the teachings are for individual believers. Christianity tries to create spiritual giants, but this is wrong. God has no intention of building up spiritual individuals. God's intention is to build up the local churches for the building up of the Body of Christ, God's farm, God's building. The planting and the watering are for the growth, and the growth is for the building. We are not only God's farm but also God's building. The farm comes first and then the building. This means the farm is for the building.</P><P>A farm is a plot of land for growing things. The church is God's land to grow Christ, not in an individual way, but in a corporate way. In the church we are the plants, planted by God to grow Christ. Something of Christ will be grown up in each of us. This is the farm of God, and the growth on this farm is for the building. It is by the growth that the material for the building is produced. To say that the church is God's farm and God's building seems very simple, but actually it is not that simple. The planting on the farm, of course, is related to the vegetable life. But eventually the growth of the plants issues in gold, silver, and precious stones (v. 12). How can the plants grow to produce gold, silver, and precious stones? The plants produce minerals.</P>
