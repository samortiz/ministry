   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let me share a living testimony with you.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After I had given some messages concerning taking Christ as our person, a sister testified that in the past she had difficulty going to sleep at night.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She used to pray earnestly, asking the Lord to help her go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But since she understood the real meaning of taking Christ as her person, she began to change her way of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She prayed in a simple way, saying, "Lord, do You want to sleep or not?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If You want to sleep, then I sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If You don't want to sleep, then I don't sleep."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She told us that after she prayed this way, she immediately went to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a good example of what it means to take Christ as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Recently, I checked with one of the young students.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I said, "Brother So-and-so, after tonight's meeting, you are going to take a bus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How would you pray?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He said, "I will pray, 'Lord, which bus should I take?'"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I told him that his prayer was a religious prayer and that it was wrong to pray that way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then I told him, "When you go out of the meeting hall, you need to have a little talk with the Lord, saying, 'Lord, which bus are You going to take?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If You take bus number one, I will take that too.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If You take bus number two, I will also take the same bus.'"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is so simple to take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not try to be holy, spiritual, or victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Forget about all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Always take Christ as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Always tell Him and tell the whole universe that now you are not living by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are living by Christ not only as your life but also as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I encourage all of you, the younger ones as well as the older ones, to try it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to be simplified.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have become complicated by Christian teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were taught that we should be holy, but we need to forget about this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, be so simple and go to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just tell Him, "O Lord, You are not only my life but also my person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am good and qualified for taking You as my person."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Wherever you are, whatever you do, and whatever you say, simply take Christ as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose tomorrow you plan to go to the beach.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You have to put this into practice and ask, "Lord, will You go to the beach tomorrow?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Lord, if You go, I will go.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If You do not go, neither will I. You are my person." It is so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we all take Christ as our person, spontaneously we will express God, and we will also subdue the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We will conquer all the enemies and have a conquering life, instead of a conquered life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Learn to practice taking Christ as your person in all the things in your daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In everything learn to take Christ as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not take this as a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Take this word and put it into practice in your daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then you will see how prevailing it is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you take Christ as your person, you will spontaneously express God and represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All day long the enemy will be under your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You will have a subduing life instead of a subdued life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means you will be victorious.</S>
