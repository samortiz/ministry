   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE CONTACTING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY DEMONSTRATING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible clearly reveals that God s purpose is to work Christ into His chosen people so that they might be the members of His Body, which, in this age, is expressed in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we have a heart to mean business with the Lord, then we must have a clear vision concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we speak of a vision concerning Christ, we do not mean Christ in a doctrinal or theological way; we mean Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must see a vision of the Christ whom we can experience fully in a very subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not need messages concerning the doctrine of Christ; we need Christ in our daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CHRIST, NOT RELIGION,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>BEING ACCEPTABLE TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you know what religion is?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Religion is something that is related to the things of God yet is without the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anything related to God and to the worship of God that does not have the experience of Christ is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In a sense, religion is quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not related to Satan, to sin, and to the world, but is related to God and even to the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is nothing wrong with Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, Judaism has a great lack the lack of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today s Christianity must also be categorized as a religion because it is related to God and to the worship of God yet in it there is very little experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you still cling to things that are good, scriptural, and related to God but that do not have in them the proper experience of Christ, then these things are a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God does not want religion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What God desires is Christ and something in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are not the orthodox Jews worshipping the true God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Certainly they are, for they worship God according to their Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, God rejects their worship because Christ is not in it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the Christ experienced by us in our worship and service will make our worship and service acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Christianity today there is a great deal of work and service, but there is very little Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a result, the work and service in Christianity are not so acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His eyes, it is not of much value.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever work we engage in must be with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without Christ, they mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not have Christ in our life, our life is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not have Christ in our service and worship, they are valueless to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must have Christ, not in doctrine or teaching, but in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have Christ in our experience, then whatever we are and do will be valuable in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s purpose is to work Christ into His chosen people so that they might become the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being a member of Christ requires life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every member of my body certainly shares the life of my body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Any part of my body that does not share the life of my body is not a member of my body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To say that we are the members of Christ means that we have the life of Christ and that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The very Christ who is in us makes us His members.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we lack Christ, we may be members of a society or of Christianity, but we cannot be members of the living Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every member of the living Body of Christ has Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Christ in us is not the Christ on the cross or the Christ in the heavens, but the subjective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE ISSUE OF OUR EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to God s governing principles and laws, everything in this universe has an issue.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we experience Christ in a subjective way, the issue will be the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No chapter of the New Testament is stronger than Ephesians 3 in speaking of the Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 8 Paul says, Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul does not say that he received grace in order to preach the doctrine of Christ, the theology of Christ, or the teaching of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, he received grace in order to preach the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without experience, we cannot taste of or participate in the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can only share in these riches by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The riches of Christ need our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In verse 17 Paul says that the Christ who is unsearchably rich is making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is this not a matter of experience?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Christ of the unsearchable riches is making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What is the issue of this?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is the church, which, at least twice in this chapter, is mentioned after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 10 says, To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This indicates that the riches of Christ produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The experience of the riches of Christ issues in the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, after speaking of Christ s making His home in our hearts v. 17 , Paul says that we shall be filled with all the fullness of God and that unto Him will be glory in the church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>19, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The church is the issue of the experience of Christ and comes out of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even our limited experience of Christ verifies this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we have a little experience of Christ, not in doctrine but in reality, we desire fellowship with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This fellowship is simply the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I have never met a Christian who has experienced Christ and yet who does not seek fellowship with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But I have met hundreds and even thousands of believers who, after having had some experience of Christ, are eager to be with other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If I meet Christ in the morning, this experience will send me to the church meeting in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many Christians today do not care for the church life because they do not have the real, genuine, and practical experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I was born, raised, and educated in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everything I was taught came from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But before I was saved and had the real experience of Christ, I had no desire to talk to the other so-called church members.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, from the day I was saved and Christ came into me, I enjoyed having fellowship with others about the Lord and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I liked talking with them and praying with them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This was the desire for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The more we experience Christ, the greater will be our desire for the church life.</S>
