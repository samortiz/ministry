<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO CARRY OUT<br />
THE PRIESTLY SERVICE</h1>
<p>Only those who serve as priests can be mingled with God, transformed, and built up in the flow of the divine life to be God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place. The riches of God flow through such believers and are expressed through them. Those who serve as priests have the image of God, and they represent Him in His authority. The priests are the only group of persons who can accomplish the desire of God&rsquo;s heart and fulfill His plan. The persons who are useful in God&rsquo;s plan are those who serve as priests. Now we will consider the way to live as a priest, that is, the way to carry out the priestly service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING IN THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>God is on the throne of grace (Heb. 4:16), and the throne of grace is equivalent to the expiation cover of the Ark in the Holy of Holies (Exo. 25:17). The Holy of Holies is the most sanctified place. It is separated fully unto God. It is the only place that is absolutely and solely for God. This point is clear in Old Testament typology. In the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle, there was only God on the throne of grace. Nearly every place in the universe has something other than God. There is not another place that is absolutely and solely for God and does not have anything other than Him. Hence, the Holy of Holies is the most holy place. God is in the most holy place.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR REGENERATED SPIRIT BEING<br />
THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>The Holy of Holies refers to God&rsquo;s habitation in heaven, which is the holiest place in the universe, and also to the regenerated human spirit. Hebrews 10:19-20, which speaks of the Holy of Holies, undoubtedly refers to our human spirit. These verses say that we have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies. The tone of these verses indicates that it is easy for us to enter the Holy of Holies at any time and in any place. This must refer to our spirit as the Holy of Holies. If the Holy of Holies were only in heaven, we would not be able to enter into it today.</p>
<p>God is Spirit (John 4:24). This is a mystery. Some believers might ask, &ldquo;How can God be in the Holy of Holies in heaven and at the same time be in the Holy of Holies in our spirit?&rdquo; With God there is not a problem with time or space. Our comprehension is limited by time and space because we are humans, but God does not have such a problem.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s ordination and arrangement, our spirit can contain only Him; our spirit cannot contain anything other than God. Our body and our soul can be occupied with many things, but our spirit is useful only to God. Our regenerated spirit is the most sanctified place in the universe. When God enters into us, He makes our spirit His habitation and dwells in our spirit. Hence, our spirit is the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BLOOD AND THE SPLIT VEIL ENABLING US<br />
TO ENTER INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>How can we enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, our spirit, to approach God? According to Hebrews 10:19-20, God has accomplished two things so that we may enter into the Holy of Holies with boldness. First, the Lord Jesus shed His blood for us. Through His blood we have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies (v. 19). In the beginning man was without sin and lived before God and fellowshipped with God in the garden of Eden. The tree of life, which signifies God, was also in the garden, indicating that man could contact God freely (Gen. 2:9). When man fell, the way to the tree of life immediately began to be guarded by the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned in every direction (3:24). This prevented sinful man from contacting the tree of life. The cherubim signify God&rsquo;s glory (Ezek. 9:3; Heb. 9:5), the flame signifies God&rsquo;s holiness (Deut. 4:24; Heb. 12:29), and the sword indicates God&rsquo;s righteousness (cf. Lam. 3:42-43; Rom. 2:5). This means that God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness prevent sinful man from contacting God. Sinful man cannot draw near to God or fellowship with God.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus died on the cross and shed His blood in order to satisfy the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness. Furthermore, His resurrection is proof that God was satisfied. Hence, wherever the Lord&rsquo;s blood is sprinkled, God&rsquo;s requirements are satisfied. Now sinners can approach God and contact Him with boldness through the blood of the Lord Jesus (Heb. 10:22).</p>
<p>Second, the Lord Jesus split the veil to the Holy of Holies, thus opening a new and living way so that we may pass through the veil and enter into the Holy of Holies (Matt. 27:50-51; Heb. 10:20). Not only do our sins prevent us from drawing near to God, but our fallen human nature, which the Bible refers to as the flesh, also prevents us from contacting God (Gen. 6:3). According to typology, the flesh, that is, the natural man, is a veil between God and man (Exo. 26:33; Heb. 10:20), which separates man from God and thus prevents man from contacting God. If this veil were not split, no one could enter into the Holy of Holies and contact God.</p>
<p>We thank God that the Lord Jesus died on the cross. Not only did He bear our sins and remove the barrier of sin, but He also put the flesh to death on the cross. When He died, the veil in the temple was split in two from top to bottom. This signifies that our fallen man was terminated on the cross. When the veil was split, the Lord opened a new and living way. Now there is no veil to separate man from God. Those who are joined to the Lord not only have the Lord&rsquo;s blood sprinkled on them; they also have His death on the cross applied to them. Under the sprinkling of His blood we can draw near to God. In His death we are delivered from the old creation and are no longer separated from God. On the one hand, we have the boldness to draw near to God, and on the other hand, we can come forward to God unhindered.</p>
