<p>I hope that those who serve the Lord full time will thoroughly study 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus with the outlines, footnotes, cross references, and Life-study messages. In these thirteen chapters of the Bible, we must find and study the crucial points concerning those who serve the Lord. These three books speak about the different conditions of the Lord&rsquo;s serving ones and give us the pattern of a serving one. Hence, we must not read them in a shallow way, nor should we simply pick up the points that appeal to us. Rather, we must study these books thoroughly, as if we had never read them before.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPROVING THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</h2>
<p>All the full-time serving ones must be approved by the responsible brothers in their respective localities (1 Cor. 16:3; 2 Tim. 2:15). For example, the full-time serving ones from Taipei must be approved by the church in Taipei, and the ones from Kaohsiung by the church in Kaohsiung.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Older Saints</h2>
<p> The full-time serving ones must be qualified in age. Many older brothers and sisters have been serving full time for many years, because after they retired, they consecrated their remaining days to the Lord&rsquo;s use. This is a good thing. There are also older sisters whose children are grown and married. These sisters can consecrate themselves and serve full time with the approval of the church. The only consideration for approving such saints is their age.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Young Saints</h2>
<p>We must also carefully consider the age of the younger brothers and sisters. We do not want any brothers and sisters who have not reached the age of twenty-one to serve full time. Human history proves that the years before the age of twenty are for receiving an education. In other words, we do not want the young full-time brothers and sisters to lack education. At a minimum, they need to graduate from a university or a college, and they must be over the age of twenty. We must consider the age and level of education of the young saints before we approve them.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we are running a worldly business, in which we must check the educational level of the saints. This is the age of education. Many people have at least graduated from junior college. How can we who serve the Lord have an education that is less than junior college? If our level of human knowledge is low, it will be difficult for us to contact people. It will also be difficult for us to expound the truth or preach the gospel. Therefore, a basic requirement for the full-time serving ones should be that they at least have a college education and that they are over the age of twenty.</p>
<p>When a local church considers the consecration slip of a young brother or sister who does not meet this standard, the church should encourage the brother or sister to get a minimum of a junior college education. If at all possible, they should obtain a degree from a four-year university. Furthermore, even if their age and level of education qualify them, there may be other factors. It may be that they have not fulfilled their military service, or they have to complete a teaching contract, or they have a contract with their employer. We must consider these matters. We should never give people the impression that we are dishonorable or that we do not keep our word or that we do not regard contracts. We should be positive, but we should not rush into the matter of serving full time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Working Saints</h2>
<p>With the working brothers and sisters, we must consider their careers. Suppose a brother is thirty-five years old and has only a high school education, but he is an electrician, and his business is very successful. It would not be appropriate for us to insist that he give up his job and serve full time. We should exhort such a brother to continue his business and to use his time after work to serve the Lord. This is good both for the brother and for the church. If he were to give up his profession, he would eventually become a burden to the church related to his support. This is not appropriate. It would be more profitable for this brother to remain in his profession and use his job as an opportunity to preach the gospel to people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Self-employed Saints</h2>
<p>A saint who is considering giving up his business to be completely for the Lord must understand that he is giving up an opportunity to use his business to preach the gospel. Many people have the opportunity to hear the gospel through the businesses of the saints. The saints should also consider their usefulness and function before the Lord. It may be that they do not need to spend that much time in their work. It would be better to advise the saints to remain in their businesses but not be usurped by them. We must encourage them to use their businesses as an opportunity to contact people, to preach the gospel, and to lead people to salvation. In this way they will not only be able to care for the needs of their own households, but they will also be able to make monetary contributions for the Lord&rsquo;s use. The churches must consider all these situations when approving saints to serve full time.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
