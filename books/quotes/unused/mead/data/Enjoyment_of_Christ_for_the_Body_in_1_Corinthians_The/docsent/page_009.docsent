   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR COMING BACK TO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PROPER GROUND OF ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND FELLOWSHIPPING TO ENJOY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE BODY-CHRIST Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 10-13a; 3:3-4; 12:18-27</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s purpose is to have the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 4:4 through 6 says, One Body and one Spirit...one Lord...one God and Father of all.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Triune God was consummated to be the Spirit for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we saw in the previous chapter, this Spirit, who is Christ Himself, becomes the Body-Christ 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 15:45b; 12:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>GOD PRESENTING HIMSELF TO US IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>IN THE FORM OF FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the clear revelation of the Bible, the Father is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 14 Philip asked the Lord Jesus, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord replied, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>8-10a .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the Lord s word to Philip, whoever sees the Son sees the Father also, because the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, the Son today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the life-giving Spirit is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is impossible for us to understand the mystery of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even we ourselves are a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all know that we have a body, but we also have a spirit and a soul 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We even have two hearts, a physical heart and a psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our physical heart may be sound and healthy, but our psychological heart is corrupt, rotten, and incurable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jeremiah 17:9 says, The heart is deceitful above all things, / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know where our physical heart is, but no one can locate our psychological heart our soul with our mind, emotion, and will, plus our conscience and no one can see our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is impossible to systemize all the wonderful, inward parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Lord s recovery we do not stress theological knowledge; rather, we stress the enjoyment of the Lord by our eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many theologians are foolish, thinking that they can understand the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more books they publish to define Him, the more confusion they cause.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we cannot understand a small mystery such as ourselves, how can we understand the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot even understand the food we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may not know the elements in various kinds of foods, but we know that we can receive these elements by eating and drinking the food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same way, the Triune God is not for our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is for our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jesus said, I am the bread of life, and He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me John 6:35a, 57b .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After God created man, He did not set up a seminary and charge Adam and Eve to diligently study the doctrines related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, God planted a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all know that a garden is for growing things to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Genesis 2:9 tells us that in the garden God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nothing in the garden was good for teaching; everything was good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, in the middle of the garden was the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, God Himself came in the flesh, presenting Himself to His creatures and saying, I am the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that the tree of life is simply Jesus, who is God Himself coming in the flesh to present Himself to man in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even today God does not present Himself mainly as the almighty One, commanding us to prostrate before Him and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, in presenting Himself to us, God makes Himself small.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever we eat is much smaller than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If something is bigger than we are, we cannot eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God does not come to us mainly as the One who is greater than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He comes to present Himself as food, as a small loaf, the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By so doing, God indicates that He wants us to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A popular hymn in Christianity says, How great Thou art.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we all need to praise Him by saying, How small Thou art.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is small enough for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the beginning of the Bible there is the tree of life, and at the end of the Bible is the final promise: Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life Rev 22:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The tree of life is God Himself as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We all need to realize that the Triune God is good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>EATING THE TRIUNE GOD ISSUING IN THE CHURCH, THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We also must see that when we eat the Triune God, there is a wonderful result, which is the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Body is the issue of our eating the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more we say, O Lord Jesus, the more we take the Lord into us, and the more we take Him in, the more He becomes us and we become Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As we eat Jesus, we are becoming Jesus in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This corporate Jesus is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Body-Christ comes out of our eating the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is true that we need to understand the Bible, but the enemy, Satan, has subtly deceived many Christians into thinking that the Bible is only for teaching and understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Jesus told the devil, Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God Matt 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This proves that, strictly speaking, the Bible is not for teaching but for nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should read the Bible not only to study it; we need to eat the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Jeremiah proclaimed, Your words were found and I ate them Jer 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is true that the Bible is the revelation of God, but again the enemy uses this concept in a subtle way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Bible is not only the revelation of God but also the breath of God, as is confirmed by Paul s word in 2 Timothy 3:16: All Scripture is God-breathed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Bible is the breathing out of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What He breathes out, we must breathe in.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The principle of eating is simply to take something that is outside of us into our being, digest it, and assimilate it into our organic tissues to make it our own element.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To eat God, therefore, is to take God into our being and assimilate what He is into our basic structure, our organic inner being, to make us what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God can be assimilated into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We need to tell people the wonderful fact that as human beings who have eaten, digested, and assimilated the Triune God, we now have the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Moreover, since we have the divine element in a corporate way, we are the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The proper church life, the Body-Christ, comes out of our eating the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is a wonderful and marvelous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is God s intention, desire, and eternal purpose Eph 3:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>How subtle the enemy of God is!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The old serpent has crept in deceitfully to deaden the living of the believers and cause divisions through differing teachings and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is why in today s Christianity we do not see the Body-Christ, the corporate Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Instead, what we see are many divisions.</S>
