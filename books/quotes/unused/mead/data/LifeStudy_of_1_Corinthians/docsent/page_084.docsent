   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR WORK TO BE TESTED BY FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 3:13-15 Paul says, The work of each shall become manifest; for the day shall make it known, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will test each one s work, of what sort it is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If anyone s work which he has built upon it shall remain, he shall receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If anyone s work shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but he shall be saved, yet so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, our building work will be tested by His holy fire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only the gold, silver, and precious stones will be able to withstand the fire and pass this test.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Anything of wood, grass, or stubble will be consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If our work is able to pass the test of fire, we shall receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the teaching of the New Testament, this reward will be the enjoyment of the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To the faithful ones the Lord Jesus will say, Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your Lord Matt 25:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, if our work is consumed by the fire, we shall suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This definitely does not mean that we shall lose our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our salvation is eternal and cannot be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But these verses indicate that we may lose the reward and yet be saved through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a serious warning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>APPLYING PAUL S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to apply Paul s word about taking heed how we build on the unique foundation to the situation among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is very common to find Christians doing one of two things: laying another foundation in place of Christ, or building with wood, grass, and stubble, that is, with their nature, their being, and their doings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thousands of foundations have been laid by Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Virtually every Christian group has its own kind of foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is very common for Christian workers to lay other foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, a certain leader and his co-workers may form a particular organization.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In doing so they are laying another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is also common for Christians today to build with wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The result is that the Lord does not get the proper building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, there is no way for Him to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, one day He will come back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you think that when the Lord Jesus comes back most believers will have a large amount of gold, silver, and precious stones?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The precious materials will, no doubt, be small in quantity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But there will certainly be a vast amount of wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Among today s Christians there is an abundance of natural things, but very little of the precious materials suitable for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, at the time of the Lord s coming back to test our work, many will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some, however, will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I earnestly hope that you will not take these messages merely in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not adequate to learn all the points and then repeat them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is needed is that we digest the messages and have our eyes opened to see the revelation in these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we shall be able to utter something in a way that is experiential and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We desperately need to see that God s goal is to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First the church must be God s farm with all the believers as plants growing in life to produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, by the growth in life we shall be transformed and become precious materials gold, silver, and precious stones for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all must heed the warning of not to lay another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ, the unique foundation, has already been laid.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Lord s recovery we already have the proper foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, there is no need to initiate anything or to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, we should not exalt anyone or have a preference for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead, we must take Christ, the all-inclusive One, as the foundation and build on Him, not with our nature, being, or doings, but with the nature of God, the redemptive work of the Son, and the transforming work of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If by the mingled spirit we build with these precious materials, we shall be carrying on a proper work for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result, when the Lord comes back, our work will pass the test, and we shall receive the reward to enjoy the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If our work is done in Christ, with Christ, for Christ, and is even Christ Himself, it will pass the test of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Otherwise, if we build with material that can be consumed, we shall lose the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Oh, may we all see this truth!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This will bring us into the depths of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It will cause us to realize where we are and to know that the recovery is not an ordinary Christian work or a repetition of the history of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord s recovery is to bring us back to Christ, the depths of God, that God may have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Let us all look to the Lord that we may receive mercy to see this marvelous vision.</S>
