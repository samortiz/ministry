   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE TYPES OF ANTICHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Antiochus Epiphanes was a type of Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first type of Antichrist was Nimrod in Genesis; the second was Antiochus Epiphanes in Daniel; and the third was Titus, the prince of Rome who destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, if we want a full picture of Antichrist, we need to study not only the book of Revelation but also these three types of Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With Nimrod, Antiochus Epiphanes, and Titus we have the picture, and in the book of Revelation we have the definition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we put together the picture and the definition, we have a full view concerning Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE CONTROLLING VISION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>KEEPING GOD'S PEOPLE FROM THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I hope that we will all see the controlling vision in the second chapter of Daniel and that, in light of this vision, we will have a clear view regarding human government.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the eyes of human beings, there are different kinds of governments, some good and others bad.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in the eyes of God, every human government is a beast.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Babylon, Persia, Greece, the Roman Empire all are beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I can testify that this view has preserved me from the world for more than sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need such a view, such a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If, as God's people, we see this controlling vision, we will be kept from the world and prepared for Christ's coming as the smiting stone which will crush the aggregate of human government and become a great mountain the eternal kingdom of God filling the whole earth.</S>
