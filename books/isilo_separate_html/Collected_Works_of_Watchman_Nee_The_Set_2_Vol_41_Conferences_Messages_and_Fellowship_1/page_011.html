At that time the Old Testament had been translated into Greek. Although there were Old Testament apocryphal writings, the Lord did not acknowledge them. The Lord only acknowledged the Old Testament that we have today. We find the proof of this in Luke 24:44. Hence, there is absolutely no error in the Old Testament, and no part was missing.</p><p>The New Testament: There are only three extant manuscripts of the New Testament: the Vaticanus, the Siniaticus, and the Alexandrianus. Historically, there are four to five hundred copies of parts of the four gospels in existence. The New Testament does not have an apocrypha, and no part of it has been lost.</p><p>John Calvin said that in reading the Apocrypha, his spirit spontaneously told him that it was not inspired by the Spirit.</p><p>Dr. Scofield said that it is all right if the Bible has one part in ten thousand that is in error, because that one part has nothing to do with the truth of the Bible.</p><h2 class="head2">The Order of the Four Gospels (August 2)</h2><p>The first three gospels were written in Judea, whereas the Gospel of John was written in Ephesus. Mark and John were written chronologically; Matthew was written according to the order of doctrines, whereas Luke was written according to the order of spiritual teachings.</p><h2 class="head2">Comments on Matthew (August 2)</h2><p>The good earth in Matthew 13:8 refers to a good heart, an honest heart. The Holy Spirit is the comforter. A comforter is one who is alongside. During the three and a half years that the Lord was on the earth, He was first a Friend to sinners. He did not come first to be the Savior. He was first a Friend to sinners and then the Savior to sinners. He first had to be a Friend before men could love Him. The Lord did this to prepare men's hearts to receive Him as the Savior. People often do not believe when we talk to them about repentance and faith in God. We should first let the sinners know that the Lord is their Friend. Then they will easily receive Him as their Savior.</p><p>The casting of the net and the collecting of the fish in Matthew 13 portray the things in the coming kingdom (vv. 47-48).</p><p>The Lord had three kinds of brothers: those in the flesh, the Jews, and the New Testament believers.</p><h2 class="head2">The Spreading in Acts (August 2)</h2><p>The church committed one grave mistake after Pentecost&mdash;it did not follow the commandment of Acts 1:8. After Acts 9, we have a record of Paul as a messenger of the gospel to the Gentiles. Yet before Paul went out for his work, Peter had already gone down to Caesarea. His going to Caesarea was opposed by the believers in Jerusalem. However, without Peter's going, it is doubtful whether Paul could have started a work there at a later date.</p><h2 class="head2">Romans 2:12 (August 2)</h2><p>According to Romans 2:12, those who have never heard the gospel will not necessarily perish. When I was in Canada, I preached on the subject of "Seven Kinds of People Who Can Be Saved without Believing or Knowing the Truth." Among those who can be saved are those who do not know that there is a God, those who do not know that Jesus is the Savior, and those who do not know of the forgiveness of the cross.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
