   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S DESIRE TO DWELL AMONG US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to 29:29-46, the conclusion of chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even though we may now understand the steps in sanctifying Aaron and his sons to be priests, we may not understand how to apply these steps to the conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other words, we may not realize that these chapters have a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the goal of Exodus 28 and 29?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some may think that the goal is to sanctify God s redeemed ones to be His priests.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, this sanctification is a procedure; it is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I realize that it is not easy to understand the goal of Exodus 28 and 29.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only do we find it difficult to grasp the significance of certain parts of the Bible; we have the same difficulty in reading spiritual books or even in reading a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Recently, I received a letter from a believer who told me how much he had been helped by The Economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He further told me that he had devoured a number of other books put out by the Living Stream Ministry and had been nourished and helped by them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, his letter indicated that actually he did not have the proper understanding of much of what he had read.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is an illustration of our difficulty in understanding spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, my speaking is often repetitious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to have certain things repeated again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible itself is often repetitious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For instance, in the New Testament we are told repeatedly to believe in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How many times does the New Testament charge us to believe in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There can be no doubt that this is repeated again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The reason for such repetition is that we have dull, stubborn ears.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We hear, yet we often do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let me ask once again, what is the goal of chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine of Exodus?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have pointed out, the goal is found in 29:42b-46.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This goal is God s coming to speak with us, to meet with us, and to dwell among us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God does not want merely to pay us a visit; He desires to dwell among us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 42 says that the Lord will meet with us and speak with us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verses 45 and 46 the Lord says that He will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God first says that He will meet with us, then that He will speak with us, and eventually that He will dwell in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that God s dwelling among us depends on His speaking to us and on our speaking to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, it depends on the conversation between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our speaking may keep Him away, or it may encourage Him to dwell with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In these verses God seems to be saying, I want to dwell with you and not just visit with you for a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My intention is to dwell among you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, I want to come to you and talk with you to see how you are and where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My desire is to have among you a tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The tents in which you dwell are not the tent of meeting, but My tent, the tabernacle, is the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The goal of having the priestly garments, the priestly food, and even the food offered to Me is that I may meet with you and dwell among you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>INVITING GOD TO DINNER</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I would like to use an everyday illustration to impress you with the significance of the goal of Exodus 28 and 29 as revealed in 29:42b-46.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These chapters actually tell us how to invite God to dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From our experience of being invited to dinner or of inviting others to our home for dinner, we can understand something of what it means to invite God to dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Often saints have asked me to give them a time for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On a number of occasions, I had to tell them that I could not spare the time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Their strategy then was to invite me to their home for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually, it was not their intention to feed me a good meal out of love; it was to create an opportunity to have a time to speak with me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They knew that if I accepted the invitation to dinner, they would have the time they were seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, their invitation was their strategy to have time alone with me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The point here is that by inviting someone to your home for a meal, you give that person the opportunity to open himself to you and to have fellowship with you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the matter of inviting God to come to dinner, there is no need for strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God is very willing to accept our invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In fact, He Himself has proposed that we invite Him to dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine of Exodus reveal that God wants us to invite Him to dinner, that He wants to come and eat with us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, in order for Him to come, we need to make the necessary preparations.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Preparing to have dinner with God can be illustrated by the Chinese custom of preparing to receive an honored guest for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First, the hosts need to bathe, get a haircut if necessary, and dress in their best clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Also, the house must be thoroughly cleaned, and the yard must be swept.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If such preparations are not made, the hosts would despise their honorable guest.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more honorable the guest, the more complete and thorough the preparation must be.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It may even be necessary to freshly paint certain parts of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then, of course, the best food must be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This preparation should involve a variety of food: fruit, vegetables, fish, fowl, and meat.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There would be the need for both salt-water fish and fresh-water fish.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, there should be some imported foods, famous foods from places far away, even from other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All these food items would then be put together in preparing a feast for the honored guest.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The host has a goal in issuing an invitation to an honored guest and in making thorough preparations.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This goal is that, while enjoying the feast, the honored guest will be induced to open himself and speak freely with the host and his family.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the honored guest engages in a conversation in such a way, the host will be happy, considering that it was worthwhile to spend so much time and money to prepare for that occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He had attained his purpose in inviting that honored guest to his home for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This illustration helps us to understand Exodus 28 and 29.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In these chapters the priests are the hosts, the ones inviting the honored guest.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They are sanctified in order to receive this guest for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Aaron, the high priest, is like the father in the host family, and his sons, the priests, may be compared to the children in this family.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All together they are serving the Lord as their honorable guest.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All the steps of their sanctification are for the purpose of having the Lord come to dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In this country some who invite a guest for dinner may not be thoroughly prepared when the time comes to receive their guest.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For example, they may not be wearing proper shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But according to Exodus 28 and 29 and the illustration given above, we should be washed and properly covered.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I use this illustration to show that these two chapters reveal the proper way to invite God to come to dwell with us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>His coming, speaking, and dwelling are related to our eating together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When people share a meal together, they often converse in a loving, intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is also true of God s meeting with us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>GOD DRINKS</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Recently it has occurred to me that, according to the Bible, God drinks.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I have even been considering the need for a tract entitled God Drinks.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Exodus 29:40 and 41 mention the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This drink offering was not for the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Rather, it was altogether for God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Thus, because the drink offering was poured out for God, we can rightly say that God drinks.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Not only does God eat, but He also drinks!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>According to Exodus 29, we should not only serve God with food, but we should also give Him something to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We need to pour out the drink offering for Him to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Eventually, we should serve Him with both food and the wine of the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>THE GOAL OF SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Have you ever imagined that Exodus 28 and 29 reveal the proper way to invite God for dinner?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>These chapters reveal what we must do to have God meet with us, speak with us, eat with us, and, eventually, dwell among us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is the goal of the sanctification of Aaron and his sons to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Suppose a Chinese family is preparing to have an honored guest for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>While they are busy cleaning the house, sweeping the yard, and cooking the food, others may ask them what they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Certainly the members of this family would not say that all this preparation is an end in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>No, the goal of cleaning is not cleaning, and the goal of cooking is not cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The reason for all this preparation is that an honored guest is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Those in this family may say, Do you know why we are so busy cleaning, sweeping, and cooking?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The reason is that the mayor is coming for dinner tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The goal of all their preparation is to receive such an honored guest.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In like manner, we have a goal in being washed and clothed.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Our goal is to receive God for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Why do we need to be sanctified to serve God as priests?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We need all the steps of sanctification because God is coming for dinner, and we must be ready to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Furthermore, we shall eat with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When we have a guest in our home, on the one hand, we serve him, and, on the other hand, we eat with him.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>First we give the guest the best portion of the food, and then we all enjoy the meal together.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We also give the honored guest something to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Our goal is that our guest, the Lord Himself, will then open Himself to us, speak freely with us, and then decide to stay with us and dwell with us.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Is this not a wonderful exposition of Exodus 28 and 29?</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If we see this goal, the reason for all the steps in the sanctification of the priests, we shall understand what is revealed in these chapters.</S>
