<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. SAUL'S RASH OATH</H2><P>Verses 24 through 46 are concerned with the matter of Saul's rash oath. A strong person is often rash.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Cursing Any Man Who Ate Food<br>before the Evening</H2><P>In the oath he laid on the people, Saul cursed any man who ate food before the evening, when Saul would be avenged of his enemies (vv. 24-26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jonathan Not Hearing His Father's Oath<br>and Eating Some Honey</H2><P>Jonathan did not hear his father's oath and ate some honey (vv. 27-30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The People of Israel Eating<br>the Sheep, Oxen, and Calves with the Blood</H2><P>The people of Israel ate the sheep, oxen, and calves with the blood (vv. 31-35). They did this because of the heavy blitz on the Philistines and Saul's rash oath. Saul corrected the people in that sin and asked them to slay their oxen and sheep and eat before him that night. Then Saul built his first altar to Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jonathan's Breaking<br>of His Father's Oath Being Caught</H2><P>Jonathan's breaking of his father's oath was caught (vv. 36-46). Saul sought God's leading for him and the people of Israel to pursue after the Philistines, and God did not answer him that day (vv. 36-37). Following this, Jonathan's death crime was found out (vv. 38-44). When Saul said that Jonathan would die, the people vindicated Jonathan and saved him from the death crime (v. 45). Then Saul went up from following the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to their own place (v. 46).</P>
