   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the church is the hidden mystery in God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now in this message we shall begin to consider the revelation of the mystery of Christ the church .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. By Christ</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The revelation of the church as the mystery of Christ is completed in two steps that involve the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Godhead the Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the source, the Father has all the revelation, but He Himself does not give this revelation directly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, the divine revelation is first given through the Son and then through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the first step in giving the revelation of the church, which is the mystery of Christ, is by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Gospels</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The revelation of the church is given by Christ in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, many readers of the New Testament have not seen in the Gospels the revelation of Christ as the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Neither have they seen the revelation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To the First Group of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The revelation of the church by Christ in the Gospels was given to the first group of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The First Time in Matthew 16:15-20</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first time the church was revealed by Christ was in Matthew 16:15-20.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we shall see the second time was in Matthew 18:15-20. a. Concerning the Universal Church</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus says, "I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here in the Lord's first mentioning of the church, what is revealed is the universal church for the unique testimony of the Lord in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the universal aspect the church is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The end of Ephesians 1 speaks of the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ has only one Body, which is unique in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ created the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers in Himself into one new man, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the church as the new man is universal and one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The words "My church" in Matthew 16:18 indicate that the church is of the Lord, not of any person or thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is not like the denominations, which are denominated after some person's name or according to some thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church Christ is building is the universal church, not the church in a nation or the church in a city.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church in Matthew 16:18 is the universal church, the one church in the entire universe.</S>
