   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Bible only makes a distinction between "believing" and "not believing."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible does not know what an incomplete faith means.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should know that there is no merit in our believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God does not save us because we have attained the merit of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This cannot be farther from the truth!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To believe is to receive John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>John 3:16 says that God "gave" us His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we "receive" Him, everything is done.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One gives and the other receives.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no merit of the sinner involved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Salvation is fully accomplished by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who among us is not a sinner?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were dead in trespasses and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How pitiful we were!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Holy Spirit came and caused us to realize our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How terrible is the punishment for sin!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One cannot help but tremble at the thought of the future.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is all the more pitiful when we realize that there is no way for us to save ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were wallowing in the mud and yet had no way to rescue ourselves!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What an unspeakable deprivation!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thank and praise the slaughtered Lamb!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He came and died for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He stood on the ground of us the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He loved us and gave Himself for us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While we were yet sinners, He died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He accomplished the salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When He died, He proclaimed, "It is finished!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How precious is this word!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I can never thank You enough for Your great grace!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To believe in the Lord Jesus means nothing other than a willingness on the part of us, the helpless and destitute sinners, to be saved by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He came to save, and when we are willing to be saved, the matter is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no question of complete or incomplete faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He says Himself, "Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" John 6:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since we have come, there is now only one question: "Has He cast me out?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Praise God, for Christ is faithful and trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no guile found in His mouth!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He will never cast out those who come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will save all those who realize their sins and who will accept Him as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest" Matt 11:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink" John 7:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the Lord's invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers, it is not just our faith that is saving us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, it is His grace and faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God desires to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He will bestow grace on us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Will we not believe?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What else is there to doubt?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord's love should fill our hearts and should drive out all drifting thoughts!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After some have understood this teaching, they may have a doubt in them: "If a man already knows that he is saved and has eternal life and is guaranteed heaven, will he not then sin at will?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Will he not think that he is saved anyway and that he can, therefore, unbridle his lusts and sin at will?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Will he not think that he is saved now, and that it does not matter anymore if he sins again?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is only a hypothesis.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many people think that if they know that they are saved, they will still want to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But this is only a hypothesis.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In reality, something exactly opposite happens.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a man knows that he is saved, he will not want to sin anymore, and he will also bear heavenly characteristics in his thought and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I can give you an illustration here.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today in China we are sending a few hundred people to study abroad every year.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Most of them go to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Suppose there is a father who wants to send his son to America.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How should the son be dressed?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Should he pay attention to the Chinese gowns and consider the latest fashion?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Does he need to study Chinese etiquette and manners?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Does he need to know all the things associated with the Chinese culture?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Surely he does not.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is about to go to America.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He does not need to know more about China, but he needs to learn the customs and fashions of the other country.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He should learn to eat with a fork and knife, to shake hands, and to doff his hat.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He should study in detail the tastes, likes and dislikes, and individual habits of the Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He should study the mind and characteristics of the Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When he speaks in English, he should have an American accent with it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When he walks, he should walk like the Americans walk.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He should pursue after American fashion in his dress and attire.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In other words, all those who are about to go to America have a natural tendency to act and move like an American.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If a believer realizes that he has eternal life already, and is a citizen of heaven, he will surely learn the heavenly pattern in everything, in word, conduct, and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those who do not know that they are saved will imitate the world and try to be conformed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Brothers, there is no danger of sinning carelessly for those who know that they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>On the contrary, those who know this will set their minds daily on the things which are above.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This can be fully confirmed by the spiritual experiences of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Just like those who are going to America try to be Americans, those who are going heavenward will surely learn to be heavenly persons.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Dear brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ already.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the most important thing on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is also the greatest blessing in eternity for man!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You should know that the Lord has saved you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What a comfort and joy it is for us to know that we are persons with eternal life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>"Rejoice that your names are recorded in the heavens" Luke 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What a precious message!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is indeed the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We can know that we are saved in this age!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Formerly we were the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Now we have received grace.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Should we not rejoice?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>What gratitude and affection we have to realize that the Lord has saved us from perdition and has given us eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we know this, we will praise God all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We know that we cannot save ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>As a result, all the authority, riches, wisdom, power, honor, glory, and praise be unto the slain Lamb for now and evermore!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Now you can see how much God loves us!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Since He has loved us and saved us, we should love Him out of a sense of gratitude and should live as saved persons on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Since He has begun the good work in our heart, He will surely complete this work until the day of Christ Jesus Phil 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We cannot please Him by ourselves, because "those who are in the flesh cannot please God" Rom 8:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We can only allow His Spirit to work in us to effect a holy living.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Although sometimes we may unfortunately fail, this does not mean that we will perish again.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>What the Lord has given us is an eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When we fail, we should not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We should rise up and ask for the Lord's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He will surely lead us on.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Once I was preaching in a place.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>After a brother there understood this truth, he said to me, "I did not know before that I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>As a result, I lived carelessly in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I was afraid that if I gave up everything in this life for the Lord, and then the Lord apportioned me perdition at the time of the judgment, I would as the saying goes, lose one's case before both the magistrate and the mandarin.'</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I was afraid that I would have neither the joy of this world, nor the blessing of heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But now that I know this truth, heaven is guaranteed.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Since I am a citizen of heaven already, I do not want to live foolishly in this world anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Indeed, if we know that our life is hid with Christ in God, we will surely set our mind on the things above.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We have a wonderful Savior, and we have received a wonderful salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Is this not a cause for joy?</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Let us sing Hallelujah!</S>
