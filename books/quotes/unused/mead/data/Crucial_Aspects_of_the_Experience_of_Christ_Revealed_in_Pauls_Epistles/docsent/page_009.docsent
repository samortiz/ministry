   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS Scripture Reading: Eph 3:4, 8-10, 16-19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to see a vision of the mystery of God and the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church Col 2:2; Eph 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, Christ and the church are the great mystery 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God, who is a mystery, has been embodied in Christ and is therefore expressed through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whatever God is, is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To see, touch, and gain Christ is to see, touch, and gain God, for Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ, who is also a mystery, is embodied in the church, just as God is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To touch or be in the church is to touch or be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The secret of the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this chapter we will consider the mystery of Christ making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For Christ to make His home in our heart is more particular than for Him to be with us in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our heart is not merely something in our environment or even something very close to us but the center and content of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, Christ making His home in our heart is not an outward or superficial matter but is something deep in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This matter also concerns the real church life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church is Christ making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Ephesians 3 there are several great matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 3 says, By revelation the mystery was made known to me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This mystery is deep and great, yet it is has been revealed to us and even revealed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Colossians 1:26-27 says, The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mystery is Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ today is subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is not only near us but also within us, in the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is indeed mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unbelievers do not understand why Christians are virtuous and joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>People may wonder what the source of strength and power is that enables Christians to endure sufferings or to love when others cannot love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a mystery to them, but it has been revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We know that the source of our life and power is Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The indwelling Christ is the secret of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Another great matter revealed in Ephesians 3 is the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 8 the apostle Paul says, To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul did not preach doctrine or a gospel of theology but the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to see some of the items of the unsearchable riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, the unsearchable riches of Christ include God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to receive God, we must receive Christ, for God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The second item of Christ s riches is life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Life, which is precious and crucial, is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to receive life, we must receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The third item of Christ s riches is His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As human beings, we have many defects and imperfections, but Christ, who is also a man, does not have any defects.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His perfection is absolute; He is the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to have a proper humanity, we must have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we have Christ, we have God, life, humanity, and many other items.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The apostle Paul preached these items.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By God s mercy and grace we are doing the same thing today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Lord s recovery we do not preach doctrine or theology but Christ, a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We minister a rich Christ, a Christ full of unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE ECONOMY OF THE MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The third great matter in Ephesians 3 is the economy of the mystery in verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>An economy is a dispensing, a distribution of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The apostle Paul was doing a particular kind of work he was distributing Christ in His riches into people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As genuine Christians, we can testify that since the day we first called on the name of the Lord, something mysterious has been added into our being; Christ has been dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The mystery of Christ is Christ experienced in all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To experience the riches of Christ means that something of Christ, some element of His riches, has been dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this way, we experience and enjoy Christ as our life, life supply, support, and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more we experience Christ, the more He is dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The dispensing of His riches into us is the economy of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Something eternal, mysterious, and incomprehensible yet sweet, rich, and high has been dispensed into our being and makes us joyful, living, powerful, loving, and lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every believer has Christ within.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once we receive Christ, we can never send Him away.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may sometimes try to reject Him, but we cannot get rid of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may even say, Lord, I do not love You, but He will say, I still love you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The more we talk to the Lord, even in this way, the more of Christ we will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Instead of resisting the Lord, we should simply love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Loving the Lord and being loved by Him is the reason that Christians may appear to be crazy to others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Saints often travel from a long distance to come to church conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At the conferences we only attend meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We do not come for entertainment, yet we are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Unbelievers cannot understand our joy and may think that we are superstitious or misled, but the real reason is that we have the dispensing of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Saints from many different nations meet together in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Naturally speaking, Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans cannot love one another, just as the Germans, French, and British cannot love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, when we see the other saints, regardless of their nationality, we spontaneously love them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The reason and motive for our mutual love is not that we know each other well but that something within each of us corresponds to something within the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even if we cannot understand one another s language, we love one another because we experience the dispensing of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The first time that I went into a Japanese home was in 1933 when I was invited to visit a group of Japanese Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When I went into the home, they were all kneeling and praying on a traditional Japanese tatami mat.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Right away I took off my shoes and crawled onto the mat to join them in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I was happy to fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I loved them, and they loved me.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The reason for this love is the dispensing of the mystery.</S>
