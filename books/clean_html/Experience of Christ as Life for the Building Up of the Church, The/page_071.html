<P>I do not want to disappoint or discourage the young people, but I must say that with the young ones it is hard to have a ministry. We cannot expect a young sprout to bring forth fruit. To bring forth fruit a person needs maturity, and the maturity comes into being through sufferings. We need the young ones in the church life, but we need the mature ones even more. We need those who have some ministry which comes into being through all kinds of sufferings. This is not a teaching gift, not a speaking gift, but a life-producing ministry.</P><P>Second Corinthians 4 speaks of how the outer man has to be consumed, broken, and reduced all the time (v. 16). The outer man cannot be fully reduced in a short time. Soon after I was saved by the Lord in 1925, I thought that if I could pray much for one or two years, I would become very spiritual. Now, many years later, my feeling is that there is still too much of the oldness of the outer man with me. We all need to enter into the full sonship. We have the foretaste for our enjoyment today, and we are waiting for the full sonship, which is the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). To have our old man decreased, reduced, and consumed is a slow process.</P><P>The young people have many dreams of being somebody in the spiritual realm. One young person expected to be a great evangelist, but instead he became a big backslider. I love the young people, but we need to realize that they are not so trustworthy because they are in their dreams. They need the experiences of Christ through sufferings.</P><P>In 2 Corinthians the apostle Paul did not tell us how much he could do or what kind of gift he had. When he commended himself as a minister of Christ, he did not say that he had the biggest gift or that he was a great speaker, preacher, or Bible expositor. Instead, in chapter eleven he commended himself as a minister of Christ by speaking of his sufferings in following the Lord (vv. 16-33). He even said that five times under the hands of the Jews he received forty stripes less one (v. 24). I do not believe that we would write such a letter to the saints. We would want to speak only about the wonderful aspects of Christ, not about the beatings we suffered. Paul even mentioned the sufferings and perils he experienced in his journeys. He spoke of being in dangers among false brothers (v. 26).</P><P>We may wonder why the Lord would allow such a great servant of His to suffer so much. This is because the ministry is produced through sufferings. I hope that the Lord comes back soon, but it may be that He will delay His coming just because of us. We may say that we love the Lord and that the Lord will bless us. Surely He will bless us, but what do we mean when we say this? Our dictionary is different from the Lord's dictionary. The Lord does desire to bless us, but His blessing us is according to the meaning in His heavenly dictionary. Without the sufferings, we cannot experience the Lord as our blessing in a rich way. The chorus of Hymns, #626 says, "Each blow I suffer/Is true gain to me./In the place of what Thou takest/Thou dost give Thyself to me." Every blow takes away something of ourselves and brings in something of the Lord. We should like this kind of trade. He takes away a part of our old man and gives back to us something of Himself.</P>
