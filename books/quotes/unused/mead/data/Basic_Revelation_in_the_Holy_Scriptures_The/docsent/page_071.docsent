   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Composed of the Living Members of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians consider the church a physical building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They refer to the building as the church or as the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many think of a church as a building with a steep roof, stained-glass windows, and a bell tower.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible, however, reveals that the church is a living composition of the living members of Christ 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is an organic composition of all real believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not a lifeless building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is we, you and I, the persons regenerated by the Spirit with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is all the dear saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is living and alive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not lifeless, for the components of the church are living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We the believers are the components.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is composed of all the saints, so it is something living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Church Humanity and Divinity</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is also a corporate person composed of the two elements of humanity and divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We the believers as the components of the church have two natures a human nature and a divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We received our human nature by our natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then in our second birth, a spiritual birth, we received another nature, the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At our regeneration we received the divine life 1 John 5:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have life, surely with that life goes the nature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are partakers of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 : therefore, we have two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a trend today among seminary students to believe that Christians have only one nature, which will be gradually improved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not only a wrong teaching; it is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a teaching annuls the fact of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church, however, is a living, corporate composition of people with two natures human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With Christ there was divinity first, then humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With us there is humanity first, then divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ as the tabernacle was a person with divinity plus humanity, and we, as the enlargement of Christ, God's dwelling place, the very temple, are a composition of first humanity and then divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ has divinity plus humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have humanity plus divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In nature He and we are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The only difference is that He has the Godhead, and we do not; yet we do have the divine life and nature as He does.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not have His headship, His deity.</S>
