   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The garment on which the blood of the sin offering was spattered was washed in a holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This signifies that the daily life of one who has received redemption through the blood of Christ as the sin offering should be dealt with in a separated, sanctified realm.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From this we see that we should have regard for the blood of Christ and never consider it common.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To preach Christ to others as the sin offering, we as the earthen vessels need to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are not broken and yet preach the gospel in our natural life, we will not see much result.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This signifies that the one who has been enlightened and judged by the Spirit likened to a bronze mirror to be regenerated needs not to be broken but dealt with by being scoured and rinsed.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot go in a natural way.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This verse signifies that Christ as the sin offering dealing with our sin and with our sinful nature on the cross to accomplish God's redemption for us is wholly for God's enjoyment, and we should not share it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in our ministering Christ as the sin offering to sinners, we can share Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Concerning Christ as the sin offering, there is a portion that is only for God, and there is a portion for us to share.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, God has His part, and we have our part.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These regulations concerning the sin offering are called "the law of the sin offering."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that even in the enjoyment of Christ, we must go along with all the regulations in life.</S>
