   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PROGRESSION OF DOCTRINES IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every Bible reader should know one more thing: The Bible is God's revelation handed to us in many portions and in many ways Heb 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God grants us revelation not only in many portions but in many ways, and every time He grants us a new revelation, it is more advanced than the old ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to find the advance of God's truth through the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not to say that the revelation of the Bible is incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's revelation is contained in the entire Bible and is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, this revelation is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the first stage God revealed Himself a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the second stage more of His revelation was added to the first.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the next stage more revelations were added.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is true in every successive stage, all the way until completion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot say that God's revelation is imperfect in any of the stages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, when compared to the total revelation, each revelation is incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's revelation to Abraham was perfect at his time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when we view it in the light of the total revelation today, we realize that the revelation to Abraham was not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to learn to trace God's revelation through Adam, Noah, Abraham, the children of Israel, Moses, etc., in a full and complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His revelation is always progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must also learn to distinguish God's dispensational truths from His eternal truths.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Bible some doctrines are for a certain dispensation only, while others are for all ages.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes God issued a commandment in a certain dispensation, yet this commandment was not meant to last for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, God ordered the children of Israel to kill all the Canaanites.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a dispensational truth; it is not meant to be followed for all eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to distinguish between the dispensational truths and the eternal truths.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some words are dispensational in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are directed toward men of one age, not for men of all ages.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Other words are eternal in nature; they apply to all men of all ages.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In reading the Bible we have to distinguish between the dispensational truths and the eternal truths.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to know what is applicable only to a certain age, and what is applicable to all ages.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to make a clear distinction between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, we will face many insurmountable obstacles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many people have the misconception that the words in the Old Testament are only for men of the Old Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They consider all Old Testament words to be dispensational in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Other people think that all Old Testament words are for us, and they take the entire Old Testament as eternal truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we have to separate dispensational truths from eternal truths.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If God's word to men of a certain age is applicable only to that time, it is a dispensational truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If it is equally applicable to men of all ages, it is an eternal truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eternal truths are progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In one age God may speak only one or two words.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the next age God may speak a little more.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, we have to know that the progression of truth can only develop within the bound of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Doctrines that are developed apart from the Bible cannot be considered a progression of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In reading Genesis we find that God is the Creator, the Ruler, the Law-giver, the Judge, and also the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The truth about God in the Old Testament is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These five aspects are adequately covered in the entire Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Genesis we also see that man's creation was glorious and his fall was shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He needed salvation, he sought after God, and he tried to save himself by works.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is what the book of Genesis tells us about the doctrine of man; however, the New Testament goes into a more detailed treatment of these five truths concerning man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what we mean by the progression of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From Adam to Samuel, we find theocracy, that is, God ruling over His people directly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From David and Solomon until the captivity to Babylon, we see monarchy, that is, God ruling over His people through kings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From the Babylonian captivity to the coming of the Lord Jesus, we have the rule of the prophets and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First there was theocracy, then there was monarchy, and then the rule of the prophets and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From the beginning to the end, there is a progression from outward regulations to inward regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Outwardly everything failed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But inwardly "righteousness" came.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus there is a progression of truth.</S>
