   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the ministry of the word, there is not only the manner of the delivery of the word but also the matter of willingness on the part of the deliverer.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Are we willing and happy to push out our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are willing, the word will spontaneously have a strong impact on others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we do not push out our spirit, the words will not be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Words often are common because the spirit does not break out; rather, it flows out slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A gushing spirit knocks down others along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The prayers of some brothers can only be described as a breaking forth of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Their entire spirit bursts forth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Anyone standing in their way is knocked down.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The words may be the same, but the spirit is different; it charges forth, and no one can stand in its way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether or not a person's spirit is released depends on whether he is willing and ready to pay the price.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A worker has to learn to speak accurately, but this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While he is serving, he has to learn to push out his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If he is willing to pay the price, he can push out his spirit in a strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the word goes out in this way, the spirit follows.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The release will be strong, and no one can stand in its way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If, however, a man has been wounded in some kind of way or is going through some experiences, his words may produce no effect at all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more he speaks, the worse things become and the less effect his speaking produces in others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His words may be the same, but the wound and hurt in his spirit frustrate his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Under these conditions, it is not easy for a man to see God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where there is injury, the spirit is bound, and words become hollow and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Words can only be strong when the spirit is pushed out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The spirit has to be in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The spirit has to move, and it has to be released through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can say that the spirit must be packaged in the word and released through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When one is willing to pay the price to release his spirit through the word, others will see the light and touch the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The release of the spirit is one spiritual facet in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In fulfilling the ministry of the word, one must do his best to release his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to release the spirit in a high way, one has to exert all of his energy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All of the emotions, thoughts, memory, and utterance of a person must be made available and ready.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There should be no interrupting thoughts; every thought should remain silent, focused, and available.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The memory also has to wait on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not a single feeling should run astray.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other words, all of one's energy, memory, utterance, emotions, and feelings must wait on the Lord; every part of his being must be dedicated to the Lord's use.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the activities of the self must stop; only the spirit should remain alert and ready for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is like an army with myriads of soldiers and horses on a battlefield who anxiously wait for a command from the general.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to use our mind, but our mind cannot be the master; it should only be a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to use our emotion, but our emotion cannot be the master; it should only be a servant.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All of the body's energy and strength must be headed up under the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only then will the spirit have the liberty to release itself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a minister of the word cannot find the right word at the critical moment, his spirit will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If he cannot find the right feelings at the critical moment, his spirit will also suffer; it will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No work requires a higher degree of concentration than the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order for the spirit to be released, every part of a person's being has to be focused.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This does not mean that every part of a person has to be released independently.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They should be released in conjunction with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whatever we say should be what the spirit wants to say, and whatever terminology we use should be the terminology of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Consider again our earlier illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The myriads of soldiers have to wait for the commander's word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If he wants a soldier to do something, the soldier has no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If he wants to direct another, that one has no choice either.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we order our spirit to be released, it has to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If our thoughts are a little relaxed, confused, or our memory fails a little, our spirit will be in jeopardy; it will be injured.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A minister of the word should learn not to injure his spirit in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we speak, our entire person has to be made available.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No part of our being should lag behind; we cannot afford to let any part drag along.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No part can afford to wander off and wait for its retrieval.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every part must be on full alert so that the spirit can be released to its fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This involves a high price.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because such a high price is involved, a minister of the word may not always exercise his spirit to its maximum extent even though it is possible for him to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When he is willing, his spirit will be used to a greater extent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When he is not willing, his spirit will be used to a lesser extent.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When he is willing, he can bring more blessings to others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When he is not willing, he will bring less blessings to others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The amount of blessing that others receive depends on the amount of his willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Blessing in the ministry of the word is determined by the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we are willing to give others blessing, they will receive blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we want others to be stumbled, they will be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we want a great light to shine on them, they will fall on their face.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Everything depends on the amount of growth we have in God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The more lessons we have learned from God and the higher and deeper these lessons are, the more often we will be used, and we will be used to a higher and deeper extent.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The more we learn from God, the more things we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we have learned only a little from God, we will be able to do very little.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We determine how much light others will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We determine whether or not others will fall on their face.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We determine how much spiritual reality others will touch.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord has entrusted this matter to the ministers.</S>
