   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIFE IS NOT OUR HUMAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our human life is not the life on which the Bible focuses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our human life bios and psuche is mortal Luke 8:43b; 21:4b; Matt 16:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our human life is not life because it dies and is destined to die.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The real life is immortal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whatever is mortal is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both our physical life bios and our soulish life psuche are mortal, so the human life is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Luke 8:43b and 21:4b the Greek word for "livelihood" and "living" is bios.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Bios refers to the physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Matthew 16:25-26 the Greek word for "soul-life" is psuche.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Life zoe is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eternal means immortal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First John 1:2 says, "And the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then Psalm 90:2b says, "Indeed from eternity to eternity, You are God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Strictly speaking, all lives that are mortal are not life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The real life is immortal and eternal, and this real life is God Himself because God is from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is eternal, so only God Himself is the real life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>LIFE IS GOD'S CONTENT AND GOD'S FLOWING OUT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The six foregoing points tell us what is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we need to see what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Life is God's content and God's flowing out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's content is God's being, so life is God's inner being Eph 4:18a .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's flowing out is the impartation of Himself as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Revelation 22:1 we see the river of water of life flowing out from the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is God's flowing out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Life is God's content, His inner being, and life is God flowing out into us and being imparted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>LIFE IS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to impress the saints that life is Christ John 14:6a; Col 3:4a; 1 John 5:12a .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is the embodiment of God, who is life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Colossians 2:9 says that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God as life is embodied in Christ, and Christ is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 1:18 says that no one has ever seen God, but the Only Begotten has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Hebrews 1:3 shows that Christ is the effulgence of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that Christ is the expression of God, who is life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>LIFE IS THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Finally, we need to point out that life is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Holy Spirit is the reality of Christ John 14:16-17; 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the reality of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Romans 8:2a uses the term the Spirit of life, and 2 Corinthians 3:6b says that the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, the Holy Spirit today is the Spirit of life who gives life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must stress that the Spirit in the New Testament has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, He is the Spirit of power; on the other hand, He is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to pay attention to the focus of this message: life is the Triune God dispensed into us and living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Triune God is dispensed into us in His Divine Trinity and is now living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a lesson on the definition of life is greatly needed among us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may use the term life, and yet not know what life is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to enter into a full understanding of what life is.</S>
