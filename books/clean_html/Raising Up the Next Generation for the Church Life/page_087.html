<h2 class="head1">THE SECOND ISSUE: SUICIDE</h2>
<p>The second issue of the devilish concepts indoctrinated into young people&rsquo;s minds is to commit suicide. If you study the proper statistics, you will see that the number of suicides is much larger than it was five years ago. In the earlier years of my ministry I hardly ever heard someone tell me that he wanted to end his life. But in these last few years, a number of young believers have come to me and expressed such an intention. Where did this kind of thinking originate? Undoubtedly, Satan has indoctrinated the mentality of the young people with this concept. We all must pray and stand against such subtlety of the enemy. Satan&rsquo;s whole purpose is to damage humanity so that man cannot be used for God&rsquo;s purpose. (<em>Christ as the Reality,</em> p. 126)</p>

<p>The work of Satan on man&rsquo;s body results not only in illness but also in death. Satan was a murderer from the beginning, in the same way that he was a liar from the beginning (John 8:44). We should withstand not only Satan&rsquo;s sickness but also his murdering. All thought of death is from Satan. Every notion of death as a means to escape from anything is from Satan. Satan made Job think of death. He did this not only to Job but also to every child of God. All notions of suicide, death wishes, and premature death are temptations from Satan. He tempts man to sin, and he also tempts man to die. Even thoughts of danger during one&rsquo;s travels are Satan&rsquo;s attacks. We must reject these thoughts whenever they come and not allow them to remain in us. (<em>Messages for Building Up New Believers,</em> vol. 3, p. 726)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THIRD ISSUE: MENTAL ILLNESS</h2>
<p>The third issue of the indoctrination of devilish concepts is mental illness. If you will check with today&rsquo;s younger generation, you will see that so many do not have a strong mind. Their way of thinking and their concepts are altogether unsound and unhealthy. Paul says in 2 Timothy 1:7 that God has given us a spirit of sobermindedness. We must be exceedingly healthy in our thinking, concepts, and ideas. We need to have a sound mind. (<em>Christ as the Reality,</em> p. 126)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>Problems in the heart are often the cause of mental problems. If a person&rsquo;s mind is under attack by the enemy, this is an indication that his heart is wrong in some way. Whenever the heart is wrong, it is easy for the mind to be in darkness or subject to attack. This is an important principle. Most cases of mental illness have their source in problems that exist in the heart. More than forty years ago, the superintendent of a large mental hospital told me that, according to his experience and observation, mental problems are caused by problems related to greed for money and sex. These are problems of the heart. Greed for money causes problems in the hearts of some, whereas lust causes problems in the hearts of others. Such problems cause the mind to come under attack. Through years of experience, we have learned that mental illness can be traced to problems in the heart. The mind is attacked because the heart is wrong. Perhaps someone has a certain ambition or desire in his heart. If this ambition or desire is not fulfilled and is not dealt with, the mind may be attacked. (<em>Life-study of Colossians,</em> p. 140)</p>
<h2 class="head1">TODAY&rsquo;S SITUATION</h2>
<p>We are in exactly the same kind of situation today as was the early church. At that time the church was degraded and society was ruined, and it is clear that it is the same today. Therefore, we must all realize that we are in a situation that requires the Lord&rsquo;s humanity for His recovery. There must be a group of people to stand against the tide of this age. But what is the way for us to stand? Is it by divine power? (<em>Christ as the Reality,</em> p. 145)</p>
<h2 class="head1">HUMAN VIRTUES FOR A DEGRADED AGE</h2>
<p>When Paul wrote [1 and 2 Timothy and Titus], the church was degraded, and under that kind of degradation, the need was not mainly for teachings or gifts, but human virtues. I believe that the message of these three books just fits today&rsquo;s situation. We are under such a degradation. What is the proper cure for this age? What is the proper dose for this generation? The answer is the proper humanity that comes from the man Jesus. The proper humanity is the only healing power for today&rsquo;s generation. I have confidence that the Lord will use the church as a remedy for today&rsquo;s crooked and perverse generation. The remedy for such a generation is a church with the proper humanity. I have the full assurance that if the young people in the church take the humanity of Jesus, they will be the proper remedy for this generation.</p>
<p>I do believe that today in the church life the Lord is going to recover His humanity. We not only need His power; we need His humanity. We not only need what He can do; we need what He is. I cannot believe that the miraculous gifts are the remedy for today&rsquo;s generation. Rather, the proper humanity shining forth through the young brothers and sisters will be a strong testimony and remedy to this present age. And this humanity will also cause us to have the strongest church life. The fruit of the Spirit is just the expression of the humanity of Jesus. (<em>Christ as the Reality,</em> pp. 140-141, 142)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>It is abundantly clear from [1 and 2 Timothy and Titus] that we need a strong, adequate, and proper humanity in order to have the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in such a degraded time. We do not need divine power as much as we need the humanity of Jesus to stand up in such a degraded age. This is the standing power of the acacia wood. If we follow the course of today&rsquo;s age, we are like the jellyfish, without any backbone. Whatever way the tide goes, the jellyfish follow. We do need a strong backbone to stand against the current of today&rsquo;s age for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and this backbone can issue only from the humanity of Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER WAY</h2>
<p>Then what is the way to enjoy such a humanity? In [2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2:21-22; 1:7; and 4:22] we are able to see five main items. By these we can see the apostle Paul&rsquo;s concept concerning the way to take the humanity of Jesus. The first was to call on the name of the Lord from a pure heart. &ldquo;Flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&rdquo; (2:22). When we call on the name of the Lord, we are really taking His humanity into us. Then Paul referred to the Scriptures: &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed...&rdquo; (3:16). All Scripture is breathed out by God to make us genuine and proper men of God. We not only need to call on the Lord, but we must also breathe in every word of the Scriptures. This is simply to pray-read the Word. How important are these two items for taking the Lord&rsquo;s humanity! We must call on the Lord, and we must breathe in His Word.</p>
<p>The third item is the Body life. Paul did not say simply to call on the Lord by yourself but with &ldquo;those&rdquo; (2:22). This is a corporate life. We enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s humanity by being with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Fourth, Paul tells us that we have a spirit to exercise. &ldquo;For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness&rdquo; (1:7). And fifth, we have a wonderful person in our spirit: &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit&rdquo; (4:22).</p>
<p>We have these five matters to practice: calling on the Lord, breathing in the Scriptures, having the Body life, exercising our spirit, and realizing the Lord Jesus within our spirit. This reveals the concept of the apostle Paul. How can we enjoy the humanity of Jesus? Simply by these five things. We have to call on the Lord, we must breathe in the Word, and we must do these things in a Body way in the church life. For this we have such a strengthening factor in our spirit. The Lord Jesus, who is the real humanity, is in our spirit. By exercising our spirit to call on Him and to breathe in the Word in a corporate way, we simply enjoy His humanity.</p>
<p>We must pray for the entire situation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, that all the brothers and sisters in the local churches may have a full enjoyment of the humanity of Jesus. Then we will be the acacia boards, standing steadfastly against the current of this evil age. This will be our strong testimony, and this will bring the recovery of the local church life to all the leading cities. (<em>Christ as the Reality,</em> pp. 146, 149-150, 151)</p>
