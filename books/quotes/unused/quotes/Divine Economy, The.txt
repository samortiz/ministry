In Ephesians the Apostle Paul wants to show us that the church as the Body of Christ is something of God's economy
The Bible unveils to us the age before the law, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom
The fourth age will be the age of the kingdom, the age of the millennium, the thousand years of Christ's reign
In the age before the law, God dealt with the patriarchs mainly according to His mercy and grace based upon His promise
The Lord Jesus declared that He was the bread of life , and Paul said that he was charged to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ
He was to be a steward in the same way that Joseph was a great steward to distribute the rich life supply of Pharaoh's household
Every time we are gathered into the name of the Lord Jesus , we enjoy the dispensing of the riches of Christ into our being
In the church life the Lord has redeemed us from different peoples and from different races, yet we all are one
Ephesians 3:9 talks about the dispensation , the economy of the mystery, 'which from the ages has been hidden in God'
God's hidden purpose is His economy, His administrative plan, to distribute Himself into all His chosen people
He then made a plan to administrate His purpose, and this plan is to dispense Himself into all His chosen people
In the Lord's ministry we only care for the divine dispensing of the Triune God Himself into His chosen people
What multifarious wisdom it took on God's part to prepare everything so that He could dispense Himself into us
We all need to praise and thank the Lord for the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity into sinners to make them the sons of God
It was hidden in God in eternity past and continued to be hidden in God for the first four thousand years of human history
Paul was the one who began to see something hidden in God, something in God's heart that had never been revealed to the sons of men
Paul received a revelation of this mystery and in his fourteen Epistles Gods economy is stressed emphasized and developed to the uttermost
In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul tells us that the New Testament ministers and teachers should only teach one thing God's economy
Christianity has been divided mainly by different teachings, yet in the Bible there is only one main teaching the teaching of God's economy
Now we need to ask why God created man in His own image, making man a copy of Himself, and why God created man with a spirit
God created man in His own image, after His own likeness, with a spirit to worship Him and contact Him because of His divine economy
We can exercise our spirit, our inner receiver, to receive the heavenly divine transmission of the wonderful Triune God
We have God Himself in our spirit, and we can be filled with God and full of God to express Him and represent Him as a God-man
If we eat of Christ as the tree of life, we are receiving Him into our being to be our life supply, and we are no longer empty
When we see the divine economy, we will realize that God created man in His image so that He can dispense Himself into man
In addition to the tree of life, the picture in Genesis 2 shows us that there is also a river which went out of Eden to water the garden
John 7 tells us that whoever believes in Jesus and receives His life will have rivers of living water flowing out of his innermost being
In John 6 is the bread of life with the riches of life, and in John 7 are the rivers flowing with living water
These two chapters show us that when we receive the divine life, this life flows in our being as a river of living water
When the resin of the tree, the tree's life secretion, the tree's sap, congeals into gum, this gum is considered as a transparent pearl
In Genesis 2 there is gold, bdellium, and onyx stone, and in 1 Corinthians 3 Paul refers to gold, silver, and precious stones
At the end of the Bible in the book of Revelation, the holy city, New Jerusalem, is built with three items gold, pearls, and precious stones
In Genesis, 1 Corinthians, and Revelation, in all these three portions of the divine revelation, are three materials
The Jews and the Moslems believe in the God of creation, but we believe in the God not only of creation, but also in resurrection
The Triune God in resurrection became a man, lived on this earth as a man, passed through death, and was resurrected
The God in creation created the universe, but the God in resurrection regenerates us and transforms us to make us a new creation
As the God in creation He created us, but as the God in resurrection, He regenerates and transforms us to make us a new creation
We have already pointed out that bdellium is a pearl produced from the plant life and not from the animal life
The shedding of the blood from the animal life is required for redemption, but with the plant life there is no thought of redemption
Bdellium signifies that the Son of God had to be a tree to be broken to secrete His life-juice to produce bdellium
When the oyster is wounded by a particle of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the sand and makes it a precious pearl
We have to believe that the Lord has added some amount of gold, bdellium or silver, and onyx stone into our being
We need to worship the Lord that He is the tree of life and the life-giving Spirit as the river of water of life flowing within us
The tree is the embodiment of the divine life just as your physical body is the embodiment of your physical life
The Word in the beginning was God Himself, and this very God became flesh, a man in the flesh by the name of Jesus
When we believed in Him, we not only got saved, but we also received the divine life because He is the embodiment of this life
The bread of life is the life supply in the form of food, like the tree of life , which is also the life supply 'good for food'
For Jesus to tell us that He is the bread of life implies that He is eatable, and He told us directly that we can eat Him
In John 15 the Lord Jesus told us directly that He was the vine, and in Revelation 22 the tree of life is a vine
God has prepared the tree of life for our eternal enjoyment, but today we have to enjoy the tree of life as a foretaste
If we do not have the foretaste today, we could never have the full taste in the next age, the age of the kingdom
To eat of the tree of life, that is, to enjoy Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life
Praise Him for the tree of life, the embodiment of God as life, to be eaten and enjoyed by us to make us men of life!
The man Jesus was the embodiment of God as life, so John says that in Him, in Jesus, in the embodiment of God, was life
We have become the branches of Christ because we have received Him, we have eaten Him, and we are still eating
The tree of life is the embodiment of life, but in order for this life to enter into us there is the need for it to flow
In 1 Corinthians 10 Paul told us that the rock was Christ who followed the children of Israel in the wilderness
The water flowing out of the rock was the flowing of the divine life, just like the milk is the flowing of the cow life
In the garden there was the tree of life as the embodiment of the divine life but this life has to flow out and into us for Gods dispensing
When we drink of this Spirit, we enjoy the river, and rivers of living water will flow out of our innermost being
In the same way, the river of our God is full of the water of life to satisfy us, quench our thirst, and make us glad
When this river comes to a certain country, it makes that country living; it makes city after city in that country living
The Lord Jesus told us that whoever drinks of Him will have rivers of living water flowing out of his innermost being
We are drinking of the river that flows out of the spring, and this spring is the very embodiment of the fountain
God the Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is flowing by the Spirit, and the Spirit reaches us as the living water for our enjoyment
Our God today is the embodied God, the manifested God, the touchable God, and this touchable God is a man by the name of Jesus
John wrote his Gospel in a simple way, but all the points conveyed in it are marvelous, profound, and mysterious
We may have been told in the past that when the Son came to be born as a man, He left the Father on the throne in heaven
In the day that Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper and Mary poured the precious ointment on Him , He was the Son with the Father
If He were merely the Son and left the Father in the heavens when He came, He would not be the embodiment of God
In verse 29 of the same chapter the Lord Jesus said, 'And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone'
Are three verses telling us that the Lord Jesus was never alone while He was on this earth because the Father was always with Him
The Son is the very embodiment of the Triune God as the tree of life for the Triune God to dispense Himself into all His children
In this embodiment is the Son and the Father, even the Triune God, because God wanted to dispense Himself into His chosen people
If He were on the earth, and the Father were far away in the heavens, it would have been impossible for Him to live because of the Father
Since He came with the Father and was one with the Father, He could live because of the Father and by the Father
John 14:24 says, 'He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me'
In the Lord's recovery we do not want to follow any traditional teaching, but we want to come back to the pure Word
The Son became incarnated and lived a human life in order that God could dispense Himself into His chosen people
God became a man that He might dispense Himself into man, and this God is triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
The conception of Jesus was not by a human father with a human mother but by the Holy Spirit with a human virgin
Up to the time that Jesus was born, there had never been such a person of two essences, elements, and natures to be both God and man
The Lord Jesus came out at the age of thirty to minister, to serve God, to preach the gospel, to carry out God's economy
We saw that Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit and that this Holy Spirit as the divine element was the constituent of Jesus
The Holy Spirit He received at His conception was for His being, His existence, and became an element of His person
For His work, for His ministry, He needed more of the Holy Spirit; He needed the divine power of the Holy Spirit, the divine equipment
Economically, the Holy Spirit as the power came upon Him, not for Him to exist but to empower Him to work for God
We all need to learn these two aspects of the Spirit for Jesus' person and work the essential aspect and the economical aspect
The baptism in the Holy Spirit is uniquely one and was accomplished upon the Body of Christ more than nineteen hundred years ago
The experiences of the baptism in the Holy Spirit are numerous and continually shared by all the members of the Body
When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we do not enjoy the Son only, without the Father and without the Spirit
We have seen that Christ's incarnation, human living, conception, and ministry are all related to God's economy
God's intention is to dispense Himself into man, but man was occupied, surrounded, and even utilized by negative things
In this universe and on this earth, within and among men, is something personified, something living, and something powerful and very evil
As the people made by God for His own purpose, we were all occupied, surrounded, and taken over by these eight things
That would have meant that when Jesus died on the cross, He was purely and merely a man with no divine essence, no divine element
You can take a person's belongings, but you cannot take away his human nature since this is an intrinsic part of his being
God told Moses to lift up a brass serpent on their behalf for God's judgment, that by looking upon that brass serpent all may live
John says that God became flesh , but Romans 8:3 tells us that Jesus was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin
The Son of God did indeed become flesh; however, He was only in the likeness of the flesh and had no participation in the sin of the flesh
As the last Adam, as a man in the old creation, He died on the cross for us in the old creation, crucifying our old man on the cross
Ephesians 2:14-16 tells us that Christ died on the cross as the Peacemaker to abolish all the separations among the human race
In the church life there are people from all colors, races, and countries that are enjoying the divine oneness
All the foregoing six items of Christ's death are involved with clearing up the negative things in the universe
His death on the cross as a grain of wheat released the divine life from within Him to impart, to dispense, this life into all His believers
He died as the grain of life to release the divine life from within Him to dispense God into all of us as the divine life
We have seen that when Jesus was conceived and born of the Holy Spirit, He was constituted essentially with the divine essence
Economically when He was thirty years old, after His baptism, the Father spoke from the heavens and the Spirit came to descend upon Him
It was in these three hours that God condemned sin in the flesh, destroyed the serpent, and judged the power of death
After His baptism, while He was standing in the water, the Spirit as a dove descended upon Him not essentially but economically
In the same way God forsook Him economically in the last three hours on the cross while God was judging Him as sin and as the brass serpent
Blood is to wash away our sins for redemption, and water is to dispense the divine life into us for life impartation
The blood was typified by the blood of the passover Lamb , and the water by the water that flowed out of the smitten rock
Four main items concerning Christ in His divine economy are His incarnation, His human living, His death, and His resurrection
If we understand these four major items of Christ, we will realize that these major points of Christ's process are for the divine economy
People generally do not have the concept of resurrection, but in God's creation we can see the principle of resurrection
We may consider the matter of a grain of wheat falling into the earth and dying in a common way, but the principle here is not common
Life was only in Christ as the one grain, but after dying and resurrecting, His life was dispensed into many grains
By His rising up, the life within Him was dispensed into all of the disciples to make each one of them a grain
In God's eyes we all were fallen in Adam six thousand years ago, and in God's eyes we all were resurrected in Christ two thousand years ago
When we were resurrected with Christ, the divine life was dispensed into us, so we were regenerated in Christ's resurrection
When we live by our natural life in a natural way, we are no longer the church because the church is absolutely a matter in resurrection
The rib out of Adam's side signifies the unbreakable eternal life, and the water out of the Lord's side also signifies the eternal life
Since the church is altogether a matter in resurrection, we must abandon all our natural ways to do things, and abandon our natural life
Through the surpassing resurrection of Christ the life of God in Christ has been dispensed into all His believers thus producing the church
Praise the Lord for the resurrection of Christ, through which we were regenerated and the church was produced!
He was not a common man but a God-man, who lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years and passed through human living
Many Bible teachers have told people that the Word became flesh, but not many have taught that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
One day about two thousand years ago He took a wonderful step God was born out of a virgin in a manger to become a man
It is marvelous that the Creator of the universe of the heavens and of the earth lived in a poor carpenters home not as a guest but as a son
On the negative side, Jesus as the God-man cleared up the entire universe to accomplish an all-inclusive redemption
In 1 Corinthians 15 Paul tells us that a seed has a form when it is sown into the earth, but when it dies and grows it is in another form
The disciples, who were under the threatening of death, had the door shut in the place in which they had gathered
After resurrection, the Lord Jesus still possessed a body, a spiritual body, yet that spiritual body was still touchable
He is in the heavens, and at the same time, as the omnipresent Spirit, He is in our spirit to give us life and also peace
In John 7:38 the Lord Jesus said that whoever would believe in Him would have rivers of living water flowing out of his innermost being
In John 14:10-11 the Lord revealed that He was one with the Father the Father was in Him and He was in the Father
The very 'He' who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the very 'I' who is the Lord Himself in verse 18
Because He is the Son in the name of the Father, He is qualified to tell the disciples that He will not leave them orphans
In the day of resurrection, the disciples would know that the Lord was in His Father, that they were in Him, and that He was in them
Now the Spirit was sent in the Son's name, indicating that in name He was the Son and that in person He was the Spirit
We have seen from the Holy Bible that the Son is in the name of the Father and that the Spirit is in the name of the Son
The Spirit of God is God Himself, the Spirit of Jehovah is Jehovah Himself, and the Spirit of Jesus is Jesus Himself
Now it is the Spirit as the Son with the Father compounded with divinity, humanity, human living, death, and resurrection
God is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit for God's dispensing, so that God can dispense Himself into man
When the Son came, He came with the Father and by the Spirit, so He was the embodiment of the Triune God while He was on this earth
In between what is revealed is that the Son came with the Father by the Spirit and died and resurrected to be realized as the Spirit
The Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaches us to be our life to be our life supply and to be our everything
The Spirit breathed into the disciples at the end of John is the totality of the Triune God, the aggregate of the processed Triune God
If you have the Spirit you have the Son with all the processes He has gone through and all His accomplishments obtainments and attainments
You have the Son's person, the Son's work, the Son's humanity, the Son's human living, the Son's death, and the Son's resurrection
Because the Spirit comes with the Father, what the Father is, has, can do, is doing, and will do are all here with the Spirit
Corinthians 3:6 tells us that the Spirit gives life, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 tells us that the Lord is the Spirit
Henry Alford, who was an authority on Greek New Testament words, also indicated that the Lord is identical with the Holy Spirit
Andrew Murray, in his book The Spirit of Christ, tells us that the Spirit is the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the Spirit of the God-man
When this Spirit dwells in you, God the Father, God the Son, God the Spirit, and the uplifted, resurrected, and ascended Man dwells in you
The incarnation, human living, the effectiveness of the all-inclusive death of Christ, and the power of His resurrection are in you
The life-giving Spirit gives life to your spirit, soul, and body, to make your entire being life, making you a man of life
The Lord is not interested in outward correction and adjustment but in our transformation, our being changed metabolically
In some Christian weddings the pastor charges the man to love his wife and charges the woman to submit herself to her new husband
Although the husband and wife agree to do this, shortly after the wedding both of them may realize that they cannot do this
The wife realizes that she cannot submit herself to her husband, and the husband realizes that he cannot love his wife to the uttermost
To teach the husband to love his wife and the wife to submit herself to her husband is the ethical teaching of religion
Ethical teachings are according to man's culture, not according to God's economy, not according to God's Spirit
You need to turn your heart to the Lord so that there is nothing between you and the Lord, nothing between you and the Spirit
As seven is the number for completion in God's operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God's move on the earth
In substance and existence God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation God's Spirit is sevenfold
In essence the Spirit is one, but in function especially at the end times in the dark age, God's Spirit is sevenfold
The all-inclusive, compound, processed, life-giving Spirit today in the Lord's recovery is seven times intensified
The sevenfold Spirit is now strengthening us, saturating us, enlightening us, shining upon us, and shining from within us
In the Old Testament are the Spirit of God for God's creation and the Spirit of Jehovah for God's contact with man
Revelation 5:6 tells us that the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb, and this means that the Spirit is the eyes of the Lord Jesus
The Lord Jesus revealed this matter of coinherence when He said that He was in the Father and that the Father was in Him
In the last chapter we saw that the Spirit is the all-inclusive, compound, processed, life-giving, sevenfold intensified Spirit
Some teach that the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, is only a power, a means, or an instrument for God to do something
That one seed of Abraham is Christ , the Son of God, and the blessing promised Abraham is this all-inclusive, compound Spirit
The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ
The Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God's bountiful supply for us to enjoy
When we open up ourselves to this total and aggregate Spirit, we enjoy the all-inclusive blessing of the New Testament
When we enjoy the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit, this supply strengthens, enables, and sustains us to live Christ
Timothy 422 says The Lord be with your spirit and Galatians 618 says The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit brothers
If you have a strong mind full of doctrines and do not enjoy the Lord in your spirit, you will end up in division
A feast may be set in front of you on a table, but you may come just to exercise your mind to learn about all the different dishes
When you touch the Spirit, you touch the all-inclusive Spirit, you touch the rich grace, and you enjoy the Lord
As you behold and reflect Him, you will be transformed metabolically to become more and more like Him in His glorious image
As you are living Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit who indwells your spirit will dispense life into you all the time
In the twentytwo books from Acts through Jude is the Spirit as the Son with the Father the allinclusive compound processed lifegiving Spirit
Revelation 21:6 indicates that our Triune God will give us to drink of the spring of the water of life for eternity
Do not forget that the Spirit is sent as the Son with the Father, so the water of life flows as the spring with the fountain
The Spirit of life comes to us and reaches and enters into us as the divine essence to constitute us into something divine
In the Gospel of John there is the Spirit of life , and in Paul's Epistles there are many references to the Spirit of life
In Romans 8:2 Paul used the term 'the Spirit of life,' and in 2 Corinthians 3:6 he says, 'the Spirit gives life'
On the day of Pentecost, fifty days after the day of resurrection, there was the fulfillment of another promise, the promise in Joel 2:28-32
The fulfillment in Acts 2 on the day of Pentecost was the fulfillment of God the Father's promise in the Old Testament
In Joel 2 the promise of God the Father was concerning the Spirit as power to enable people to prophesy, to see visions, and to dream dreams
By this Spirit we have been regenerated to be the children of God, and by this Spirit of life we are the sons of God
Without the Spirit of life, we could not be children of God; we could have never been regenerated and could never be spiritually constituted
After fifty days, the Holy Spirit descended upon them economically, just as the Holy Spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus after His baptism
In John 20 on the day of resurrection the Lord came and breathed upon them and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
He knew how to interpret the Scriptures, and he took the lead with the one hundred twenty to pray in one accord for ten days
They kept the Lord's word to tarry in Jerusalem, and they prayed together in one accord, not just for one prayer meeting, but for ten days
You may be drinking water in your kitchen, but when you come out to meet me, you cannot come without the proper clothing
To drink water is essential for you to exist, but to put on the proper clothing is economical for you to meet someone
On the day of resurrection the disciples began to drink the 'water,' yet they did not have the power from on high to clothe them
Now, according to God's economy, God had to put all His sons together to baptize them in the Spirit of God into one Body
The Jewish believers as well as the Gentile believers in the past, present, or future were all baptized once for all into one Body
Only two events are referred to as the baptism in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2 and in Cornelius' house in Acts 10
In Acts 1:5 the Lord Jesus said, 'For John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now'
In Acts 11:15-17 Peter reported that this was exactly what happened on the day of Pentecost to the Jewish believers
Only these two events, one on the day of Pentecost and the other in the house of Cornelius, were the baptism in the Holy Spirit
If two hundred new believers will be saved tomorrow, the Lord Jesus will not need to come to die for them again
If some come to ask you if you have received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, you must surely reply that you have
The Bible tells us that Jesus died for us, but the Bible tells us further that Christ baptized us into one Body
Peter and the other disciples were baptized on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter two, but before that time they were still saved
The stronger school, however, said that without this baptism with the speaking in tongues you could not be regenerated
Hudson Taylor, the founder of China Inland Mission, also did not speak in tongues, yet you cannot say that he was not regenerated
Many great speakers of the Keswick conventions never spoke in tongues, yet we could not say that they were not regenerated
The Greek word for tongue in Acts 2:4 is glossa, whereas the Greek word for dialect, dialektos, is used in verses 6 and 8
On the third day the brother may speak in tongues again in the same way, and another will interpret in yet a third different way
A linguist could tell you that this simple utterance of four syllables was the same on each of the three nights
In this matter we should come back to the pure Word because there is such an influence today that disturbs God's seeking people
The Will also tells us that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is accomplished upon the Body of Christ and waiting to be taken
We are so thankful that You speak out of the tent of meeting, and we believe that You will speak to us further
Open up Your mind to us, show us Your economy, and bring us all into the reality of Your word to impress us with Yourself
Breathing and drinking are the most crucial things to our physical life, and it is exactly the same with our spiritual life
Corinthians 12:7-10 is concerning the manifestation of the Spirit, which is the issue of the essential and economical aspects of the Spirit
Thank the Lord for the regeneration of the Spirit of life, the baptism of the Spirit of power, and the manifestation of the Spirit
The manifestation of the Spirit requires both aspects of the Spirit the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power
Older people generally have more wisdom because wisdom comes from the stature of life, from the maturity of life
In every meeting the first manifestation of the Spirit we have is the word of wisdom and then the word of knowledge
When he spoke some nonsensical Indonesian, the leader of the group and his wife rejoiced that he 'spoke in tongues'
The head is the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge, the top two items of the manifestation of the Spirit
The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues, do not require any growth in life
Corinthians 14:4 says, 'He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church'
Now we are in the church enjoying the Spirit, drinking of the Spirit, contacting the all-inclusive Spirit, and being transformed
Corinthians 12 and 14 deal with the manifestation of the Spirit, but 1 Corinthians was not written for this purpose
Because we are so natural, we have our own desire, our own intention, our own likes and dislikes, and our own way
We must open our entire being to Him by calling upon His name in a real way , in a way to touch the Spirit in our spirit
He will expose us to the uttermost in all our failures, wrongdoings, mistakes, natural intentions, and lustful and selfish desires
You are still full of the self, living in the natural life, and doing things in a natural way always by yourself
Every day you need to confess your failure that you do not live Christ, that you do not walk according to spirit
Day after day you will learn to practice to walk according to spirit, to practice being one spirit with the Lord
As we practice the one spirit with the Lord, we will grow and be transformed for the building up of the Body of Christ
Wherever we would go and wherever we might be, we would be one with the churches, which means that we are built up
In the Lord's recovery, the Lord is not concerned with the many works related to the miraculous manifestation of the Spirit
The Lord wants one thing that we all grow in life and be transformed in life for the building up of the Body of Christ
We should take no other way but this one way to live Christ, to walk according to spirit, to practice the one spirit with the Lord
When we live in such a oneness, God has an opportunity to dispense Himself more and more into us and more and more into other people
In the book of Revelation the all-inclusive, compound, processed, life-giving Spirit is now intensified seven times
Finally, in Revelation is the life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, seven times intensified
In substance and existence God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation, God's Spirit is sevenfold
Economically speaking, the Spirit of God in God's administration is the eyes of the administrating Son, the seven Spirits
Christ is the very focal Executor of God's economy, yet He needs the seven Spirits as His eyes to carry out God's economy
By the Lord's mercy, we have seen that in the book of Revelation there is the sevenfold Spirit for the testimony of Jesus
Since the seven lamps are the seven Spirits, the essence and the shape of the lampstand must also be something of the Triune God
The golden essence signifies God the Father, and the shape, the form, the appearance, of the lampstand signifies God the Son
In the lampstand we see the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, so the golden lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God
God the Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is expressed through the Spirit this is the testimony of Jesus
Every local church is a golden lampstand, and the golden lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God as the testimony of Jesus
Eventually, the churches in actuality will be according to the reality of the vision of the churches as the golden lampstands
In Revelation 1, John saw the vision of the seven golden lampstands representing or signifying the seven local churches
He is 'clothed with a garment reaching to the feet' which is the priestly robe , and He is walking in the midst of the lampstands
The Lord Jesus appears in Revelation as the High Priest walking among the lampstands to snuff the burned out wicks and to add more oil
In Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord was there as the High Priest snuffing the wicks and adding more oil to the lampstands
He is snuffing the wicks of the lampstands and adding more oil to make all the golden lampstands pure and shining
Quite often, a local church will also be short of oil, short of the Spirit, so the Lord has to come in to fill the local church with the oil
It is by this way that a local church is built up bit by bit and more and more until it becomes a golden lampstand in reality
We may realize that the church in our locality is not yet according to the vision in Revelation 1 of a golden lampstand
When we say 'not yet' this indicates that there is hope that the time will come when all the churches will be golden in reality
In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the churches are different in the negative sense
The specific, particular characteristics of the apostate church in Thyatira were Jezebel, idol worship, fornication, and adultery
The characteristic of the church in Sardis was deadness , and the characteristic of the church in Laodicea was lukewarmness
All the local churches, not only in the cities of one nation but also in all the cities of all the nations, should be exactly the same
Suppose that you visited all the local churches throughout the earth and you realized that they were exactly the same
The British do not like to be the same as the French, and the French do not want to be the same as the Americans
A local church in England may be a church full of patience, whereas a local church in America will be a quick church with no patience
We all have to learn how to follow the other churches, how to be one with the churches, and how to be the same as the churches
The church in So Paulo helps the church in Los Angeles, and the church in Los Angeles receives help from the church in Stuttgart
If we all receive the divine help from one another, we will be shaped into the same kind of image, the same appearance
All the local churches should only bear one characteristic the characteristic of the Son with the Father by the Spirit
All the golden lampstands bear the same appearance and testify the same person the all-inclusive person of Christ
In the last book of the Bible, which is the conclusion of the entire New Testament and even of the entire Bible, there are two great signs
At the beginning of Revelation is the sign of the golden lampstands, and at the end is the greatest sign, the sign of the New Jerusalem
Our flesh, our self, our natural man, and everything about us related to the old creation, even our good self, must be reduced
The black, charred part of the wicks of the lampstand signifies our flesh, our natural man, our self, and our old creation
A brother may exercise so much of his self, his old creation, and his natural life, that these natural things become black
The great multitude consists of the redeemed ones, throughout all generations from the nations, who constitute the church
In 14:1-5 is the firstfruit of the believers before the great tribulation, the one hundred and forty-four thousand
Christ died to clear up the old creation, so eventually the old creation with the old heaven and the old earth will pass away

He dwells in us and we dwell in Him, and this mutual dwelling is the New Jerusalem, which to God is the tabernacle and to us is the temple
Today in this age there is marriage, but in the resurrection there will be no marriage because all will be like the angels
Today God is our dwelling place, our food, our drink, our life, our light, our nature, and our element to become our expression
