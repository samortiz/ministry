<P>In the previous message we saw the first three items of the constituents of the vital groups: the believers in Christ, the disciples of Christ, and the witnesses of Christ. In message one we pointed out that to live the church life, we have to pursue with those who call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart (2 Tim. 2:22). Also, we have to learn how to enjoy Christ as the Spirit in our spirit to be the abiding grace for our enjoyment (4:22). We have to ask ourselves if we practice this day by day. In our daily living, do we enjoy Christ as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit to be the abiding grace for our enjoyment? We may pray for this, but do we practice our prayer? We have to admit that we have not allowed the Lord to fully disciple us in this aspect.</P><P>The apostle Peter was born a typical Jew. His concept was altogether Jewish, and he was a fisherman. But one day the divine and mystical One, Jesus, came to him. The Lord Jesus was so captivating in a mysterious way. When He told Peter to come after Him, he immediately left his work and followed Him (Matt. 4:18-20). Jesus spent time with Peter day and night for three and a half years in order to disciple him to be as He was, a God-man. Jesus was a man, even a Jew, but He lived something divine. Peter's concept was changed to fish for men, to gain men for God's economy.</P><P>We may be able to say that we need to live the divine life by denying our natural life. We may be eloquent speakers, but do we live such a life? I am thankful to the Lord that He will not let us go. He disciples the sinners and tax collectors to make them God-men who live Christ. He is discipling us so that we can be the genuine constituents of the vital groups. In this message we want to see the last three items of these constituents: the members of Christ, the brothers of Christ, and the prophets of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST</H2><P>After we have been discipled to be Christ's witnesses, we are qualified to be His members. Romans 12:5 says, "So we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another." As Christ's members, we are a part of Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Organic Salvation of God Being with Christ as the Center and His Body as the Spreading</H2><P>The organic salvation of God is with Christ, the Head, as the center, and His Body as the spreading.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Constituting His Body</H2><P>The members of Christ constitute His Body for His spreading by His multiplication. We in the Lord's recovery are spreading Christ for His multiplication, but our rate of multiplication has not been that high. Christ is great, so He needs a great Body with many members through His multiplication. We should remember these two words: spreading and multiplication.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ's Multiplication</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. A Grain of Wheat</H2><P>Christ's multiplication is by Him as a grain of wheat producing many grains (John 12:24). He is the unique original grain, and we are the many grains. In our function we should be the same as Christ for His multiplication.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Vine Tree</H2><P>In John 15 the Lord said, "I am the vine; you are the branches" (v. 5). The branches are not for blossoming but for bearing fruit. Christ as the vine tree bears much fruit as His multiplication through His branches, His members.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Spreading God through Speaking</H2><P>The multiplication of Christ spreads God through speaking for the increase of Christ, His bride. John the Baptist said, "He who has the bride is the bridegroom....He must increase, but I must decrease" (John 3:29-30). This increase is the bride.</P>
