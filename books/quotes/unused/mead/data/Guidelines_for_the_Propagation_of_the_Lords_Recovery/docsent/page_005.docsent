   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOING OUT TO DISTRIBUTE FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a spiritual famine throughout the earth just as there was a famine in Joseph s time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, the Lord s recovery is a storehouse filled with food, just as Joseph s storehouses were.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen the need among God s children; therefore, we should rise up and distribute the food in our storehouse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not go out to distribute food, our food will breed worms and stink.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I visited Taiwan in the past, I was not satisfied with our meetings, but this time I have a different feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am satisfied and even surprised, because many saints have become scholarly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Their testimonies and prayers show that they have learned many things, and their use of expressions such as essence and economy shows that their utterance has improved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, we still need to lift up our eyes to see that many households are starving and that there is famine everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to send food to the starving households.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since we have so much food in our household, we should have the heart to distribute this food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The general subject of this training is Guidelines for the Propagation of the Lord s Recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The burden and goal of this training is to propagate the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not merely sit in Joseph s storehouses and enjoy the food.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to distribute and propagate these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>PROPAGATING THE LORD S RECOVERY Pursuing the Truth to Be Equipped</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the propagation of the Lord s recovery, we must pursue the truth in order to be equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Timothy 3:17 says, That the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible is our equipment, and we need to be fully equipped in God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible is our armor and our weapon in our warfare against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not have pastors or preachers among us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everyone here is an evangelist and a preacher of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need to be teachers of the Word, and we also need to be apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Speaking to People to Minister the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some saints may say that Brother Lee can be an apostle but that they cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not think that we cannot be apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we speak the truth to our parents, we are apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can say, The Lord Jesus sent me to share good news with you: you need Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is life and light, and He is our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you receive Him, you will receive life and be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we say this, we are apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can be apostles to our parents even though we are their children.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We also have many friends and relatives with whom we can share the good news through preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible reveals that apostles are all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their functions include preaching the gospel, prophesying, and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are apostles; we preach the gospel, and teach the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Paul said, I was appointed a herald and an apostle...a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth 1 Tim 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul was sent to be an apostle to teach people the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must also go out to meet people s need.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to be equipped when we teach the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose we have a relative who has been a Christian for many years, but he does not know the meaning of justification, sanctification, essence, economy, and the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should be able to speak clearly on sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are unable to, we are a false teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be a teacher, we need to know how to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should be able to say, In John 17:17 the Lord Jesus said, Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our speaking does not need to be longer than fifteen minutes, but it should be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This will surprise our relative, and he will realize that even though he has attended Sunday services for years, he never heard his pastor say that John 17:17 is on sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps he will open his Bible and consider what we have said.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then he will be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Redeeming the Time</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>and Seizing the Opportunity</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei practice speaking the truth to people every day, there will be a result.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the past, sixty percent of our service to the Lord was in vain, and only forty percent was effective.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We often had vain conversations with people and wasted their time by speaking about outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to seize the opportunity to speak with our relatives a short word about sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we ride a bus, we should have some gospel tracts and a small Bible with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are equipped, we can speak to people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may begin a gospel conversation with someone by saying, You are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is a verse in the Bible that speaks about being blessed, and it says, Blessed are the pure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whether or not he receives our gospel, we have sown the seed of the gospel into him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During a bus ride of ten or twenty minutes, we can do the work of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we will do this, the city of Taipei will be permeated with the gospel in one year, and many will be saved and brought to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some may say that they are very busy, because they go to school, work, and do other things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In addition, they have a busy church life with meetings and services every day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, they do not have time for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should never be busy in a blind way and not have any result.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should consider how much time we waste in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to redeem the time and labor in the gospel in our neighborhood, at school, and at work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may need to be like a nurse who speaks with people when she is giving them a vaccination.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We do not need to hold a Bible in our hand in order to speak the truth, and we do not need to look as if we are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We simply need to be spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need to spread the good news and be a gospel messenger.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We also need to study the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The outline of this message presents the following main points: the apostle Paul was a teacher of the truth 1 Tim 2:7 , the church is the pillar and base of the truth 3:15 , God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth 2:4; 4:3; 2 Tim 2:25; 3:7; Titus 1:1 , the word of the truth is the gospel of our salvation Eph 1:13 , knowing the truth sets us free John 8:32 , God s word is the truth that sanctifies us 17:17 , we must build up ourselves upon our most holy faith Jude 20 , we must be fully equipped with the Scripture 2 Tim 3:16-17 , we must cut straight the word of the truth 2:15 , and the word of God grows Acts 6:7; 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>These items require our careful study.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we meet a pastor in Christianity, we should fellowship with him and speak the truth to him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even if we speak with an archbishop in the Catholic Church, we can say to him, Everyone needs to be regenerated, and you also need to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We can speak the truth concerning regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to be trained and to practice so that we are not intimidated when we see a pastor or an archbishop.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all need to speak the truth, cut straight the word of the truth, and open the Bible to people in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then people will be convinced and subdued, both inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We cannot hire people to speak in this way, because such people are a priceless treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord Jesus needs thousands of priceless treasures who manifest their function.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Cooperating with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>by Praying Desperately</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is not a tough requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Some may say that this is too difficult and that I want to reap where I did not sow and to gather where I did not winnow.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But the Lord Jesus has already winnowed, and the harvest is ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There are millions of fish in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>As long as we go out, we will catch a few.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This word is fair.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Our need today is to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We need to be determined to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we do not practice, we need to fast, and if our labor has no result, we should also fast.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should say, Lord, I am fasting because my work is not effective, but the work of the other saints is effective.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>To fast is to refuse to eat before God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God loves us, and He is concerned when we do not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we have this kind of desperation, our work will be effective.</S>
