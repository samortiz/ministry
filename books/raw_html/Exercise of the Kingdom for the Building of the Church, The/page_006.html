         <h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AND THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>As we have seen, all that God is, is embodied in the Son and all that God does is related to Christ, the anointed One. God&rsquo;s plan, His activity, and the accomplishment of His will are involved with Christ. Whatever God is&mdash;life, light, holiness, righteousness, love, kindness&mdash;is embodied in the Son. When we see the vision of this, we receive the Son and have life. We are also attached to Christ, the anointed One, and become part of the corporate Christ, the Body, the church. Such a church is the kingdom. The kingdom is composed of many transformed sons of Jonah. Simon was not a part of the kingdom, but Peter was. The son of flesh and blood is not part of the kingdom, but the son of the living God is. Are you a son of Jonah or a son of God? Are you part of Jonah or part of the anointed One? If you are a son of the living God and if you are a part of the anointed One, you are in the kingdom.</p>
<p>As the church, we are on the defensive, but as the kingdom, we are on the offensive. The Lord said, &ldquo;On this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). In this verse the gates of Hades are on the offensive, and the church is on the defensive. But when we are the kingdom, we are on the offensive, binding and loosing. Whenever we are sons of blood and flesh, we are food for Satan, for Satan eats the flesh. When we are sons of Jonah, we cannot shut the gates of Hades. But when we are Peters, not Simons, and are constituted with the Son of God and the Christ, we are no longer Satan&rsquo;s food. Rather, we are those who shut the gates of Hades and block the power of darkness. If we are the church against which the power of darkness cannot prevail, then we are the kingdom. Instead of waiting for the gates of Hades to attack us, we bind the gates and shut them. We are able to command Satan to flee. Today we are both the church and the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM AS THE TRANSFIGURATION OF JESUS</h2>
<p>In Matthew 16:28 the Lord said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.&rdquo; Then in 17:1 and 2 the Lord was transfigured on the mountain before Peter, James, and John. This indicates that His transfiguration was His coming in His kingdom. Before He was transfigured, there was no kingdom, because He was still a natural Nazarene. But when He was transfigured and entered into another realm, the realm of transfiguration, that realm became the kingdom. Hence, the kingdom is the transfiguration of Jesus.</p>
<p>We need to apply this principle to ourselves. When we are natural, we are sons of Jonah, not part of the kingdom. But when we are transformed into Peters, we have the keys of the kingdom, which were given not to Simon, but to Peter. The keys of the kingdom were not given to the natural man, but to one who had been reconstituted and transformed. When Simon was transformed into Peter, he immediately received the keys of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECONSTITUTED<br />
THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Prior to chapter sixteen, the Lord Jesus said nothing to His disciples about His crucifixion and resurrection. Only after they had seen Christ and the church, did He reveal His cross and resurrection to them. Apart from the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, it is impossible for any son of Jonah to be reconstituted. Rather, every natural man would remain the same. A son of Jonah can be transformed and reconstituted only through the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. Through death and resurrection Simon Bar-jona became Peter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRANSFERRED BY DRINKING</h2>
<p>We need to understand how we are transferred from a son of Jonah to a Peter. As the rock, the Lord Jesus was cleft, and living water flowed out of Him. We have pointed out that the cleaving of the rock signifies the crucifixion of Christ and that the flowing out of the living water signifies His resurrection. When the Lord appeared to His disciples on the day of His resurrection, the mark of the cleft was still visible in His side (John 20:20). By Christ&rsquo;s being cleft, not only was the veil removed, but the living water was released. Living water is still flowing out of the Lord&rsquo;s side today. Today Christ is the life-giving Spirit in resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45). Because He is the Spirit, we can drink of Him. On the day we began to drink of Him, we were transferred from Simon to Peter. Moreover, by continuing to drink of Him we were solidly founded upon the rock, which is the crucified and resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Christ is the flowing water; on the other hand, He is the rock. According to the principle of first mention, the significance of the rock in the Old Testament is the fact that it is cleft so that water can flow out. Eventually, this cleft rock flowing with water becomes the foundation stone for God&rsquo;s building. Today nearly all Christians know that Christ is the rock upon which the church is built and that He is the foundation of the church (1 Cor. 3:11). However, not many know the significance of Christ as the rock and the foundation. The significance is that the rock firstly is cleft so that the living water can flow out. Then as we drink of this flowing water, the cleft rock becomes our foundation, and we are solidly founded upon it. By drinking of the water from the cleft rock, we are transferred from Simon to Peter and we are founded upon the crucified and resurrected Christ. Within us we have the flowing water, and beneath us we have the solid rock.</p>
<p>Being founded on the rock is not merely a matter of becoming a Christian and then coming together with other Christians. That is human organization. To repeat, Christ was cleft to flow out the essence of God as the living water to be our life. Today He is the cleft and resurrected Christ. When we see this vision, we respond to Him and drink Him in. I did this more than fifty years ago, although I did not know the meaning of what I had done. But as I recall my experience at the time I was saved, I realize now that I took a good drink of Christ and was watered within. Furthermore, I was transferred out of Simon into Peter. Although I was still muddy, the transfer had in fact taken place. Furthermore, at that time I became solidly founded upon the rock. Before I was saved, I was like a piece of driftwood. But after I received the Lord, I was founded on the cleft and flowing rock, on the crucified and resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>When we are transferred and founded, we become the church and we are no longer food for Satan. Because our constituent has been changed, Satan can no longer eat us. If Satan tries to eat us, he will say, &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to eat this! Once you were so tasteful to me, but not anymore.&rdquo; Many times I have said to Satan, &ldquo;Satan, you don&rsquo;t want me, and I don&rsquo;t want you. I command you to leave.&rdquo; When this is our condition, we are not only the church on the defensive, but also the kingdom on the offensive.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REACTING TO WHAT WE SEE</h2>
<p>Are you a Simon or a Peter? If you are a Peter, then one day you saw the Christ, the Son of the living God, and you reacted to what you saw. You could not deny what you had seen. Some reacted by praying, others by crying, and still others by confessing how sinful they were. Our reaction depends upon what we see. Your reaction was your drinking of Christ. By drinking Him, you received Him. In other words, by your reaction, by your drinking, the Son of the living God came into you. He will never leave you, although there may be times when you think you want Him to leave. By our drinking of Him, the Son of the living God has been brought into our being, and we have been solidly founded upon the crucified and resurrected Christ. This is the constituent of the church. When we are such a church, we are spontaneously the kingdom.</p>
<p>The kingdom is both the transfiguration of Jesus and the transformation of so many sons of Jonah into Peters. All these sons of Jonah have been reconstituted to become not only the church on the defensive, but also the kingdom on the offensive. The Lord was cleft in His crucifixion and flowed out the living water in His resurrection. When we saw this vision, we reacted to Him and drank Him in.</p>
<p>If you never see anything, you will not have any reactions. For example, as you drive along the highway, you react to the scenery. The aim of this ministry is to cause you to react. The more reaction, the better, for when you react, you drink. Every reaction is a drink that causes a further transfer and transformation. Some may not care whether or not they attend the meetings of the church. Those who stay home from the meetings are like those who never travel anywhere. Because they stay home, they see nothing new and hence have no reactions. We need to take a new way. Then we shall have one reaction after another. It does make a difference whether or not we come to the meetings, for in the meetings we will see things that cause us to react; and whenever we react, we drink. By drinking, we are transformed.</p>
<p>Have you seen that all that God is, is embodied in the Son? If you see this, you will react. Have you seen that all that God does is related to Christ, the anointed One? If you see this, you also will react. Have you seen that on the day of resurrection Peter received the Son of God and that on the day of Pentecost he was attached to the anointed One? Anyone who sees this will have a strong reaction and be changed. After you have seen this, it will not be so easy for you to be the same as you were before. We need to have more reactions so that we may experience a further transfer from Simon to Peter. This transfer is for the church and the kingdom.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
