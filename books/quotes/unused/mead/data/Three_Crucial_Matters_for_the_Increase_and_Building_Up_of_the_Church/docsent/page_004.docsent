   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO HOME MEETINGS AND TRUTH LESSONS Scripture Reading: Heb 10:25; 2 Tim 2:2, 15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we join the Lord s army, we must know how to serve in order to be for the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must not forget the three crucial matters for the increase and building up of the church, namely, begetting, nourishing, and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The gospel is for begetting, the home meetings are for nourishing, and Truth Lessons is for teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Last year the church in Taipei was successful in spreading the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we must improve, just as the methods of transportation are constantly being improved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There was a time when ox carts were used for transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we have jumbo jets that can fly directly from Los Angeles to Taipei in only thirteen hours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, a person flying in an airplane can move around freely because airplanes are very stable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is an improvement in transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, we should not cling to and continue to meet in our old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the past we had only four kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There was the big meeting on Lord s Day morning that was mainly for listening to famous speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a well-known brother spoke, more people attended the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The next kind of meeting was the gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The third kind of meeting was the table meeting to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fourth kind of meeting was the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church, however, is a home, and homes are for begetting and nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These four kinds of meetings are not related to the functions of begetting and nourishing in a home.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE FUTURE OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING ON</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BEGETTING, NOURISHING, AND TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though we did not preach the gospel much in the past, some people were saved, but not many of them remained in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I left Taipei in 1961, there were more than twenty thousand people in our records.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I returned in 1984, there were only eleven thousand people in our records.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church baptized many people during the past twenty-three years, but when we subtract the number of saints who moved abroad, those who went to be with the Lord, those who became cold and backslidden, and those with whom we lost contact, we find that our numbers have decreased, not increased.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is because the church lacks nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is easy for a mother to give birth to a child, but it is not so easy for her to nourish that child.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In nourishing the child, a mother needs to feed it, change its diaper at night, and even endure its crying.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without nourishing, however, the child will not grow up to become a healthy member of society.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we preach the gospel, we beget many children, but if we do not nourish and teach them, they will not be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Taiwan today every family pays much attention to raising and educating their children; they even give their children a high level of education.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is no wonder that Taiwan is improving.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church is not a society, but it is a corporate group.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we desire those who are gained through our preaching of the gospel to remain in the church, we must nourish and teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many brothers and sisters have been saved for many years and have listened to messages week after week, but they cannot clearly explain the basic truths, such as justification by faith, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, some of the young brothers and sisters can explain these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows that there is potential with the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is an enormous need today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who are able to speak many languages can travel all over the world to preach the gospel and expound the truth in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brother John Nelson Darby is a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was fluent in five languages English, French, German, Greek, and Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the Lord was able to use him to translate the entire Bible into English, French, and German.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A normal church must have begetting, nourishing, and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A church that can only beget but cannot nourish or teach has no future.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not look to our past success or simply give messages on being spiritual, loving the Lord, bearing the cross, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have been preaching these things for more than ten years, but the brothers and sisters are still not sufficiently nourished or educated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever the church lacks nourishing and teaching, it has no way to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our goals today are spreading the gospel, building up home meetings, and teaching the truth with Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words, our goals are begetting, nourishing, and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to speak this to the saints until they are impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The elders, co-workers, and full-timers need to learn how to speak these three goals in a clear and strong way.</S>
