   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Being Called out of Egypt</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Soon after Jesus was born, magi from the east went to Jerusalem, seeking to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When King Herod heard of this, he was troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He inquired of the birth place of Jesus and then secretly called the magi to determine accurately from them the time that the star appeared in order to destroy Him Matt 2:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Joseph arose and took the child and His mother by night and departed into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They stayed there until Herod died vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This fulfilled the prophecy of the prophet Hosea: When Israel was a child, I loved him, / And out of Egypt I called My son 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hosea s prophecy not only explains the fact that Joseph took Mary and Jesus and fled into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It further reveals that in Christ s first coming He was in union with Israel as the Son of God by fleeing to Egypt and by being called out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the matter of being the Son of God, Christ was joined to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although Israel became exceedingly evil, Christ still became organically one with them through incarnation to be a real Israelite.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. Growing Up in Nazareth of Galilee</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the death of King Herod, who sought the life of Jesus, Joseph and Mary took Jesus and returned to Galilee, settling in Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene Matt 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word prophets, in plural, indicates that this is not a particular prophecy but a summary of the significance of several prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The title Nazarene may refer to the branch in Isaiah 11:1, which in Hebrew is netzer .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The branch there, signifying Christ, is a sprout out of the stump of Jesse, the father of David.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the time Jesus was born, the throne of David had been overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the royal stem of David had been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now a new sprout came forth from the stump of Jesse and grew out of his roots.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This sprouting and growing were in a situation of humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jesus was not born in a recognized and honored royal home, nor did He grow up in a renowned city such as Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, He was born in a poor home and grew up in a despised town.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All this made Him a Nazarene, a branch not a lofty branch of a stately tree, but a seemingly insignificant sprout from the stump of Jesse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although Jesus was a Nazarene, within Him was the Spirit of God, the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the prophet Isaiah prophesied, Then a sprout will come forth from the stump of Jesse, / And a branch from his roots will bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>/ And the Spirit of Jehovah will rest upon Him, / The Spirit of wisdom and understanding, / The Spirit of counsel and might, / The Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah Isa 11:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit of counsel and might here equals the wisdom and power in 1 Corinthians 1:24, which tells us that Christ is God s power and God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is the wisdom which gives counsel and the power which gives might.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What a humble yet precious Savior He is!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>D. Growing Up Like a Tender Plant</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>and a Root out of Dry Ground,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Having No Attracting Form nor Majesty</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Isaiah 53:2 prophesies of Christ, saying, He grew up like a tender plant before Him, / And like a root out of dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>/ He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, / Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Bible plants often typify humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For Christ to grow up like a tender plant before Jehovah means that Christ grew up before Him in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In His divinity Christ has always been perfect and complete, and thus there was no need for Him to grow in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, He needed to grow in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, He was born as a child, and then He grew up into boyhood and eventually into manhood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He grew up in humanity not only like a tender plant but also like a root out of dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Dry ground signifies a difficult environment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our Lord was born to a poor carpenter s family, became the son of a carpenter, and grew up in the city of Nazareth of the despised region of Galilee John 1:46; Matt 13:53-57 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Like a root out of dry ground, He grew up in the midst of hard circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not have a physically attractive form nor an appearance that people would desire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Isaiah 52:14 says, Even as many were astonished at Him / His visage was marred more than that of any man, / And His form more than that of the sons of men.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Jews thought the Messiah would be admired by people, like Moses and David, who were attractive in appearance Acts 7:20; 1 Sam 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Jews also thought that when the Messiah came, there would be the royal scepter, an open ceremony, and the support of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But they never thought the Messiah, the anointed One of God, Christ the Servant of God, would grow up in Nazareth of Galilee like a root out of dry ground.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His visage and form were marred, having no attractiveness or majesty, such that He was reckoned as nearly fifty years old when He was thirty John 8:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This certainly astonished the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our Lord is altogether lovely, altogether beautiful, and altogether rich, but these features are not visible to the naked eyes; only spiritual eyes can see them.</S>
