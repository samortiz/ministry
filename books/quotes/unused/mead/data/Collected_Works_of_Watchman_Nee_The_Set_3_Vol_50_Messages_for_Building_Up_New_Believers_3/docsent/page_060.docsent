   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HOW GOD ARRANGES EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How does God arrange everything for our good?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everyone is different in nature, character, living, and habit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why we all need a different kind of breaking work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The kinds of discipline that God arranges are as varied as the number of people there are.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everyone is put into a different set of situations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A husband and a wife may be very close to each other, yet God will arrange a different environment for each of them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A father and a son, or a mother and a daughter, may likewise be very close to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet God arranges a different environment for each of them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In operating through our environment, God measures discipline to each one of us according to our individual needs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every arrangement of God is with the view of training us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Greek all things means "everything."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All does not mean a hundred thousand things or even a million things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot tell how big the number is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everything, all things, are arranged by God for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, nothing comes to us by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With us there is no coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All things are arranged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From our point of view, our experience may seem confusing and puzzling; we may not see the intrinsic meaning behind everything, and we may not understand what it means.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But God's Word says that all things work together for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not know what thing will bring us what kind of good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Neither do we know how many things are waiting for us and what good we will gain from them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But there is one thing we do know: Everything works together for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nothing will happen to us that does not bring us good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must see clearly that God's arrangement is to produce holiness in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not work out this holiness in ourselves; God is the One who creates this holy character in us through our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One illustration will serve to explain how all things work together for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Hangchow there are many silk weavers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Weaving involves many threads and colors.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If one looks at the fabric from the back, everything seems to be a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>An outsider will be puzzled; he will not know what pattern is on the other side of the fabric.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if he turns the fabric right side up, he will find beautiful figures, flowers, mountains, or rivers on it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nothing is clear while the fabric is being woven; one sees only red and green threads moving back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, our experience seemingly moves back and forth like a puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not know what design God has in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But every "thread" which God uses, every discipline from His hand, has its function.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every color is there for a purpose, and the design is prearranged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God arranges our environment for the purpose of creating holiness in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every encounter is meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may not be clear today, but one day we will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some of the things may not look that nice at the moment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But when we look back after some time, we will surely know why the Lord has done what He has done and what His purpose was for doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>OUR ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What should our attitude be when we face all these things?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Romans 8:28 says, "All things work together for good to those who love God."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In other words, when God works, it is possible for us to receive the good, and it is also possible for us not to receive the good.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is quite related to our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our attitude even determines how soon we will receive the good.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If our attitude is right, we will receive the good immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we love God, everything that is of God will work for our good.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a man claims that he has no choice of his own, that he asks nothing for himself, and that he only wants everything that God gives to him, he should have only one desire in his heart to love God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If he loves the Lord in his heart, all of the things around him will work together in love and for his good, no matter how confusing they may seem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When something happens to us and we do not have the love of God within us, when we crave and seek things for ourselves, or when we pursue private interests apart from God, the good that God has reserved for us will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are very good at complaining, struggling, murmuring, and groaning about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers and sisters, please bear in mind that although all things do work together for good, we will not receive the good immediately if our hearts do not love God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many of God's children have indeed encountered many problems, but they have not received any good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They experience much discipline, and God has arranged many things around them, but these things do not result in any riches on their part.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The only reason for this poverty is that they have other goals besides God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Their hearts are not pliable towards God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They do not feel God's love; neither do they love God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They have a wrong attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a result, they may have received many dealings, yet nothing remains in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May God be merciful to us that we learn to love Him from our hearts as soon as we become Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Being short in knowledge does not mean much, because the way to know God lies in love, not in knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If a man loves God, he will know God even though he may lack knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, if he knows much but does not love God in his heart, all of his knowledge will not help him to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is a good line in one hymn: "To bring thee to thy God,/Love takes the shortest route" Hymns, #477 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If a man loves God, whatever he encounters will turn out to his good.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our heart must love God, and we must learn to know His hand and humble ourselves under it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we do not see His hand, our eyes will be distracted by men.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We will feel that others are wrong or have betrayed us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We will feel that our brothers, sisters, siblings, parents, and friends are all wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As we condemn everyone, we fall into disappointment and disillusion ourselves, and nothing works to our good.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we say that the brothers and sisters in the church are all wrong and that nothing is right and everything is wrong, we are gaining nothing for ourselves except anger and criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we remember the Lord Jesus' word, that "not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father" Matt 10:29 , and if we realize that everything is of God, we will humble ourselves under His hand and receive the good.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Psalm 39:9 says, "I was dumb; I did not open my mouth; /For You have done this."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the attitude of one who obeys God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Because God has done it and because God has allowed it to come upon us for our good, we humble ourselves and say nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We will not say, "Why did that happen to others, and why is this happening to me?"</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we love God and know His hand, we will not open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In this way we will witness God's breaking and constituting work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Some may ask, "Should we accept everything from Satan's hand too?"</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The basic principle is that we will take whatever God allows to come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As for attacks from Satan, we have to resist.</S>
