        <h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO WALK BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Things from the past, whether right or wrong, are part of the old man and are the issue of not living in the spirit, not living by Christ. From this point forward we must live by Christ and not talk about the past. After believing in the Lord, our unique sin is to not live by the Lord. We need to confess this sin, saying, &ldquo;Lord, from morning to evening I do not live by You, I do not speak by You, I do not pray-read by You, and I do not even meet by You. Lord, forgive me for living in myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one can learn in a quick way; if we want to learn, we must be serious and practice. A child does not learn to walk by learning teachings; instead, he practices to walk and learns by walking. Since we have seen this vision, we must get up and walk. If we see that Christ is living in us, we must live by Christ from morning to evening. If we do not live by the Lord, we must confess and say, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I loved people today but not by You; I prayed today but not by You. Lord, forgive me.&rdquo; Actually, if we are willing to learn, we will be able to walk tomorrow and walk even better the next day. It is regrettable that we have not yet learned to walk by living in the spirit.</p>
<p>We must practice this and forget about everything old. We must say, &ldquo;Praise and thank the Lord! In my living, it is no longer I who live. It is my gracious Lord, the all-inclusive Spirit, who is living in my spirit, and I am living one with Him.&rdquo; It is simple to live one with the Lord, but it often seems difficult because we are unwilling to drop our routines. Christ is new every day, and as long as we live by Him and not by our routines, we will grow in life, the church life will be blessed, and others will be helped.</p>
<p>We do not need to engage in idle words, murmurings, or reasonings. We should just live by the Lord. The Lord Jesus never spoke idle words based on reasonings; He did not blame others, engage in power struggles, or rely upon diplomacy. Such a Christ is our center. While there are many teachings in the Bible, such as teachings on holiness, the cross, victory, and spirituality, a singular pursuit of these teachings proves that we are not living in the spirit. If we are truly living in the spirit, we have everything that we need.</p>
<p>The Holy of Holies in the Old Testament typifies our spirit. The altar and the laver in the outer court point to our need of dealing and cleansing, and the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar in the Holy Place were tended to by the priests. God&rsquo;s presence, however, was in the Holy of Holies, and to enter into the Holy of Holies was to be one with God. The central mystery in the New Testament is the Holy of Holies, and Paul&rsquo;s ministry brings us into the reality of the Holy of Holies. In Galatians 5:24 Paul says, &ldquo;They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.&rdquo; Then, in the following verse, he mentions a crucial point, saying, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit&rdquo; (v. 25). In Romans 6:6 Paul mentions a similar point, saying, &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him.&rdquo; Based on this fact, Paul says that every Christian should reckon himself to be &ldquo;dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (v. 11). We need to confess this fact: Since we are in Christ, we have been crucified with Him. Thus, according to the fact, we are dead. In Romans 8:4 Paul addresses our practical living, speaking of the righteous requirement of the law being fulfilled in us, &ldquo;who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.&rdquo; This is a word according to the central vision. In Ephesians Paul does not speak about reckoning ourselves as dead but, instead, of the Father strengthening us with power through His Spirit into our inner man so that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (3:16-17, 19). This is the positive expression of Christ being in us.</p>
<p>Although messages related to these points have been shared, the messages have been ignored. This indicates that we have left the Holy of Holies and gone back to the outer court. We should stay in the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies has equal dimensions related to its breadth, length, and height (Exo. 26:2-8; 1 Kings 6:20). According to the revelation of the Bible, the New Jerusalem is an enlargement of the Holy of Holies, because the dimensions of its breadth, length, and height are the same (Rev. 21:16, 22). Today the church is the Holy of Holies, and our spirit is the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies there is only God. When we have God, we have His presence, and when we live in the Lord and abide in the Lord, we are delivered from the world and the self.</p>
<p>We must see that the church needs &ldquo;meals&rdquo; that actually benefit the saints. Children grow gradually by receiving nutrients through their daily meals. The church is not like a candy store that provides only sweet-tasting things. The church is like a family that relies upon healthy, nutritious food day after day. The church does not need eloquent messages, and those who can only speak eloquent messages ruin the church. In contrast, some who can only stammer through their speaking can supply the Christ whom they have experienced. The church does not need slogans based on eloquence, doctrines, or even Bible knowledge. The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body needs food; the church is the new man, and the new man needs nutritious food.</p>
<p>Christ is our life, and the church is our living. Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit living in our spirit, and our spirit is the Holy of Holies. We must live in the spirit and help the saints to live in the spirit. Then we will be the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, the Lord&rsquo;s bride. The Lord has not come back because He has not gained what He is after. Revelation 19:7 says, &ldquo;His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; The Lord will come back when His wife is ready.</p>

 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
