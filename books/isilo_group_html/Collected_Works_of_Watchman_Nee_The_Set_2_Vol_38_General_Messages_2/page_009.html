Instead, expect to meet Christ. Listening to a message is not for the purpose of satisfying the intellect but for the purpose of receiving the supply of life. Some people can give very thoughtful, clever, and persuasive messages. Yet they produce no spiritual result. We should not admire this kind of message. The kind of messages that we need are those that enable us to touch something spiritual in an inward way; they must be messages that allow us to touch the Christ behind the words. These words carry life and power, and they bring about a spiritual change as well as an increase of spiritual stature in a person. We have to ask the Lord to give us the grace to have the power of discernment so that we will pursue after the right things.</p><p>(2) When we hear something we do not understand, we should wait humbly for the Lord's timing because spiritual understanding has quite much to do with spiritual age. We may not understand it now, but we may understand it a few years later. We should never criticize lightly the things we do not understand, lest we suffer a loss. On the other hand, never think that any spiritual thing is so easy and that we understand it all. We have to realize that it may have taken others a few years to learn certain lessons before they could deliver the messages they are giving.</p><p>(3) Beware of substitutes. When a person is talking about a deer, we may understand it to be a horse. Actually the two things are absolutely different. For example, when we talk about "reality," we are referring to the things that the Holy Spirit reveals to us in Christ. But many people (even those who have been workers for years) have taken practicality to mean reality. If practicality is reality, the men in 1 Corinthians 13:3 have the most reality. But actually, they had no reality at all. (Of course, those who have reality have practicality also.) For example, when some say that they have received light, they mean they have received a new idea in their mind, a concept which they think is reasonable. The source is the intellect, and it is powerless. Other people think that light comes when the eyes see certain physical rays. But none of this is light. The genuine light of life comes from the revelation of the Spirit and is understood in the mind afterwards. It is something real that we see; it is a spiritual reality which the Spirit unveils to us, and it comes with power. Some brothers have stated that with light there is killing, shining, and burning, and it results in a change in life. For example, when a man is saved, the Spirit enlightens him and shows him his sins. He realizes the evil of his sins. He feels ashamed and hates his sins. The sins that we confess under the light can be far more numerous than the sins we know in our mind. This is the light of life. Unfortunately, some have substitutes and have not seen anything genuine. Therefore, we have to humble ourselves and not think that we understand and know everything.</p><p>(4) We should humble ourselves before God and pray for the speaker. We should pray that God will release the word of life. We should also pray for the audience and ourselves so that the words we hear will penetrate the depth of our being and become revelation and light to us and that the church will grow in the stature of Christ. This is the cooperation a listener can render to the speaker.</p><p>Finally, may the Lord be merciful to us, so that we realize that God alone is the One who can accomplish His work; we are merely speaking what we see through revelation. May we learn to cooperate with God, to remove all hindrances, to change nothing of the pattern on the mount, and to be purified by the light until we are free from all mixture. We need to always look to Him, always trust in Him, and acknowledge with fear and trembling that "we are unprofitable slaves" (Luke 17:10).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 38: General Messages (2) &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
