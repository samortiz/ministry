[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE ONE INTRODUCTION 1 Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[2]  1:1-3; Num 4:2-3; 1 Chron 23:3a; Luke 3:23a; Ezek.
[3]  Our goal is not to research this book or to expound it but to see the visions of God s glorious life contained in it.
[4]  In this story God enters into man to be man s life, causing man to have His nature and His glorious image.
[5]  Both books speak of God being life to man, of the Spirit of life, of the flow of the water of life, and of God s people, who have His glorious likeness, becoming His dwelling place.
[6]  These two books, which end with a vision of Jerusalem, tell us that God s intention is to come into us as life that we may have His nature and image so that, in His nature with His image, we who have Him as our life may be built up together as the holy city to be God s dwelling place for eternity.
[7]  The most important similarity is that the prophet Ezekiel and the apostle John were both priests before God.
[8]  In Revelation 5:10 the apostle John speaks of God s redeemed people being priests to God.
[9]  This means that God s purpose, His intention, is that we and He would have the same life, nature, and image and that eventually, we and He, He and we, would be mingled together as one entity with two natures, the divine nature and the human nature, in order to be built together as God s eternal dwelling place.
[10]  The book of Ezekiel shows us the same picture in a condensed way, revealing that God s intention is to work Himself into us as our life and to mingle Himself with us that we might be built together in Him as life to be His eternal habitation.
[11]  We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the Bible as a whole and the book of Ezekiel as a miniature of the Bible reveal that God s intention is to dispense Himself into us as our life that we may have His divine nature and bear His glorious image.
[12]  Through the coordination of the living creatures, God is able to move and administrate.
[13]  Just as Ezekiel had to be mature in order to serve as a priest, to see the visions, to prepare Christ as the offerings for others enjoyment, to enjoy the riches of Christ, and to express the fullness of Christ, so we also need to be matured in our spiritual life so that we can see the visions concerning Christ and His Body, prepare Christ for others enjoyment, and enjoy all the riches of Christ to become the fullness of Christ as His expression.
[14]  Ezekiel goes on to speak of the fifth year.
[15]  The next point to consider is the person Ezekiel who saw the visions.
[16]  As a priest Ezekiel was one who lived in the presence of God, serving God and being mingled with God.
[17]  Finally, regarding the introduction in 1:1-3 we need to consider the conditions for seeing the visions.
[18]  In the land of captivity there was a man, Ezekiel, who was mature and who was one with God, and the heavens were opened to him.
[19]  God not only gave His visions to Ezekiel He also gave him His words.
[20]  God s words are His explanations, which cause us to hear something.
[21]  Because God wanted Ezekiel not only to behold with his eyes but also to hear with his ears 40:4 , He gave him words along with His visions.
[22]  The words in Ezekiel are God s special words, which came in a particular way to a man who was in close contact with God.
[23]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE THREE THE WIND, THE CLOUD, THE FIRE,
[24]  The first part of Ezekiel 1:4 says, I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north.
[25]  John Nelson Darby s New Translation and the American Standard Version both translate the Hebrew word rendered whirlwind as stormy wind, and I feel that this translation is preferable.
[26]  According to church history, throughout all the generations the Spirit of God has blown like a mighty wind to move people to repent of their sins, to believe in the Lord Jesus for their regeneration, to give up the world in order to follow the Lord, and to be desperate in heart and burning in spirit to serve the Lord.
[27]  Have you not sensed, at least once in your life, that a certain power the stormy wind from God was moving upon you, causing you to hate sin, to have a different attitude toward the world, or to change your view concerning your life?
[28]  If we have the wind, we will surely have the cloud, for the cloud is the issue of the blowing of the wind.
[29]  Ezekiel saw that the cloud which overshadowed him was covered with fire flashing continually.
[30]  When the stormy wind comes from the Lord and the overshadowing presence of the Lord remains, we have the sense that something within us is shining, searching, and burning.
[31]  God s intention is not simply to burn us and turn us into ashes.
[32]  What is His purpose in blowing upon us as the wind, in covering us as the cloud, and in consuming us as the fire?
[33]  The One on the throne is not just God and not just the Lamb but the Lamb-God, the redeeming God.
[34]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE FOUR THE WIND, THE CLOUD, THE FIRE, AND THE ELECTRUM BEING A CHRISTIAN S SPIRITUAL LIFE STORY Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[35]  We thank the Lord that in the fire there is the glowing electrum.
[36]  I would remind you that the electrum, an alloy of gold and silver, signifies the redeeming God.
[37]  This means that once we have experienced the wind, the cloud, and the fire, the only thing that remains is the glowing electrum, the redeeming God.
[38]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE FIVE THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[39]  1:5-6, 10, 26; Rev 5:9b; John 5:25; Col 2:12-13; Phil 2:7-8; Mark 10:45; Rev 5:5; Exo 19:4; Isa 40:31; Phil 1:21
[40]  We have considered four of these figures the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum which depict what God is to us.
[41]  In our experience of Him, God is like a blowing wind, like a brooding, hovering, and overshadowing cloud, like a flashing, enlightening, searching, and consuming fire Heb 12:29 , which sanctifies us by burning us, and like the glowing, shining electrum.
[42]  The electrum, composed of the elements of gold and silver, signifies the compound God, the Lamb-God Rev 22:1 .
[43]  It is significant that verse 5 speaks of four living creatures.
[44]  Revelation 5:9 says that the Lord has redeemed us out of four sources: out of every tribe, tongue, people, and nation.
[45]  The fact that four living creatures bear the appearance of a man and that God on the throne also bears the appearance of a man indicates that God s central thought and His arrangement are related to man.
[46]  Likewise, when we read about the miracle of the Lord s feeding more than five thousand people with five loaves and two fish, we may feel that this was something great, but we may have no appreciation for His ordering the people to sit down in groups or for His directing the disciples to gather the broken pieces left over so that nothing would be lost.
[47]  If we saw someone with four faces, we would be frightened, yet this is exactly what we should be.
[48]  We also need to bear the face of a lion.
[49]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE SIX EAGLE S WINGS, MAN S HANDS, AND CALF S HOOFS Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[50]  1:6b-9a, 11b; Isa 40:31; 2 Cor 4:7; 1:12; 12:9; 1 Cor 15:10; Phil 4:13; Psa 17:8b; 57:1b; Acts 20:34; Col 3:9; Psa 29:6a; Rev 1:15
[51]  If we would understand the spiritual significance of the eagle s wings, the man s hands, and the calf s hoofs, we need to remember the significance of the blowing of the wind, the hovering and brooding of the cloud, and the consuming, searching, enlightening, and burning of the fire, out of which comes the glowing electrum.
[52]  In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul says, By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.
[53]  In our Christian life we all should bear four wings on four sides, showing others that whatever we are and whatever we do is not by ourselves and is not of ourselves but of God, so that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.
[54]  Each of the four living creatures had four wings, two for covering and two for moving.
[55]  Let us now go on to consider the calf s hoofs, a matter of particular importance in the vision recorded in Ezekiel 1.
[56]  Ezekiel 1:7 tells us that the calf s hoofs sparkled like the color of burnished brass.
[57]  This indicates that we need a walk that has been tested and burned by the Lord.
[58]  Likewise, if we have the proper discernment concerning what the genuine church life is and if we have been tested and examined by the Lord in the church life, then our walk in the church life will be like shining brass, enlightening others and testing them.
[59]  We should also practice this kind of coordination in the meetings.
[60]  At this point we need to consider the issue, the result, of the coordination of the four living creatures the burning coals and the burning torches.
[61]  Concerning the vision in chapter one of Ezekiel, we have paid close attention to the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, to the four faces of the living creatures the faces of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle and to the eagle s wings, the man s hands, and the calf s hoofs.
[62]  It is crucial for us to realize that Ezekiel 1 shows us the desire of God s heart and unveils to us the purpose that God wants to accomplish.
[63]  However, if we read this chapter carefully, we will see that it speaks of God s desire to be expressed in His Son.
[64]  By His blood the Lord has purchased us for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation Rev 5:9 .
[65]  No matter what our race or nationality may be, we all are out of Christ and we can coordinate together as one entity in Christ.
[66]  If we were not of Christ and if we were not in Christ, we could not coordinate together.
[67]  The basis of our coordination is that we are out of Christ, that we have the life of Christ, and that we wish to glorify Christ and express Christ.
[68]  Now we need to see the prerequisites of coordination.
[69]  In order to coordinate with other Christians, we need to pass through the experience of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum to become living creatures bearing a human image and, in the grace of the Lord, manifesting Christ in four aspects as a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle.
[70]  In order to participate in the coordination of the living creatures, we must have the hands of a man.
[71]  This means that we need to be a proper man.
[72]  The second aspect of the practical condition of coordination is walking according to the Spirit Ezek.
[73]  This indicates that if we, as living creatures in Christ, would be coordinated, we must walk by the Spirit Gal 5:16, 25 .
[74]  Finally, we need to see the various aspects of the result of coordination.
[75]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE NINE THE HIGH AND DREADFUL WHEELS Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[76]  If we live out the expression of Christ, we will have the wheel of the Lord s move.
[77]  Verse 18b goes on to say, And their rings were full of eyes round about them four.
[78]  If we apply this to our spiritual experience, we will realize that it is absolutely correct to say that the wheels are full of eyes.
[79]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TEN A SKY AS CLEAR AS THE TERRIBLE CRYSTAL Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[80]  These verses tell us that upon the heads of the four living creatures there is the firmament, or the expanse, which we call the sky.
[81]  If we are under a clear and expanding sky, we can have the adequate and proper coordination, a coordination that is altogether straight.
[82]  Verse 24 says also that this voice is the voice of the Almighty.
[83]  It is the voice of a corporate body, but eventually this voice becomes the voice of God.
[84]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE ELEVEN THE THRONE ABOVE THE CLEAR SKY Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[85]  In the vision in chapter one things in the natural realm are used to describe things in the spiritual realm.
[86]  According to God s plan the spiritual things revealed here begin with the wind v. 4 and end with the rainbow v. 28 . As we will see in the next message, there is a rainbow that manifests God s splendor.
[87]  The highest step in the spiritual experience of a Christian is to have the throne in our firmament, in our clear sky.
[88]  To have the throne, or to arrive at the throne, is to allow God to have the highest and most prominent position in our Christian life.
[89]  For God to have the throne in us means that He has the position to reign in us.
[90]  Therefore, to reach the throne in our spiritual experience means that in everything we are completely submissive to God s authority and administration.
[91]  Whether the brothers and sisters listen to you or not, depends on where you are and on what you are.
[92]  If you are under a clear sky, there is no need for you to argue, and there is no need for you to claim anything or even say anything.
[93]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TWELVE THE MAN ON THE THRONE Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[94]  1:26-28; Exo 24:10; Gen 9:12-15; Rev 4:2-3; 21:19a; 22:1
[95]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that in the Christian life and in the church life we need a clear sky with a throne in it.
[96]  To have a clear sky means that we have no clouds or darkness between us and the Lord, and to have the throne means that we are under the ruling of the heavens.
[97]  Furthermore, to be a man of God, as Moses was Deut 33:1; Josh 14:6; Psa 90, title , is to be a God-man, a man who is mingled with God.
[98]  God s intention is to work Himself into us, making us the same as He is, and even more, making Himself the same as we are.
[99]  When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was God manifest in the flesh, for He was the God-man and had the appearance of a man.
[100]  Through His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, the Lord Jesus was brought to the throne.
[101]  God has always been the Lord, but now a man is on the throne as the Lord.
[102]  At this point the four living creatures are not only for the manifestation of the Lord and not only for the move of the Lord but also for the administration, the government, of the Lord.
[103]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE DEGRADATION OF GOD S PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[104]  20:6; 6:9; 11:12b; 13:4-5, 17-18; 14:3, 5; 22:25-30; 3:7; 2:3-4, 6; 22:13-19
[105]  As we pointed out in the first message, the book of Ezekiel is of four sections.
[106]  The first section, consisting of chapter one, presents a vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord.
[107]  In this section we see that God judges His people and the heathen nations by Himself as a consuming fire.
[108]  At this juncture we need to consider the rights, privileges, and standing of the people of Israel.
[109]  In His grace and in His care for us, the believers, God has put us into Christ 1 Cor 1:30 , and now He is cultivating us that we may live in union with Christ.
[110]  Unfortunately, the actual condition of Israel was very poor.
[111]  If we read the long record in Ezekiel from chapter two to chapter twenty-four, we may feel like weeping over Israel s pitiful condition.
[112]  How could such a wonderful people who were God s elect, God s vine, God s bride, God s flock, and God s treasure become rebels, briars and thorns, a harlot, scorpions, and dross?
[113]  In order to answer this question, we need to consider the reasons for Israel s degradation.
[114]  Those who set up idols in their hearts are estranged from the Lord through their idols v. 5 . Verse 4 says, Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the Lord will answer him that cometh, according to the multitude of his idols.
[115]  In these verses we see a principle: All those who have idols within them and yet seek God in an outward way cannot find God.
[116]  A scholarship, education, money, clothing, a wife, a husband, children all these can be idols, something or someone that we love more than God and that replaces God in our life.
[117]  Now let us go on to consider the various kinds of people among the children of Israel described in these chapters of Ezekiel.
[118]  Here we see that the priests violated the word of God, profaned the holy things, and even profaned the Lord Himself.
[119]  They minister God s word in a violent way, cheating and misleading others by the wrong use of the Word and profaning the name of God.
[120]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE FOURTEEN GOD S JUDGMENT UPON HIS PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[121]  8:2-4; 9:3a; 11:22-24; 10:2; 22:20-22; 14:21; 12:15; 7:21; 33:21; 3:17; 9:4; 6:8; 11:16-17; 20:40; 17:22-23; 21:10, 27; 29:21
[122]  God judged His people by four terrible things: the sword, famine, pestilence or disease, and wild, noisome beasts 14:21 .
[123]  We praise the Lord that in His judgment there are still His mercy and the visitation of His mercy.
[124]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE FIFTEEN GOD S JUDGMENT UPON THE NATIONS Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[125]  25:2-3, 7-8, 12-16; 26:2, 4; 28:21-22, 24, 26; 29:3, 6-7, 16; 30:6, 10; 31:16, 18
[126]  Ammon and Moab were brothers who were born of Lot by his daughters.
[127]  The sanctuary was a type of the incarnated Christ tabernacling on earth as God s dwelling place, God s sanctuary John 1:14 .
[128]  Thus, the sanctuary signifies Christ, the good land signifies all of God s rich grace in Christ, and the house of Judah signifies the church.
[129]  The Roman Empire hated the incarnated Christ, the tabernacle as God s sanctuary on earth, and it hated the rich grace given by God to His people.
[130]  Tyrus typifies those who are seeking worldly wealth, those who desire to make a great deal of money and to be rich.
[131]  They will sacrifice everything related to the Lord for the sake of their business.
[132]  They do not care for the Lord s interest but care only for their wealth, riches, and business.
[133]  If you speak to them concerning Christ, the church, or the Lord s testimony, they do not understand what you are talking about.
[134]  Now we need to go on to see how God exercised His judgment over these seven nations.
[135]  God executed judgment in four ways: by destroying these nations, by making them desolate, by making them very low, and by delivering them to the nether parts of the earth, that is, to the lower parts of the earth 31:14 .
[136]  If we do not judge our old man, God will exercise His judgment upon us, making us low and down in spirit.
[137]  If we judge our old man, not caring to be first or to have any position in the church, we will be happy in the church life, we will be up, and our spirit will be high.
[138]  If our old man and our natural man destroy the church of God, God will destroy us with our old man and natural man.
[139]  After setting the watchman, God Himself came in to be the Shepherd 34:11-31 .
[140]  In God s recovery by life, He first sends the watchman to His people to repent, turn, and live, and then He Himself appears as the Shepherd.
[141]  The Lord also said that He would bring His people back to the rivers v. 13 . These rivers signify the life-giving Spirit, the living water of the Spirit.
[142]  From the mountains, the resurrected and ascended Christ, the living water of the Spirit flows.
[143]  After the Lord sought us out and brought us back to Himself, we not only returned to Christ in the transcendent position of His ascension, but we also began to drink of the Spirit as the living water.
[144]  While we were in the denominations, we had the sense of dryness and drought, but once we came into the meetings of the local churches, we began to have the sense that we had been brought back to the river and that by this river we were being fed by the Lord Jesus.
[145]  But as the Lord recovers us by life, we have genuine revival, we have the enjoyment of Christ, which causes us to be satisfied, restful, and peaceful, and we experience the Lord s binding and healing.
[146]  Verse 23 goes on to say, And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
[147]  In Ezekiel 34:27 the Lord promised to break all the yokes, including the yokes of sin and the world.
[148]  With Him as our Shepherd, we have no yokes and no bondage.
[149]  The Lord promises that there will be showers of blessing.
[150]  There will be no lack of water, for there will be not only rivers but also showers.
[151]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE OUTWARD AND INWARD RECOVERY BY LIFE Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[152]  34:5, 14, 10, 15; 36:8-12, 15, 22-30, 33-38
[153]  In this message we will consider the matter of the outward and inward recovery by life.
[154]  This recovery continues in chapter thirty-four, where God Himself comes in to be the Shepherd to search for His people, to seek them out, to bring them back, and to cause them to enjoy the riches of Christ signified by the riches of the good land.
[155]  Ezekiel 36:21-23 says, But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.
[156]  Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.
[157]  And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord God, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
[158]  Here we see that in recovering His people, God acts on behalf of His holy name.
[159]  Many of us can testify that we have been recovered and revived not because of any merit in ourselves but because God did something in us for His own name.
[160]  I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land v. 24 . In His recovery, God brings us out from the world and brings us back to our own place.
[161]  The cleansing mentioned above is something on the negative side.
[162]  On the positive side, after the cleansing, the Lord gives us a new heart and a new spirit.
[163]  When we consider how sweet and precious the Lord Jesus is and how much He has done for us, we may become stirred in our emotion and say, Lord Jesus, I love You!
[164]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE DRY BONES, THE TWO STICKS, AND THE ARMY Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[165]  The first section, consisting of chapter one, speaks of the glorious vision of God and reveals the holy God in His glory.
[166]  The second section, composed of chapters two through thirty-two, speaks of God s judgment to deal with all things and matters that do not match His righteousness, holiness, and glory.
[167]  Ezekiel 34 mainly covers outward aspects of the Lord s recovery.
[168]  In this chapter God comes as the Shepherd to search and seek for His people and to bring them back to His good land.
[169]  In His recovery, the Lord not only brings us back outwardly, but He also inwardly gives us a new heart and a new spirit and puts His Spirit into our spirit.
[170]  If we see this, we will realize that the Lord s recovery is not merely a matter of outward position and outward circumstances but also a matter of inward nature and disposition.
[171]  In the Lord s recovery, which is something both outward and inward, not only are our position, circumstances, and surroundings changed, but we also have the inward renewing of our heart and our spirit, and we receive the Spirit of God.
[172]  Ezekiel 36, however, does not tell us clearly and thoroughly how we may have a conversion, how we may have a new heart and a new spirit, and how we may obtain God s Spirit.
[173]  God s word in this chapter is not to make a sick person well and not to turn an evil person into a good person; God s word here is to cause a dead person to become a living person.
[174]  Praise the Lord that He did not leave us in our situation but came in to rescue us!
[175]  However, the Lord did not come in directly to be our Shepherd, but, in keeping with Ezekiel 37, He came in through the prophesying of His word.
[176]  If we apply this matter to our spiritual experience, we may say that when God blows upon us, that is the wind; when we breathe the wind, it is the breath; and when the breath comes into us, it is the Spirit.
[177]  Ezekiel 37:8 says, And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.
[178]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE NINETEEN THE VISION OF THE HOLY BUILDING OF GOD Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[179]  In the foregoing messages we saw the appearance of the glory of the Lord, the judgment of God by fire, and the recovery of the Lord by life.
[180]  Now we need to consider the place to see the vision.
[181]  Ezekiel did not see the vision concerning the building of God in the land of captivity.
[182]  When we come back to Christ, we may sense in our spirit that we are in an elevated place, that is, in the resurrected and ascended Christ.
[183]  Ezekiel 40:4 says, And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall show thee; for to the intent that I might show them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
[184]  While God was showing the vision of His building to Ezekiel, the prophet needed to have keen sight and to listen intently.
[185]  Praise the Lord that He is not only the wall but also the gate.
[186]  As the wall He excludes us and condemns us, but as the gate He brings us into God s building.
[187]  If we are in the sphere of God s building today, it is because Christ as the gate has brought us in.
[188]  After the gate comes the threshold, which measures six cubits by ten cubits.
[189]  By putting all these numbers together we can realize that Christ was the Triune God the number three who became a man having the number six.
[190]  This indicates that the Lord Jesus in His person and work is the real guard of God s glory and holiness.
[191]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TWENTY THE OUTER AND INNER COURTS Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[192]  The number thirty, used in relation to the chambers, is composed either of five times six or of three times ten.
[193]  If thirty is composed of five times six, we then have man six multiplied by responsibility five .
[194]  If thirty is composed of three times ten, then we have the Triune God in resurrection three fulfilling all the requirements ten .
[195]  From the outer court we need to pass into the inner court.
[196]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE THE ALTAR Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[197]  In this message we will go on from the inner gate and even from the inner court to consider the central matter the altar.
[198]  Before we do this, I would like to review two other matters so that we may be impressed with them.
[199]  We need to remember that six is the number of man, who was created on the sixth day, and that the number three signifies the Triune God in resurrection.
[200]  The fact that the gates are divided into three groups of two indicates that the Triune God became a man, the God-man, and was split, or cut, in His crucifixion, and is now in resurrection.
[201]  God came out of His dwelling place and went to the cross and died there in order to release what was in Him.
[202]  How can we prove from the record in the book of Ezekiel that God, man, and all the creatures died on the altar, on the cross?
[203]  How can we prove that the death of Christ was such an all-inclusive death?
[204]  How can we prove that the cross gives us God?
[205]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO THE TEMPLE AND SIDE CHAMBERS Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[206]  After we pass through the porch, we come to the outer temple.
[207]  Therefore, composed of eight times five, forty signifies the adding together of the man as God s creature and God in resurrection to produce something that has a perfect and complete form.
[208]  When we, the creatures who have received God s grace, are blended into one and are perfectly squared, becoming a unit of one hundred times four, God will have His abode among us.
[209]  The beauty of this temple is with the side chambers.
[210]  Although Christ and the church are the same in nature, the temple refers to Christ Himself, and the side chambers, as the fullness of the temple, signify the church as the fullness of Christ.
[211]  All these figures indicate that we can only enjoy as much Christ as we have experienced and that we can express only as much Christ as we have enjoyed.
[212]  When we, God-created men who have received God s grace, bear our responsibility and fulfill our function, then we will have the church as the fullness of Christ.
[213]  Now we come again to the latticed windows with the palm trees.
[214]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE BUILDING AT THE BACK, THE WALLS,
[215]  THE SIZE OF THE TEMPLE AND THE SEPARATE AREA IN FRONT OF IT AND BEHIND IT
[216]  Ezekiel 41:13-15 gives us the size of the temple and the separate area in front of it and behind it: So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long; also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.
[217]  And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court.
[218]  The thickness of the two sides of the wall is twelve cubits altogether, with each side six cubits v. 5 . The width of the side chambers is four cubits on each side, altogether eight cubits v. 5 . The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers is five cubits on each side, altogether ten cubits v. 9 . The width of the space left along the side chambers is five cubits on both sides, altogether ten cubits v. 9 . When we add all these, we have sixty cubits.
[219]  According to the record in Ezekiel, all the parts of the building related to the temple, including the temple proper, the porch, the side chambers, the building at the back, and all the walls, are covered, wainscoted, with wood 41:16 .
[220]  Thus, when we enter into the temple, we can see nothing but wood.
[221]  We offer something of Christ to God on this altar, and God prepares something of Christ for us on this table.
[222]  This indicates that if we are those who manifest the glory and victory of Christ, we will have the altar-table for God and us to have fellowship together in Christ.
[223]  The holy chambers are connecting buildings which connect the inner court with the outer court.
[224]  Those who enjoy Christ, store Christ, put on Christ, live by Christ, and serve God because of Christ will mature and reach a level of spiritual experience where they live a life full of fellowship and of mutual testimony, confirmation, and openness.
[225]  At the end, toward the rear, there are the boiling places, two places for the priests to boil their offerings and to bake the meal offerings 46:19-20 .
[226]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR THE RETURN OF GOD S GLORY TO THE HOUSE Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[227]  After the completion of the building of the house, the glory of the Lord returned.
[228]  Verse 2a says, And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east.
[229]  In verse 7b the Lord told Ezekiel that the people had offended Him by their whoredom and by their carcasses.
[230]  Here the Lord did not rebuke the house of Israel for their behavior and conduct, but for their whoredom and carcasses.
[231]  This is why the Lord says that the threshold of the carcasses was close to His threshold and that the post of their grave was close to His post in the temple v. 8 . On one side was the Lord s sanctuary; on the other side was the grave of the bodies of the kings.
[232]  After pointing out these abominations, the Lord told Ezekiel how to instruct the people: Thou son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities v. 10a . The Lord did not charge Ezekiel to teach God s people the law and the Ten Commandments as He had charged Moses.
[233]  THE ALTAR THE PLACE FOR GOD S PEOPLE TO BE REDEEMED AND CONSECRATED
[234]  In 43:18-27 we have the ordinances of the altar.
[235]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE THE PRIESTS AND THE OFFERINGS Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[236]  In the last message we saw that God cares for His house and that His desire is toward His house.
[237]  This means that everything we do needs to be according to the church, which is God s house.
[238]  In this message we will cover two major points: first, the kind of person who is qualified to serve in the house of the Lord and how such a person can serve the Lord; second, the offerings made to the Lord.
[239]  Then said the Lord unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord the God of Israel hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.
[240]  This word about the east gate indicates that Christ and God have an equal position, for after God had entered in by this gate, the only other person who can do so is Christ.
[241]  At this juncture we need to consider how the circumcised, faithful, and qualified ones serve the Lord.
[242]  First, they serve by offering the fat and the blood of the offerings v. 15 . The most precious part of the offerings is the fat, which typifies the precious person of the Lord Jesus.
[243]  In our service to God, we must present to Him the precious person of Christ and the redemptive work of Christ.
[244]  When the priests came in to minister to the Lord, they were not allowed to wear any woolen garment v. 17 . Instead, while they were in the Lord s presence serving Him, they had to wear linen garments.
[245]  When we use our own strength to endeavor and struggle, this proves that we are not under the Lord s blessing but rather are under the Lord s curse.
[246]  Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court Ezek.
[247]  Here we are told that the priests who minister directly to the Lord in the inner court were not permitted to drink wine.
[248]  In the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering Ezek.
[249]  Whenever we approach God, we need to offer the sin offering, even if we are not conscious of any uncleanness.
[250]  Every time we draw near to God, we need to apply the Lord s redemption and receive the cleansing of His precious blood.
[251]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE RIVER FLOWING FROM THE HOUSE Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[252]  47:1-12; Psa 36:8; 46:4; Joel 3:18b; Zech 14:8a
[253]  The first river, in chapter one, is the river Chebar, which was in the place where the people of God were held in captivity.
[254]  The tree of life indicates that God wants us to eat Him, and the river indicates that God wants us to drink Him.
[255]  The tree and the river in Genesis 2 are the beginning of two lines one concerning God as living food and another concerning God as living water that run throughout the Bible until they consummate with the tree of life and with the river of water of life in Revelation 22.
[256]  In John 6 the Lord Jesus spoke clearly about this: I am the bread of life v. 48 ; I am the living bread which came down out of heaven v. 51 ; My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink v. 55 ; he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me v. 57 . Regarding God as water for man to drink, the Bible speaks of the spring Exo 15:27 , the water out of the rock 17:6; Num 20:11; 1 Cor 10:4 , the water from the well Num 21:16-17 , and water from the ground Judg.
[257]  Ezekiel 47:1a says, Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward.
[258]  The man came with a measuring reed in his hand to measure the flowing of the river 47:3-5 .
[259]  Then he measured a thousand cubits, and the flow became deeper, up to the ankles v. 3 . Again he measured a thousand cubits, and the flow became deeper, up to the knees v. 4 . After this the man measured yet another thousand cubits, and the flow became even deeper, up to the loins v. 4 . When he for the fourth time measured a thousand cubits, the flow became a river which could not be passed over, and the river became waters to swim in.
[260]  It is easy to walk on dry land, but the flow of the river makes it difficult to walk.
[261]  When the water is up to the ankles, we can still walk, but it is not very convenient.
[262]  This indicates that before we enjoy the grace of the Lord as the flow, we are able to do whatever we like.
[263]  When we experience the Lord s flow only in a shallow way, we can still walk by our own effort.
[264]  Ezekiel 47:8 says that the river flows toward the East Sea.
[265]  LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN THE HOLY LAND AND THE HOLY CITY Scripture Reading: Ezek.
[266]  45:1-8; 47:13-20; 48:8-20, 31-35; Rev 21:12-13
[267]  The land, with all its riches, is called a land flowing with milk and honey 20:6 .
[268]  Ezekiel tells us that the whole land of Canaan was divided into three portions.
[269]  23-28 , and the middle portion, the holy portion, was an offering to God.
[270]  Both Ezekiel and Revelation end with a city, Jerusalem.
[271]  Only one city in the Bible has twelve gates with the twelve names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is the city of Jerusalem.
