<h2 class="head1">CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS</h2><p>We will select a few more passages to see how Christ accomplished redemption for us.</p><p>Romans 5:6-8: "For while we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will anyone die, though perhaps for the good man someone would even dare to die. But God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."</p><p>Romans 5:9-10: "Much more then, having now been justified in His blood, we will be saved through Him from the wrath. For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled." This shows us clearly that the death of Christ was not the death of a martyr. He did not die for a belief or a cause. He died for sin, in order for a way to be opened for sinners to be declared guiltless! Hence, 1 Corinthians 15:3 says that Christ "died for our sins."</p><p>Hebrews 9:22b: "Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness." Sin can only be forgiven after judgment.</p><p>First Peter 2:24: "Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose bruise you were healed." Then 3:18: "For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the spirit."</p><p>First John 1:7: "But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin."</p><h2 class="head1">ALL THE SINS ARE UPON JESUS</h2><p>Isaiah 53:6: "We all like sheep have gone astray; / Each of us has turned to his own way, / And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him." The words "fall on" here can also be translated as "placed upon." All of our sins have been placed upon Jesus. A brother who is an accountant said once that this is like transferring an account. Originally, sin was in your account. Now it has been transferred to the account of Jesus Christ.</p><p>One time a person asked a Christian about the way of forgiveness. The Christian showed him this passage in Isaiah and told him that if he would get in through the first "all" and come out through the second "all," he would be saved. We all are like sheep gone astray. Yes, I am included. I am a sinner that has gone astray. The Lord has caused the iniquity of us all to be placed upon Him. Yes, all my iniquities are upon Him.</p><p>There is a hymn which well describes the joy of this salvation:</p><p class="hbody">Why should I worry, doubt and fear?<br />Has God not caused His Son to bear<br />My sins upon the tree?<br />The debt that Christ for me has paid,<br />Would God another mind have made<br />To claim again from me?</p><p class="hbody">Redemption full the Lord has made,<br />And all my debts has fully paid,<br />From law to set me free.<br />I fear not for the wrath of God,<br />For I've been sprinkled with His blood,<br />It wholly covers me.</p><p class="hbody">For me forgiveness He has gained,<br />And full acquittal was obtained,<br />All debts of sin are paid;<br />God would not have His claim on two,<br />First on His Son, my Surety true,<br />And then upon me laid.</p><p class="hbody">So now I have full peace and rest,<br />My Savior Christ hath done the best<br />And set me wholly free;<br />By His all-efficacious blood<br />I ne'er could be condemned by God,<br />For He has died for me!</p><p class="hbody">Hymns, #1003</p>
