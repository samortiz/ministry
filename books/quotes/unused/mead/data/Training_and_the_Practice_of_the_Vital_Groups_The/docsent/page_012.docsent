   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I. THE CAUSE A. The Compassions of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The cause to be vitalized is the compassions of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This phrase the compassions of God is used in Romans 12:1 by the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He said, "I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God...."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Mercy is not as deep or as tender as compassions, so the word compassions picked up by the apostle is quite significant.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is something deeper in God's heart and something deeper that touches our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul used this word to refer to what he had written in the foregoing eleven chapters of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In those chapters, we are unveiled concerning God's choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God chose us in eternity past, and based upon this He called us in time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then He justified us through the redemption of Christ and the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were enemies of God, but He reconciled us to Himself and saved us through the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were regenerated to be God's children and as God's children, we enjoy His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this life we have been saved, we are being saved, and we are to be saved to the extent that we can even reign as kings in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What compassions these are!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I consider these items of God's compassions I am fully inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. The Degradation of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church includes every member of the Body of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church, in general, has left her best love for the Lord. b.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Having Married Herself to the World and Become Satanic, Full of the Hierarchical Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The degraded church has also married herself to the world, and the world is the satanic system of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Based upon this, the church spontaneously becomes satanic Rev 2:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The degraded church is also full of hierarchical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These teachings relate to a religious organization with positions and ranks.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such teachings annul the functions of the members of Christ and do not allow Christ to function as the Head of the Body.</S>
