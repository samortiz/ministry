He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him&#148; (John 5:23). Here the Lord shows us that He enjoys the same honor with the Father because He is the Father, and He is also God.</p><p>Jesus said to the blind man whom He had healed, &#147;Do you believe in the Son of God? He answered and said, And who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him? Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and He is the One who is speaking with you. And he declared, Lord, I believe&#148; (John 9:35-38). Here the Lord Himself told the blind man whom He had healed that He is the Son of God. This is the Lord&#8217;s own word saying that He is the Son of God, has the Godhead, and is equal with God.</p><p>In such verses as John 10:30, 17:11 and 22, the Lord Jesus clearly says that He and the Father are one. Just as the Father is God, He also is God. In addition, John 13:3 says, &#147;Jesus, knowing...that He had come forth from God, and was going to God.&#148; This word proves that the Lord and God are one. He had &#147;come forth from God&#148; and &#147;was going to God,&#148; (not to where God is) because He is God.</p><p>Then, again, the Lord said to His disciples, &#147;If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also....He who has seen Me has seen the Father....I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me&#148; (John 14:7-10). If men have seen Him, they have seen the Father; if they have known Him, they have known the Father. He is in the Father, and the Father is in Him, because He and the Father are one; He is the Father, and He is also God.</p><p>The Lord Jesus also said, &#147;All that the Father has is Mine&#148; (John 16:15). This means that all that God is rests in the Lord, as Paul also testified in Colossians 2:9: &#147;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&#148; for He is God as well as the Father.</p><p>The Lord&#8217;s prayer to the Father on the last night of His stay on earth was, &#147;And now, glorify Me with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was&#148; (John 17:5). In this word He told us that He shared the glory with the Father even before the world was. This proves that He is the same as God in the beginning because He is the God who is in eternity.</p><p>The disciple, Thomas, said to the Lord after His resurrection, &#147;My Lord and my God!&#148; (John 20:28). And in the following verse, the Lord confirmed Thomas&#8217; word, for He actually is both Lord and God.</p><p>In stating, &#147;But these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God&#148; (John 20:31), John declares that his entire Gospel was written in order to prove that the Lord is the Son of God-He is the same as God, having God&#8217;s nature and Godhead.</p><p>The book of Acts also says the Lord is Lord (2:36; 9:5; 10:36) as well as the Son of God (9:20; 13:33). This proves that the Lord has God&#8217;s divine nature and the Godhead and is the same as God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
