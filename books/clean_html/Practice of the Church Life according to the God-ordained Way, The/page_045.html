<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Exercising Your Mouth (Your Tongue)<br>and Your Voice (Your Sound)</H2><P>At this point I would like to say a further word concerning the exercising of our voice. Our speaking should not have a weak beginning; rather, it should have a strong start. If we begin our speaking in a weak voice, that will be a poor start. We must learn to exercise our voice to begin our speaking. To begin our speaking, our voice should be loud and our speaking should be somewhat slow. Otherwise, we will be merely shouting. The beginning of our speaking must be very sweet and very pleasant.</P><P>Some saints like to begin their speaking by saying "amen" loudly. This should be avoided. It is unpleasant to the hearers' ears because it is meaningless. It is not easy to begin our speaking in a proper way. After we get our spirit exercised and prepare our mouth with our tongue, we must utter something. The utterance, or the uttering, is the practice of our speaking. In our utterance we need to begin with a good voice.</P><P>In giving a message, the most difficult thing is not only to find a subject but also to find the proper way to begin the speaking. If a speaker begins wrongly, that wrong start will lead him astray in the entire message. This is similar to driving a car. To begin our driving, we must be careful to get on the correct freeway. If we get on the wrong freeway, we will be in trouble because it is difficult to turn around on a freeway. If a speaker has a good beginning, his entire message will be victorious.</P><P>Even in our prayer, the first sentence is crucial. In the 1991 Thanksgiving Conference in Reston, Virginia, before the beginning of the fourth meeting, I had a burden to pray. I talked with the Lord concerning how I should open my prayer and how my prayer should be carried out. Before the message, I offered a very living, prevailing prayer. My opening sentence was, "Lord, this morning we ask You to give us a trance that transfers us from the visible circumstances into the invisible scene." After concluding my prayer, I opened my message with a word concerning our need to be in a divine trance (Acts 10:9-10) in order to see the intrinsic view of the Body of Christ (see The Intrinsic View of the Body of Christ, chapter four, published by Living Stream Ministry). In a trance we see something not in an ordinary way but in an extraordinary way, not in the physical universe created by God but in the invisible scene behind the visible scene. This illustrates how we all need to learn how to begin our speaking and our prayer.</P><P>In Chefoo, in Shanghai, in Taiwan, and here in Anaheim, a number of times the atmosphere in the prayer meeting was low. Then I prayed just a short prayer, and immediately the meeting was uplifted. Sometimes the prayer meeting becomes dead. In such a situation, we need to learn to pray in a way that raises the dead meeting from the dead atmosphere and brings the meeting into resurrection.</P><P>We must learn to begin our speaking and prayer with a strong voice and a proper thought. In the Lord's table meeting some of the saints may offer praises to the Lord six or seven times. To praise the Lord six or seven times at the Lord's table is not too much, but it all depends on how we exercise. When we pray a number of times in the Lord's table meeting, we need to consider how we will begin and how we will carry out our prayer. Otherwise, many times our praising will become a burden on the meeting. What is important is not the number of times we pray. What matters is our skill, our way, in praying. Thus, we all need much exercise.</P><P>God's salvation is not simple. When I was young, I thought that everything concerning God was simple. Now, the longer I go on with Him, the more I realize that God is not simple. In the old creation God did not do anything; He just spoke, "Let there be light," and there was light (Gen. 1:3). He spoke and it was done (Psa. 33:9). But in His salvation, God abandoned that way. In relation to God's salvation, we may prefer God's way in the old creation, because it is so simple. We may think that because God is almighty, He can simply say, "Let the whole world be saved," and it will be so. In 1 Timothy 2:3-4 Paul said that "God..desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth." At times I have thought, "God, if this is Your desire, You just say it, and it will be. If You say, `Let all men be saved,' all men will be saved. If You say, `Let all men come to the full knowledge of the truth,' it will happen. We do not need to labor to bring people to salvation, or to set up a training or a meeting to teach people the truth." However, in the new creation it is not so simple.</P>
