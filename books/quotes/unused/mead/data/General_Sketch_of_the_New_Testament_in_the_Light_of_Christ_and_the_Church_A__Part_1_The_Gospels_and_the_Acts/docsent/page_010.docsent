   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Redemption and Life-imparting</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord's death and resurrection are a matter not only of Christ imparting Himself to us but also of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By His death Christ redeemed and recovered us, bringing us back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, redemption is not all; redemption is for imparting life, just as cleaning a cup is for the purpose of filling it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to use a cup in the way we intend, we must clean it; then after cleaning it, we can fill it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ's work is in this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After He redeemed us, He fills us with Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this way, redemption and life-imparting always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 19:34 says, "One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Two things flowed out of the Lord's side: blood and water.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The blood is mentioned first and then the water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The blood is for redeeming and cleansing, and the water signifies the imparting, the life-giving, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this verse, redemption comes first and life-imparting is second, just as we must clean a cup before we can fill it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because John 19 shows us the process of redemption and filling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Redemption, however, is supplementary to God's goal; it is not the original goal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the process, Christ needed to redeem us before He could fill us, but God's original goal is that man would be filled with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the Lord's table there are also two items: the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The bread is of fine flour from wheat, and the cup is of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The cup represents the redeeming blood of Christ, and the bread speaks of the imparting of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of these two items, the bread is the goal, and the cup is a supplementary item.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of the accomplishing of Christ's process, we can testify at the Lord's table that we are one with the Lord; this is signified by the bread, which comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our testimony is our oneness with Him, as seen in the bread, the loaf, the body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Following this, we declare to the universe that we, the fallen race, can be one with the Lord because of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As fallen, sinful, dirty, evil people, we can be one with the holy One by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The cup, therefore, is supplementary to the main item, the main testimony, which is the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we were sinful, dirty, and fallen, we are one with Him and one in Him because He has shed His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, at the Lord's table we first partake of the bread and then we share the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must always keep in mind that in the Lord's death and resurrection there is redemption and the impartation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In John 19 redemption is signified first, but this is not the most important thing; it is part of the process as an additional matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The foremost matter is the life-imparting aspect that enables us to be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The imparting of life always requires redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without Christ's redemption, it is impossible for Him to impart His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Similarly, without cleansing it is impossible for a cup to be filled up; the filling of a cup includes its cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the imparting, the life-giving, of Christ includes His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is by redemption and life-imparting that the created and fallen man is made one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Increase of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In John 3:29-30 John the Baptist said, "He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This joy of mine therefore is made full.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He must increase, but I must decrease."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The bride here is the increase of Christ just as Eve, the wife of Adam, was the increase of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Originally, God did not create a man and a woman at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God created only a single man, a bachelor.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, God said that it was not good for the man to be alone Gen 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Man needed an increase, a counterpart to match him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God took a rib out of Adam, and that part became Eve, his counterpart, his increase v. 22 . After that, if we were to look at Adam, we would see not Adam alone but Adam with a wife as his increase.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before His death and resurrection Christ was single; He was alone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In His resurrection He gained His increase as the bride to match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John 12:24 tells us that the one grain of wheat fell into the earth and died to produce many grains as the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Chapter fifteen of the same Gospel speaks of the many branches which are the increase of the vine vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In John 17 the Lord prayed that all of His believers might be one v. 21 . The many grains are crushed and ground into fine flour to be blended together as one loaf, one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that the oneness mentioned in the Lord's prayer in John 17 is for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the believers of Christ must be one, and this oneness is for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In addition, in 20:17 the Lord spoke of "My brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After His resurrection, He told Mary to go to His brothers, who are the reproduction, the duplication, of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The many brothers are blended and built together to become one Body signified by the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the duplication, the reproduction, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>MAN BROUGHT INTO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The last important point revealed in the four Gospels is that man is brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By His incarnation, God was brought into man; God was made one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now by Christ's redemption and life-imparting, man is made one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God is now one with man, and man is one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not only we are human but Christ also has the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is God in man and man in God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this way, God has accomplished His work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He brought God into man to make God one with man, and He also brought man into God to make this man one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now man and God, God and man, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, it is not easy to say where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>While we are on this earth, we are also in the heavenly places.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is why Colossians 3:3 tells us that our life has been hidden with Christ in God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are in the heavenlies because we are one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At the same time God is in us on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We may illustrate this with electric lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Without electricity the lamps are separated from the electric generator and from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the electricity, however, all the lamps are one with the generator, and the generator is one with the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>By Christ's incarnation God has been brought into man, and by His redemption and life-imparting, man has been brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Now God and man, man and God, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the meaning of our being in Christ and our abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These are truly high and wonderful matters.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must realize Christ's work to the extent that we are clear about these truths, which are mostly neglected by Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>May the Lord reveal these truths to us!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>May He remove the veils from our eyes and grant us this vision!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The above points are the depth of the meaning of the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>By His incarnation, Christ brought God into man, and with Him there was the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then, by His redemption and life-imparting, He brought man into God; He made us one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Now we are not merely men but God-men, men mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We are one with Him and one with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, He is the Head and we are the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Hence, we can now live a life exactly as He lived on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is the depth of the real meaning of the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we read the four Gospels from this point of view, we will be able to understand them more deeply.</S>
