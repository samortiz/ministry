[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Los Angeles, California in the Summer Training of 1965.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE SPIRIT, THE WORD, AND THE GIFTS TO CONVEY CHRIST TO THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Gal 1:15a, 16a; 1 Cor 1:24, 30; 2:2; 10:3-4; Matt 25:14-15; Rom 12:4-8; Eph 4:11, 16
[4]  According to the revelation of the Word, the Lord's central thought and intention is to have the church as His Body to express Himself.
[5]  Therefore, the church is for nothing other than Christ, and Christ is the very life, the very content, of the church.
[6]  THE MEANING OF THE GIFTS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[7]  The teachings are more or less ordinary, and certain kinds of gifts are very ordinary, but there are also certain extraordinary gifts.
[8]  If we read the book of Acts, we will realize that the miraculous things are for three purposes.
[9]  CHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMY OF GOD AND THE MARK OF GOD'S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:3-7; Gen 1:26-27; Isa 9:6; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 3:17; John 1:1, 14: 20:22
[10]  Second Corinthians 4:3 and 4 say, "And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those who are perishing, in whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine on them."
[11]  Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[12]  Regardless of how much education we have, what kind of position we have obtained, or how much wealth we have in our hands, without God we are still meaningless, because we were made purposely as containers to contain God.
[13]  GOD BEING TRIUNE FOR HIS ECONOMY TO WORK HIMSELF INTO US
[14]  THE MARK OF GOD'S ECONOMY CONCERNING THE PARTS OF MAN
[15]  CHAPTER THREE THE PARTS OF MAN AS THE VESSEL OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10; Psa 51:6; 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12; Luke 1:46-47; Phil 1:27; Mark 12:30
[16]  In this message we will continue to see the details of the parts of man as the vessel of the Lord.
[17]  We have seen clearly that God's intention is to work Himself into us to be our life and our everything.
[18]  THE SOUL HAVING THREE PARTS The Mind Being a Part of the Soul
[19]  With God there are three persons, with man there are three parts, and with the soul there are also three inward parts.
[20]  To speak of the intuition is a little more difficult, but we still have the scriptural ground.
[21]  CHAPTER FOUR THE HEART, THE SPIRIT, AND THE SOUL Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:16; Rom 10:9-10; Heb 10:22; Ezek.
[22]  36:26; Mark 12:30; Col 2:13; Eph 2:1, 5; John 3:6; 14:17; Ezek.
[23]  We have seen that the inward parts of our being are the parts of our soul, and the hidden part is our spirit Psa 51:6 .
[24]  I look to the Lord that we may have the grace to see all these things clearly, knowing all the parts of our being so that we may be able to exercise our spirit, heart, mind, and will to contact the Lord, to fellowship with the Lord, and to know the Lord.
[25]  Romans 10:9 and 10 say, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation."
[26]  First we have to turn our heart to the Lord, and second we must exercise our heart to believe in the Lord.
[27]  The Issue of Dealing with Our Heart Being That We Love the Lord More
[28]  When we received the Lord, our spirit was not only made alive but also was made new.
[29]  This other life and element is the divine, uncreated, eternal life of God, which is Christ Himself.
[30]  When the Holy Spirit comes into us, based upon the redeeming work of Christ, He not only makes our dead spirit alive but also brings Christ into our spirit as the new element, as another life added into our spirit.
[31]  The Function of the Spirit Being to Receive the Lord and Contact Him
[32]  The purpose of our spirit is to contact the Lord, to receive the Lord, to worship God, and to fellowship with the divine Person.
[33]  CHAPTER FIVE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND BEHAVIOR Scripture Reading: John 15:5
[34]  In this message we will consider the difference between the growth of life and the improvement of behavior.
[35]  Then in the following message we will consider the difference between the growth of life and the form of godliness, zeal in service, the increase of knowledge, the manifestations of gifts, and the increase of power.
[36]  If two brothers hate one another, someone may pray for them and advise them to love each other.
[37]  John 15:12 says, "This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you," and verse 17 says, "These things I command you that you may love one another."
[38]  THE NEED FOR A HEALTHY SPIRITUAL SENSE AND THE DEALING OF THE CROSS
[39]  How can we differentiate the love, humility, and patience that are out of ourselves from that which is the spreading of Christ?
[40]  CHAPTER SIX THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND THE FORM OF GODLINESS, ZEAL IN SERVICE, KNOWLEDGE, GIFTS, AND POWER Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:5; 1 Tim 3:16a; Acts 22:3; Rom 12:11; 1 Cor 8:1; 6:17; Num 22:28; 1 Cor 1:22-24; 3:1 THE OUTWARD FORM OF GODLINESS True Godliness Being the Likeness of God
[41]  Second Timothy 3:5 says, "Having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power; from these also turn away."
[42]  The Reality of Godliness Coming from the Increase of Christ within Us
[43]  The reality of godliness is the growth of life, and the growth of life is the increase of Christ within us.
[44]  Rather, it is to open ourselves again to the Lord, to contact Him daily and all the time, to be one spirit with the Lord, and to be filled, saturated, and permeated with Him and swallowed up by Him.
[45]  We must also see the difference between the growth of life and the increase of knowledge.
[46]  Today we need one thing: to open ourselves to the Lord, to contact Him, and to let Him come in to fill us, saturate us, and make His home in us that we may be filled not with the knowledge of God but unto all the fullness of God.
[47]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE INTRINSIC SIGNIFICANCE OF REGENERATION Scripture Reading: John 1:12-13; 3:6; Eph 2:5; John 3:14-16, 36; 5:24; 6:47; 1 John 5:11-12; 1 Pet 1:3; 2 Pet 1:3-4; Ezek.
[48]  36:25-27a; 1 Cor 2:12; Rom 8:9, 2; John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; Phil 1:19; Eph 1:13; 1 John 2:27; 2 Cor 13:5; Rom 8:10; Eph 4:6; 1 John 3:24; 4:12-13, 15; 2 Cor 5:17
[49]  REGENERATION BEING DISTINCT FROM THE BREATH OF LIFE IN GENESIS 2:7
[50]  The breath of life that God breathed into man in Genesis 2:7 was only a part of God's creation, for the purpose that man could live.
[51]  Regeneration is to be born of God, to receive God into us in Christ through the Spirit as the divine life, which is a life other than our natural life.
[52]  The Spirit whom we have received is also the anointing Spirit 1 John 2:27 .
[53]  We have seen what regeneration is and what we obtain by regeneration.
[54]  He did this by causing us to turn our mind to God, causing us to have an exercised conscience sprinkled with the cleansing blood, causing our emotion to delight in God and love God, and causing our will to be not only softened but also pliable and very submissive.
[55]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE CONDITION OF OUR SPIRIT WITH RESPECT TO REGENERATION Scripture Reading: Eph 2:1, 5; Col 2:13; John 3:6; Ezek.
[56]  Now we may see what the function of our regenerated spirit is.
[57]  To worship and contact God is a matter of the spirit.
[58]  First Peter 3:3 and 4 say, "Let your adorning not be the outward plaiting of hair and putting on of gold or clothing with garments, but the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is very costly in the sight of God."
[59]  The above seven items concerning the condition of the spirit are adequate to represent all the matters of the spirit: to worship God in the spirit, to serve God in the spirit, to pray in the spirit, to live and walk in the spirit, to know the things of God in the spirit, to work for God in the spirit, and to adorn ourselves in the spirit.
[60]  On the contrary, 1 Corinthians 2:14 tells us that the soulish man, the man of the soul and living in the soul, cannot understand the things of God and that the things of God are foolishness to him.
[61]  We have seen clearly what the condition and the function of the spirit are.
[62]  Now we must learn how to differentiate the spirit from the soul.
[63]  Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart."
[64]  DENYING THE SELF BY DENYING THE NATURAL MIND, EMOTION, AND WILL
[65]  How can we differentiate the spirit from the soul?
[66]  As Christians, the regenerated ones, whenever we are going to do something, we have to learn the lesson to deny the soul and the self.
[67]  When we go to do something for God, for a brother, or even for ourselves, as children of God, reborn persons, those who are learning to walk in the presence of the Lord and please the Lord, we have to learn the lesson to deny our self in whatever we do.
[68]  MEETING BY DENYING OUR SELF AND EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT
[69]  When we come to the Lord's table meeting, we should cross out what we know.
[70]  We should not pray according to what we know or what we like to pray.
