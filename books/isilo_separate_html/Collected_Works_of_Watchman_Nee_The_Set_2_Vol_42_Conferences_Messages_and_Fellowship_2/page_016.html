God's selection has to do with a nation, and eternal life has to do with individuals, but salvation has to do with the household.</p><h2 class="head1">ADAM HAVING LOST HIS HEADSHIP IN THE FAMILY</h2><p>The first household mentioned in the Bible is Noah's household. Although Adam had children, the Bible does not mention his household, because after Adam sinned in Genesis 3, he lost his position in his family. God had appointed Adam to be the head of his family, yet he lost his headship, and the first family was damaged. The brothers are the head of their households. It is not enough to be a husband and father; he has to be the head. In Genesis 3 Adam lost his place as a husband and a head. If there was a family there at all, it was Eve and her family, because Eve became the head there. Of course, this was not according to God's arrangement.</p><h2 class="head1">NOAH'S HOUSEHOLD</h2><p>Then God mentioned Noah's household. Those in his household were not particularly better than Adam. This family consisted of one pair on top and three pairs below. The Bible does not say much about Noah's wife and the three daughters-in-law. Of his three sons, however, one was good, one was partly good, and the third was bad. The question is not whether Noah's sons were good. The question is where Noah stood. With respect to the flood, God only dealt with Noah; He did not mention his wife, sons, or daughters-in-law. Noah represented his whole family. God said that Noah was just and perfect (Gen. 6:9) because he was able to assume the headship. When he was saved, his whole household was saved. The giving of eternal life is to individuals, but the unit of salvation is the household. If a family does not have a head, God deals with individuals. But when a family has a head, God deals with the head. If you are standing in the position of a head, God only needs to deal with you.</p><p>It is an interesting thing that God divides the world into families. Today man has damaged God's arrangement&mdash;the family has been damaged. What is the situation today? Families are filled with rebellion&mdash;sons rebel against the father's authority, the wife rebels against the husband's authority, and servants rebel against the master's authority. The family is broken and the oneness is gone. Once the head does not stand firm as the head, the institution of the family is destroyed. In order for a family to please the Lord, the head must stand firm in his position as the head. If a family does not have a head, God can only deal with each individual in the family. Noah's household was the first family that God dealt with as a whole.</p><p>God dealt with Noah's household in a different way than other households because Noah was able to assume the headship. What his wife and daughters-in-law did was an entirely different issue. Noah was able to assume the headship; he did not break down the institution of the family. I dare not say that the other seven had not sinned, but I can say that his family was not damaged. Everyone was under the authority of the head. This is why the whole household was saved even though God only called Noah. If we do not understand this, we cannot understand the meaning of Acts 16:31, which says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household." When we read this verse, individual faith and individual salvation come to our mind. Very often we change the unit and the numbers when our theology clashes with the Word of God. We consider something to be a heresy when it is actually God's Word. However, God's Word is very clear here. God grants salvation household by household. Of course, there must be a proper head to receive this salvation. Without a proper head, there cannot be household salvation. When a proper head is absent, the institution of the family is destroyed. If the wife, children, and daughters-in-law submit to the authority of the head of the house, the house will be saved.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
