<P>In dealing with humankind, God deals with only two races. These are the Adamic race, the race created by God, and the Abrahamic race, the race chosen by God. The first ten and a half chapters of Genesis are concerned with the Adamic race, the created race. This race failed God to the uttermost at Babel, where, in union with Satan to frustrate the divine economy, they rebelled against God, exalted themselves, and worshipped idols. Then God came in to select a person by the name of Abraham and decided to make his descendants a new race, the chosen race. The entire Bible from the second half of Genesis 11 to the end of the New Testament is occupied with this elect race.</P><P>With both the created race and the chosen race, God suffered a loss. The Adamic race failed Him, and the Abrahamic race also failed Him. As we read through the Old Testament to the end, we see that the children of Israel, the race of Abraham, utterly failed God. Nevertheless, the Old Testament ends not with disappointment but with expectation, for the godly ones among the chosen race were eagerly expecting the Messiah and were looking forward to receiving him. Thus, the Old Testament ends with the expectation that the Messiah, the unique one, would come.</P><P>Whereas the Old Testament ends with an expectation, the New Testament begins with a genealogy. Matthew 1:1 says, "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham." Verse 2 goes on to say that Abraham begot Isaac, that Isaac begot Jacob, and that Jacob begot Judah and his brothers. This genealogy continues until it arrives at a unique person: the One who in the Old Testament is called Messiah and in the New Testament is called Christ. Verse 17 concludes, "Thus all the generations...until the Christ." All the generations of the Abrahamic race were directed to Christ and brought in Christ. Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations; as such, He fulfills their prophecies, solves their problems, and meets their needs. When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him. From this point on, the whole New Testament is a full expounding of this wonderful Christ, who is everything to us. Hallelujah, Christ has come!</P><P>At the beginning of the New Testament, we have a new race with a new center, and this center is Christ. With Him we have the divine economy, the divine dispensing, and the unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8). When Christ comes, all manner of positive things come with Him. The list of these things is endless.</P><P>The list of what came with Christ even includes us who believe in Christ, for as believers we are descendants of Abraham. When God selected Abraham, He decided to give him two kinds of descendants&#151;the physical descendants and the spiritual descendants. Abraham's physical descendants are the physical Israel, and his spiritual descendants are the spiritual Israel. The New Testament deals mainly not with the physical Israel but with the spiritual Israel. In order that we may have full confidence concerning this, let us now consider some verses from the book of Galatians.</P><P>Galatians 3:8 says, "The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles out of faith, announced the gospel beforehand to Abraham: `In you shall all the nations be blessed.'" Here Paul does not say that God would justify the Jews; he says that God would justify the Gentiles. But then he tells us that the gospel was announced not to the Gentiles but to Abraham. God announced to Abraham the gospel concerning the Gentiles. This indicates that the Gentiles would be included among the spiritual descendants of Abraham.</P><P>Verse 9 continues, "So then they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham." Today we are of faith, and we are blessed with believing Abraham because we are his spiritual descendants.</P><P>In verses 13 and 14 Paul goes on to say, "Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, `Cursed is every one hanging on a tree'; in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith." What is the blessing that God promised to Abraham? It is the Spirit, the consummated Triune God. The consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit is the blessing of the gospel preached to us.</P>
