Joseph's life is an illustration of this verse and an example of how everything works for good for those who love God. The seed sown in the book of Genesis grows in Romans 8:28 and is harvested in Revelation 15, where we see the overcomers standing on the sea of glass, which signifies trials, tests, and sufferings. Joseph's brothers helped him come to the throne. If they had not sold him into slavery, he could not have come to Egypt. Hence, their selling of him ushered him to the throne. Do not complain about what your wife or husband or the saints in the church do to you. For those who love God, everything works together for good. The crucial matter here is whether or not we love God. If you love Him, even an accident works good for you. But if you do not love Him, not even graduating from a university with a doctorate will work good for you. I have suffered much throughout the years, but I have been comforted by the fact that everything works good for me. Whenever I undergo suffering, I remember Romans 8:28 and I am comforted immediately.</P><P>As a young man of seventeen years of age, Joseph needed to undergo trials and testings. Because Joseph was the favorite of his father Jacob, he lived in a pleasant environment, and there was no way for him to suffer anything. He was always under his father's protection. But one day, according to the Lord's sovereignty, Jacob sent Joseph to his brothers, and they sold him into slavery. Through the sufferings that came upon him as a result of this, Joseph was trained to be a ruler. In this matter we see God's wisdom.</P><P>Firstly, Joseph had the dreams in which he saw his brothers bowing down to him. But in order for this vision to be fulfilled, Joseph had to undergo a great deal of suffering, especially at the hands of those closest to him. Joseph suffered constantly from the time he was seventeen until he was thirty. Joseph needed to pass through all these sufferings so that he might be perfected and qualified. God had sent Joseph to Egypt to preserve life so that a remnant might remain for the fulfillment of His purpose.</P><P>Do not be frightened by this word regarding Joseph's sufferings. Perhaps you have asked the Lord to make you today's Joseph. The Lord will answer this prayer by causing you to undergo certain sufferings. During times of suffering you may say, "How long, O Lord? The dreams of others have been fulfilled, but where is the fulfillment of my dream?" Eventually, you will be released. Joseph was patient and denied himself. He did not do anything for his own enjoyment, but for the discipline and perfection of his brothers.</P><P>In order to strengthen his brothers, Joseph revealed to them his exaltation and glory, and he told them that God had made him a father to Pharaoh. In 45:13 he said, "And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt." Joseph's brothers considered him like Pharaoh. But Joseph seemed to say, "I'm the father of Pharaoh. I am even higher than you realize, for God has made me the father of Pharaoh. You have seen all my glory. Go back and tell my father all you have seen." Joseph was not being showy. Rather, he was strengthening his brothers so that they might bring their father to him.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_674.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_676.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 675</div><br></body></html>
