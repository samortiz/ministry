<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I left Yung-Jia on the twenty-fifth of last month and went with Brother Hwa Shi-bin and Brother Huang Li-chuan to Rue-An. I held a conference with Brother Hwa in the independent church in Rue-An. Then I went with Brothers Hwa and Huang to Ping-Yang to visit the brothers on the second of this month and held a conference for five days in Fang-Yen-Hsia. Today I came with Brother Hwa and Brother Chen Chin-fa to Hsiao-Nan County of Ping-Yang. We will work for two or three evenings in Mo-Cheng. The Lord willing, we will visit the brothers in Shan-Men of Bei-Jiang County. After returning from Shan-Men, Brother Hwa will probably return to Ning-Hai. I am still waiting for the Lord's leading. I have been traveling for a long time. I really need to be calm before God and give Him a chance to trim me.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Hsu Dah-weh<br />April 11</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chen Meng-tsao,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><p>I received the fifth issue of The Open Door. Thank God! He shows us more about the work and the travels of His servants so that we now have fresh burdens in our prayer and are more in one accord with all the saints. There were four days of meetings in Shui-Ting that began on March 27. God used Brother Ma (Chuan-fu) to do some work in saving people. Praise the Lord for saving several people. From the thirty-first of last month to the fourth of this month, He arranged a conference of four days and five nights for the entire church of God in Lan-Si in which He spoke concerning the differences and relationships between the church, the work, and the workers through the mouth of His servant, Brother Ma. He also handed over the charge of God's commission to His children. Praise and thank God. In the past we knew only that the brothers bore the responsibility for the practical matters. We now see that God wants to call them to bear the spiritual yoke as well as to build up the Body of Christ. What is lacking now is the gifts in Ephesians 4. May God give more of these kinds of gifts to His church. May He raise up more elders and deacons like those in Titus 1 to govern His house. I have recently received a clear charge from God to do some pioneering work in Si-Bei County of Lan-Yi. The people there live very close together, but the gospel is seldom preached. Brother Hu (Bu-dao) and I will go to Tieh-Lu-Tou and Huang-Ni-Shan to work for a time during the middle of this month. (The first place is about thirty-five miles from the city and about fifteen miles from the assembly in Ju-Ge. The second place is more than twenty miles from the city.) Then we will pioneer in Hou-Ren, Gan-Shi, and Nu-Bu, the Lord willing. Please remember this in your prayer.</p><p>The southwestern portion of Chekiang, including the two counties of Chang-Shan and Sui-An, have cried for Brother Ma to go and work there. The brothers in Wu-Yi want Brother Ma to go and help with the work among the young people. Those are probably the two places he will go to in the next two months. There was a baptism in the church in Lan-Si on the thirty-first of last month. Fifteen brothers and eleven sisters were baptized. May they have a good testimony from now on. The brothers and sisters who came to Lan-Si to escape the war have gradually passed safely over the border. The family of Shen Guan-min from Soochow is the only one that is still staying in Shui-Ting Village in Lan-Si.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Meng-tsao<br />April 9<br />[Address omitted]</p>
