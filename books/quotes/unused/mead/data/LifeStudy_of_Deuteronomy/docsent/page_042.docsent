   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jehovah Dispossessing</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All Those Nations from before Them,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and They Possessing the Land of the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 22 Moses spoke of four things: keeping the commandments which Moses commanded, loving Jehovah, walking in all His ways, and holding fast to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today we should keep Christ, love God, walk in His ways, and hold fast to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to love the Lord Jesus to such an extent that we will hold fast to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moses went on to say that if the people keep the commandments, love God, walk in His ways, and hold fast to Him, "Jehovah will dispossess all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier than you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every place on which the sole of your foot treads will be yours; from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the River Euphrates, even unto the farmost sea will be your border" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Hebrew name for the Euphrates is Parath.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The "farmost sea" is the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to verse 24, the good land should extend from the Mediterranean Sea to today's Iraq.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us now review the blessings in 11:8-25.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These blessings include being strengthened and encouraged to possess the promised land, extending our days in the land under God's care and in His presence, receiving the heavenly watering, loving the Lord, and holding fast to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is surely a blessing to hold fast to the Lord and to walk in His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The greatest of these blessings is the blessing of God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>P. Moses Setting a Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>and a Curse before the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>and Charging Them to Put</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>the Blessing upon Mount Gerizim</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>and the Curse upon Mount Ebal</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verses 26 through 28 Moses said, "See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse: the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I am commanding you today; and the curse, if you do not listen to the commandments of Jehovah your God and you turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today, to go after other gods whom you have not known."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether we have the blessing or the curse depends on whether or not we take Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we take Christ, we have the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not take Christ, we have the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 29 Moses continued, "When Jehovah your God brings you into the land which you are entering to possess, you shall put the blessing upon Mount Gerizim and the curse upon Mount Ebal."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether we receive the blessing or the curse depends on how we behave ourselves toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have Christ, we will receive the blessing and be on Mount Gerizim.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not have Christ, we will receive the curse and be on Mount Ebal.</S>
