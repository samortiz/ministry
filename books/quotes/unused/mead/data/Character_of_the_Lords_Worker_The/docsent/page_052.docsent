   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The effectiveness of a minister has much to do with the stability of his character.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is a basic requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a man is shaky before God, he cannot be a minister, and the church cannot follow him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A fundamental problem with some brothers and sisters is the lack of a stable character.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are constantly changing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They sway back and forth and are never steady and firm before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They cannot serve the church, because they cannot stand firm and upright, and the gates of Hades easily prevail over them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thank the Lord that Peter was chosen as a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is looking for a man whose nature is the same as the nature of the foundation under him and the superstructure of the building around him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A minister must be a stable stone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thank God that Peter was chosen as a pattern, because his case shows us that God can make anyone stable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here was a man named Peter, yet he was not always a "Peter."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His name referred to a stone, but his character was like water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was one thing at one time and another thing another time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One minute Peter was bold and the next minute he was very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was the kind of person he was.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord put such a person before us to show us how unstable a person's nature can be before he is dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before such a person becomes a stone, he cannot use the keys and cannot be useful to God in any particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God can only use him after his wobbly nature has been dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We thank the Lord that a man's character can change; it is not unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter was a wavering person, yet he could be changed into a stable person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the light of the Lord burns our tongue, our talkativeness will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a lazy man is rebuked, his laziness wilts away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord cursed the fig tree, and the tree dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's rebuke brings in His curse, and where His curse is, there is wilting and death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we have never touched Him, we can go on in our merry way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But as soon as we touch Him, our frivolity wilts away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As soon as God's light touches us, either through a message or through a brother's direct rebuke, something in us wilts away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord's rebuke results in an immediate wilting away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here we are talking about a reconstitution or a remake of our character.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many people have a character that cannot listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Or they may have a character that is too cold, lazy, or weak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But as soon as God touches them, or a brother comes along and points out their insensitivity in listening or their weakness, they will receive the light, and something in them will wilt away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is God's grace that Peter was chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Had it not been for Peter, all those who are weak and unstable would have no hope.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Lord chose one man and called him Peter, and after He made him a "Peter," He gave him the keys to bring men into the church.</S>
