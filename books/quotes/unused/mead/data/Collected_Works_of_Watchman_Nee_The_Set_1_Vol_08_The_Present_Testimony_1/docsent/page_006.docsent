   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's goal is that we be filled with His will to such an extent that we forget our own interest.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God wants us to work together with Him to accomplish His will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The way to work together with Him is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason He wants us to abide in Him to learn His will in various matters and then ask according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genuine prayer is a real work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prayers that are according to God's will and which ask for God's will to be done are a work of dying to the self.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must be weaned from the self completely, that is, we must not have a bit of self-interest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must live completely to God and only seek after His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we will like what He likes, pursue what He pursues, and pray what He wants us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Indeed, it is difficult enough not to have any self-interest in working for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is even more difficult not to have any self-interest in praying for God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One who would live completely to God must be so.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past generations, God could have done many things and, in fact, would have liked to have done many things, but because His children did not work together with Him, He did not perform them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was not God who failed, but His people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we review our entire personal life, we will see the same story.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Had we only had greater faith and more prayer, our life would not have been so.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today God is seeking that His children would be willing to be one with His will and through prayer proclaim this kind of union.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No believer has ever fully experienced the greatness of being completely one with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once a servant of the Lord said well that "prayer is the railroad track of God's work."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What tracks are to a train, prayer is to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A locomotive does have great power and ability; it is able to run thousands of miles in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if there are no tracks, the locomotive will not be able to move one inch.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If it tries to move one inch, it will sink into the mud.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It can go everywhere except where no tracks have been laid by man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the relationship between prayer and God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not need to explain in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The meaning of the illustration should be obvious to all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Indeed, God is almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one can oppose His work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if you and I do not work together with Him in prayer or prepare the way for His will through prayer or by means of all prayer allow Him the possibility to move in many directions, He will not work and cannot work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today locomotives cannot pass through many places in interior China.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not because their engines have no power, but because there are no tracks on which to run.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God wills and wants and even delights to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But because His children do not express their sympathy with Him or pray to open the way for Him, He is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of us who are fully consecrated to God should consider if we are daily limiting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, our most important work is to open the way for God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no other work more important than this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With God there are many possibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if we do not open the way for Him, all will become impossibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore our prayers in one accord with God should increase more than ever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us pray thoroughly let us pray on all sides so that God's will will reach all directions.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No doubt our activities among men are important.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But before God, working together with Him by prayer is even more important.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To pray does not mean to change the mind of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the greatest mistake to think that God is hard and stubborn and that we must use prayer to battle with Him until He yields to us and changes what He has predetermined.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Actually, any prayer that is not according to God's will is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because God's will has suffered a hindrance from either men or demons, we come before God as if we are wrestling with Him , asking that He execute His will and that His predetermined will not suffer through hindrances to His "permitted will."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we really desire God's predetermined will and if we have such prayer, such wrestling with God, and such resisting of any hindrance to His will, it will cause Him to carry out His predetermined will, not allowing anything of men or demons to temporarily come in the way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is true that it appears that we are wrestling with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually, this is for the accomplishment of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not that we have a certain idea and are trying to change His will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For this reason, unless we really know what God's will is, we shall not be able to work together with God in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Dear brothers, once we know the true meaning of prayer, we have to be careful not to allow the flesh to speak anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>O dear ones, if God will send laborers by Himself, the Lord would not have told us to ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If His name will automatically be hallowed, if His kingdom will come without our cooperation, and if He will cause His will to be carried out on earth by Himself, He would not have taught us to pray this way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If He will come again without the need for the sympathy of the church, His Spirit would not have inspired the apostle to ask Him to come quickly again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If God the Father will automatically cause His believers to be one, there would not have been the need for the Lord to pray such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the cooperation of God and man is not important, what is the point of Christ interceding in heaven continuously today?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>O dear ones, praying in sympathy with God is more important than doing anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He can only work on matters in which His children sympathize with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is not willing to work where there has been no prayer, where He does not have His people's will in union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This union of the wills is real prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Obtaining an answer to prayer is not the highest goal of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The purpose of prayer is that we be one with God's will so that God can work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When our will is one with God, even though we may at times ask amiss and our prayer is not answered, God still receives the benefit because He is able to work as a result of our sympathy with Him.</S>
