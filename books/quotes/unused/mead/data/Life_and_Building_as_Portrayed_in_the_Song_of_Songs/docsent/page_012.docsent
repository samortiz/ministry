   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CONTROVERSY BETWEEN TWO PERSONALITIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do you see the discrepancy between the Lord and the seeking one?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She intends to have rest and stay at home, but the Lord intends that she rise up and go away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The controversy between the two parties is caused by two different personalities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She is a person, and He is also a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet, He is a stronger Person, and He asks her to rise up and come away.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then she answers, "My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether" 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord calls her to come away, but she does not care for His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She says, "My beloved is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is for me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I just enjoy Him."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He asks her to rise up, but she says that He is for her enjoyment and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is the shepherd among the lilies, and she is one of the little lilies under His shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She does not care at all for the Lord's call.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She only cares for her enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She realizes that she is the Lord's, so she says that He is hers and she is His.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She was enjoying the Lord's shepherding, the Lord's satisfaction, and the Lord's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The picture portrays that she cares only for her own satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She does not care for the Lord's will, intention, or goal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But that is not all she says to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She also says, "Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that she is not ready or willing to go out with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So she tells the Lord to wait until the shadows flee away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She realizes some kind of shadow, some kind of darkness is between her and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So she tells the Lord to wait for some time, and then to turn back at the mountains of Bether.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word "Bether" means separation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then, in the following chapter the Lord disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go " 3:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The seeking one seeks the Lord, but she cannot find Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Finally, she is forced to rise up and go after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even though she says that she is not ready, and that the Lord must wait until the shadows flee away, the Lord will not go along with her.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>So He disappears, forcing her to fulfill His call to rise up and go away from her home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She goes into the street and does her best to find her beloved, but she cannot find Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then suddenly, the Lord is there again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>BEING SUBDUED</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do you see the picture?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is right that we should love the Lord, but we should not do it according to our way and our intention.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our will must be subdued to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Simply to love Him is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Loving Him will cause many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore we need the subduing of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Person whom we love is the strongest One.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He will never be subdued, and He can never be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we are the ones who must be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord did not appear to her according to her way or her intention.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was when she was disappointed that He suddenly appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But when she found the Lord, she held Him and would not let Him go.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This shows her strong character.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She was still so strong to hold the Lord according to her way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This whole picture shows us one who has never been subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Yes, we love the Lord, yet we have never been subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To love the Lord is wonderful, but it also causes problems.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The problems are solved only by our being subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must be subdued and conformed to His personality, His will, His intention, and His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Otherwise, we will constantly have a controversy with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The main problem with husbands and wives in their marriage life is the controversy between them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The wives love their husbands, but they love them according to their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The husbands have their way, and the wives have theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The wives' will would never be subdued to the husbands' will; so there are problems.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is why in a wedding the bride always has her head covered to show that she must be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is no other way for us to take Christ as life except by loving Him as a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>And if we would love Him as a Person, we must be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the unique problem between Him and us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There is hardly another problem.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The problem is that we are not willing to be subdued, and the Lord Jesus will never be subdued by us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is humble, kind, and tender, but He will never be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is the Lord; He is the King; He is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is why I say that all of these exciting verses eventually reveal something that is quite disappointing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Here is a person who loves the Lord, yet a controversy exists between her and the One she loves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do you think that holding the Lord in such a strong way is good or bad?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the one hand it is good, because she is holding the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But on the other hand, it is not so good, because she is too strong!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord would say, "Please give Me the liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Release Me. Don't hold Me so strongly." But because of her strong personality, she holds the Lord very strongly and tells Him that she will never let Him go.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>LESSONS IN THE SONG OF SONGS</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We love the Lord, but we have a stubborn will and a strong character, which are a real problem to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We seek the Lord, but we seek Him for our own will and for our own good.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is why in the Song of Songs the Lord must teach His seeking one some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we read this book carefully, we will see that at the end of the book she is so soft and submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Her character and personality are hardly noticeable.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>What she has is the Lord's character and the Lord's personality.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Now she is really one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There are two persons, but only one personality.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>After we are attracted by the Lord's beauty to love Him, we must learn one unique lesson to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To take Christ, the living Person, as our life requires us to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Simply to love Jesus is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Lord's intention is that we take Him and experience Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There is no other way except to love Him and be subdued by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then we will be one with Him, having one personality.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We will be so soft and submissive to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In this picture, the lover of Jesus is exceedingly strong at the beginning, with such a stubborn character.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Yet at the end, she is so soft and submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is the lesson that we all must learn in order to really experience Christ as our life.</S>
