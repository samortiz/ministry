   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE RECOVERY OF THE BODY-CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our God today is no longer the raw God but the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He has been processed through five stages: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and entering into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God has been processed to enter into you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This process produces the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, our God today has become the Body-Christ, the incorporated God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not a human concept but the divine revelation in the Holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some may be bothered because they have never before heard the terms the incorporated God or the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These terms are new because the Lord has only recently recovered this item of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord began His recovery with Martin Luther by recovering the item of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since then four and a half centuries have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Within these past four and a half centuries all the denominations have found certain items of the Lord s recovery but have not progressed beyond them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lutheran Church has one item of the Lord s recovery justification by faith but they have remained there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, nothing can stop the Lord from advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He has gone on to recover many other items of truth since the sixteenth century, and today He is recovering even more items.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Recovery of Calling on the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I was born and raised in Christianity as a fourth-generation Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As I was growing up, I never heard of exercising the spirit or calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are many items in the Bible that Christians simply do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No matter how many times they read and study the Scriptures, they see only the letters on the page, not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 10:12 clearly says, The same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Countless Christians have read this verse, but no one saw the reality revealed in this verse until the Lord opened it to us in a meeting in Los Angeles in 1968.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may know doctrinally that Christ is unsearchably rich, but we need to see how we can receive the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The key and the way to enjoy the riches of Christ are revealed in Romans 10:12.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse does not say that the Lord is rich to all who believe in the Lord Jesus or who pray to Him but to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Greek word for call upon is epikaleo, which means to call out audibly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is a difference between calling upon the Lord and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praying may be compared to asking someone for something in a calm, polite manner.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if our house is on fire, we will not ask for help in a polite way but will call out for someone to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 10:6-8 says, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down; or, Who will descend into the abyss? that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But what does it say?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the word of the faith which we proclaim.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verses 6 and 7 mention Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 8 the word is used interchangeably with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here the Bible indicates that the word not the written, printed word, but the living Word is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Word that is the living Christ is in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the physical sense, that which is always near us and in our mouth is the air.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The air is near us and in our mouth day and night, while we are awake and while we are sleeping, while we are calm and while we are losing our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today our Christ is just as available as the air.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The living Word, which is Christ, is always available, but if we keep our mouth shut, we will not partake of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not breathe physically for only a few minutes, we will surely die.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all must breathe to live.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Likewise, in order to live and be healthy spiritually, we need to open our mouth to call, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sadly, many believers, even those who have theological degrees, are spiritually dead simply because they do not breathe by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be fair, most believers do occasionally call on the Lord, but they call only when they are in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In ordinary times they may prefer to discuss doctrines, but when they are in a difficult situation, they call, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not wait for an accident to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, if we do not willingly call on the Lord, He may arrange our circumstances to force us to call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all need the Lord Jesus; therefore, we need to call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may study food and even earn a degree in nutrition, but no matter how much we may know about food, there is no way for us to enjoy food other than by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all need to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Similarly, there is no better way for a person to participate in the riches of Christ than by calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Anywhere and any time that we call on the Lord, we are refreshed, strengthened, and filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we are filled with the Lord, we will be beside ourselves with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Any time we are in a difficult situation, if we would simply call on the Lord, there will be comfort in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we call on the Lord, we will receive the riches of Christ.</S>
