   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How to Meet</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The meetings of the believers are at times for prayer, at times for preaching, at times for the discussion of affairs, and at times for the breaking of bread to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For now we will only talk about the meetings for the breaking of bread and the worship of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A meeting should be gathered into the Lord's name Matt 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that we should have the Lord as the center, and we should come for Him and worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the meetings, we should pay special attention that we are coming to the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not come merely because a certain person is there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not come to listen to certain preachers, nor for thousands of other reasons; we come only to meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the meetings, there is no set schedule and no man-made chairmen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything should be done under the leading of the Holy Spirit 1 Cor 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 14:26 is most crucial: "Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse tells us that all believers, whether old or young, rich or poor, have the right to be led by the Holy Spirit to share in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 31 is even more clear: "For you can all prophesy one by one."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Corinthians met together, there was much conduct that was disorderly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the apostle did not consider such a way of meeting impermissible or that it should be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He merely told them that they should behave in an orderly way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, this order is not a man-made, dead schedule that is manipulated by man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, it is something according to the leading of the Holy Spirit and according to His orderly distribution.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we read this chapter alone, we find that in the meeting of God's children there are no formalities such as those found in present-day so-called services.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"The first should be silent" in verse 30 is one example of the lack of formality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 35 shows that if the brothers do not understand something in the meeting, they can ask at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Women should not speak in meetings with brothers present 11:5; 14:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the Bible, the breaking of bread for the remembrance of the Lord should be a breaking of bread by the disciples Acts 20:7, etc. . Hence, no one can represent the Lord to pass out the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There should be thanksgivings 1 Cor 14:16 , but no one is assigned to offer such thanksgivings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone should be led by the Holy Spirit, and everyone should break the bread himself, with one merely taking the lead as the first one to break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How to Administrate</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>and Shepherd the Church of God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In every meeting, the Lord raises up those who will work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They do not have the so-called "official" commissions from the denominations, but they have God's commissioning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible teaches that believers should subject themselves to such people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their work is based on their relationship with the other members and their gifts, not on any human assignment or titles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those brothers who have sinned should be admonished, warned, and eventually excommunicated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If they are to be excommunicated, they must have committed the sins in 1 Corinthians 5:11.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All God's children who desire fellowship should be received, no matter what level of knowledge they may have Rom 14:1; 15:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The anointing and praying for the sick James 5:14-15 and other similar works should be done for the sake of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How to Have Social Acquaintances</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Other than the mutual fellowship among the believers, the Bible does not say anything about the church's social contacts with the government, society, or any other communities.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such are considered the acts of an adulterous woman.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How to Collect Offerings and Distribute Funds</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Concerning the offerings by the saints of course, only offerings by the saints are acceptable , the Bible has clear instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is neither the teaching nor the example in the Bible of the offering plate or the offering pouch being passed around for soliciting offerings on Sunday.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even in the Old Testament, we do not see such a practice!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Old Testament, we see only a box set up at the entrance to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A worker can exhort the believers to give 2 Cor 8:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But there is no such thing as sending men out to remind people or even beg for money.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the contrary, what we see is "with much entreaty they besought of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints" v. 4 . The teaching in 1 Corinthians 16:1-2 points out to us the importance of offering on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such offerings are for "filling up the lack of the saints" 2 Cor 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In distributing the offerings, we must, of course, consider what the offerings are designated for.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the attitude of 2 Corinthians 8:12 is most necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These offerings are, of course, put into the hands of those who are approved 1 Cor 16:3 and "selected" 2 Cor 8:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who work for the Lord should be "taking nothing from the Gentiles" 3 John 7 , and God's children should fill up their lack 2 Cor 11:9; 1 Cor 9:11; Phil 4:15-16; 1 Tim 5:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How to Send Men to Preach</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>and How to Care for the Branch Mission Halls</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No matter how spiritual a person is, the Bible has not authorized anyone to send others out for the preaching work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such practice is a poison left from the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no such thing in the Bible as putting one servant of the Lord into the hand of another servant.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the servants are directly responsible to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even Paul could not force Barnabas to not take Mark along.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brothers can make suggestions, but there must not be any control.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even the aged Paul only "exhorted" Timothy, his own son, to remain in Ephesus 1 Tim 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We observe in the work of the apostles that there were friendly exhortations that had to do with the work, but no such thing as the present assignment of preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You may ask: if this is the case, will not men move arbitrarily and become lazy in their work?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yes, they will, and that is wherein lies the failure of the denominational systems.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is bound to happen among hired workers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we stop the practice of having salaried preachers, those denominations which have money which was unheard of at the apostolic times will no longer be able to control the servants of the Lord with their money, and they will only be able to hire shepherds who do not have any calling and who will take spiritual work as a kind of profession.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If such is the case, will not many preachers be disqualified from their work?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yes, if we indeed practice this, we will see how numerous are those who joined the rank of preachers at will, and how few are those who are truly called by God!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not volunteer to work ourselves; we should be those who are sent by God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Terms such as "branch mission halls" and "branch churches" are not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All the churches in the Bible are administered locally by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The practice of combining the different "churches" in the localities to form a head church is an invention of the denominational organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Things such as conventions, synods, head churches, districts, and precincts are all products of the human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The churches in the Bible are related to one another as members.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They can encourage, teach, and warn one another, but no one church controls the affairs of another church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is the practice of Roman Catholicism to try to unify church administration through joining different "churches" together.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Bible never considers the churches in Philippi and Ephesus to be under the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The basic unit of the Body of Christ is the individual believers, not the individual churches.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The individual churches are not the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We can lead others to Christ and teach others the way of the Lord, but we cannot have any human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If the Lord's precious blood is not enough to join us together, in the same way that the names of organizations are joining men together, does this not mean that the precious blood has become worthless to us?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The brothers and sisters in the Lord should continually help one another, but the denominational, organizational, and institutional practices must be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In short, if we want to follow the Bible, we need to trust in the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Otherwise, everything will be in confusion.</S>
