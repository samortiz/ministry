   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By Thy grace to be</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just a cleans d channel</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For Thy life through me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This also is a very good hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The expressions and wording are very poetic, and the feeling is very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everything about it belongs to a higher realm and is lofty and mature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is rare for a hymn on fellowship to reach such a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is not a tint of unnaturalness or extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a genuine expression of a genuine lover of the Lord toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is perfect submission borne out of perfect consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is the voice of submission that comes from the heart of one who has no resistance toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"If the path I travel/Lead me to the cross,/If the way Thou choosest/Lead to pain and loss,/Let the compensation /Daily, hourly, be/Shadowless communion,/Blessed Lord, with Thee."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is full of consecration and submission.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Stanza two is the best stanza in the whole hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here the feeling ascends still higher.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"If there's less of earth joy" the writer is contemplating "Give, Lord, more of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is praying to God, not for deliverance or for change, but for more fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Let the spirit praise Thee, /Though the heart be riven."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here is a person who can differentiate between the heart and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The heart may be broken, but the spirit can praise.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The heart may be riven, but the spirit is still fresh before God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He knows the difference between the heart and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He does not ask for enjoyment of the heart but for compensation of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He has begun the ascent, but the next line is still higher.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first line says, "If there's less of earth joy," while the fifth line says, "If sweet earthly ties, Lord,/Break..."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These two lines are linked by the word earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"If sweet earthly ties, Lord,/Break at Thy decree,/Let the tie that binds us,/Closer, sweeter, be."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He seeks neither compromise nor escape.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He asks only for better fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He jumps from the "sweet earthly ties" in the fifth line to "the tie that binds us."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The feeling is fine, the words are right, and the structure is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is beautiful!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since stanza two reaches the climax, stanza three turns into a prayer: "Lonely though the pathway,/Cheer it with Thy smile."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"Cheer it with Thy smile" this is so spiritual and poetic.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"Selfless may I live, Lord,/By Thy grace to be/Just a cleans d channel/For Thy life through me."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that he asks for nothing else except that he would be a selfless and holy vessel to carry out God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the prayerful finale of a consecrated person in suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we read this hymn carefully, we will see that this is truly a fine hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to come to God to learn these hymns and the spirit of these hymns.</S>
