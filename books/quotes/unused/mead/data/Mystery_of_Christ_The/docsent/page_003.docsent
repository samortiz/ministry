   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since the nature of the new man the church is Christ, we can say that the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us read two passages.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Luke 12:50-52 the Lord said, "I have a baptism to be baptized with,...Do you think that I have come to give peace on the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No, I tell you, but rather division."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why did the Lord say this?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said this because He had said that He would cast fire on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This fire is the fire of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means He would release His life on the earth to all those who would believe in Him so that they would be regenerated and receive God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This matter, however, could only be accomplished after His baptism, which refers to His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 12 reveals that the church is produced out of Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the grain of wheat that fell into the earth, died, and brought forth many grains the church in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From these two passages we can see that the church is produced by the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through His death and resurrection, Christ released His life and dispensed it into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These believers are then joined together to become the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE CHURCH BEING THE CORPORATE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament there are two ways to look at Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, He is Jesus Christ the Nazarene this is the individual Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, He is Christ plus the church the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Corinthians 12:12 refers to the second aspect when it says, "All the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Anything apart from Christ is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is only one thing in a Christian that forms a part of the church Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the church there is only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During the bread-breaking meeting, the portion that we break off from the whole still signifies the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is not what is added to Christ but what issues out from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today there are divisions among God's children because there are differences in organizations, personal views, concepts, choices, preferences, and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But in God's eyes the church is inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All these differences are merely outward differences; they are not differences in the intrinsic reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is the composition of all the believers with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When all the saints are joined together in Christ, we have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since there is only one Christ, there can be only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, it is indivisible and inseparable.</S>
