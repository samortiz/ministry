<h2 class="head1">THE DESTINY OF<br />
THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS<br />
IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 4:9 says, &ldquo;For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles last of all, as doomed to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.&rdquo; In Paul&rsquo;s time, when criminals fought with wild beasts in the amphitheater for the entertainment of the populace, the criminals were exhibited last of all. The apostles considered themselves as criminals doomed to death before the world, not as kings destined to reign. In 4:13 Paul said, &ldquo;Being defamed we appeal; we have become as the offscouring of the world, as the scum of all things until now.&rdquo; The destiny of the New Testament believers in the eyes of the world is firstly to be a spectacle like the criminals in the Roman amphitheater, then to be despised, looked down upon, and considered as the offscouring of the world and the scum of all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE UNLEAVENED BREAD<br />
TO BE OUR FEAST</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter five is Christ as the unleavened bread to be a feast to us (v. 8). This feast refers to the feast of unleavened bread as a continuation of the Passover (Exo. 12:15-20). It lasted seven days, a period of completion, signifying the entire period of our Christian life, from the day of our conversion to the day of rapture. This is a long feast which we must keep, not with the sin of our old nature, the old leaven, but with unleavened bread, which is the Christ of our new nature as our nourishment and enjoyment. Only He is the life supply of sincerity and truth, absolutely pure, without mixture, and full of reality. The feast is a time for the enjoyment of the banquet. The entire Christian life should be such a feast, such an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet, the rich supply of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING JOINED TO THE LORD<br />
AS ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In chapter six the crucial point is being joined to the Lord as one spirit that our body may be the temple of the Holy Spirit (vv. 17-20). Verse 17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Then verses 19 and 20 continue, &ldquo;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body.&rdquo; The crucial thing in these few verses is that our being joined to the Lord as one spirit is so that we could be the temple of God. This implies that when you are joined to the Lord as one spirit in your spirit, this joining should affect your body, control your body, and keep your body from anything that is evil, especially from fornication. Then, not only is your spirit the habitation of God but also your body. For your body to be a temple of the Holy Spirit means that your union with the Lord as one spirit affects your body in a positive sense. This effect is to separate your body, to sanctify your body, that not only your spirit but even your body is the temple of God. Thus, your entire being becomes the temple of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HUMAN OPINIONS GIVEN WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD</h2>
<p>The crucial point in chapter seven is that human opinions could be given with the Spirit of God. In verse 10 the apostle says, &ldquo;I charge, not I but the Lord.&rdquo; In verse 12 he says, &ldquo;I say, not the Lord.&rdquo; In verse 25 he says, &ldquo;I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful.&rdquo; Then in verse 40 he says, &ldquo;According to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; All these words indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation (that is, God and man, man and God becoming one). This differs drastically from the principle of Old Testament prophecy&mdash;speaking for God. In the Old Testament the word of Jehovah came upon a prophet (Jer. 1:2; Ezek. 1:3), the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God. But in the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles, and they become one with Him; thus they both speak together. His word becomes their word, and whatever they utter is His word. Hence, the apostle&rsquo;s charge is the Lord&rsquo;s charge (v. 10). What he says, though not by the Lord, still becomes a part of the divine revelation in the New Testament (v. 12). He is so one with the Lord that even when he gives his own opinion, not the commandment of the Lord (v. 25), he still thinks that he also has the Spirit of God. He does not claim definitely to have the Spirit of God, but he <em>thinks</em> that he <em>also</em> has the Spirit of God. This is the highest spirituality; it is based upon the principle of incarnation.</p>
