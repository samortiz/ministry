   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LONG PROCESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for the divine life to be dispensed into us, this life first had to pass through a long process involving incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, ascension, and descension.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The life dispensed into us is actually the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 1:1 this life could not be dispensed into man, for as yet it had not passed through the necessary stages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But now it is fully possible for such a wonderful life to be dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This life is present and available, and we can receive it simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>OUR SPIRIT BEING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 8:10 says, If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That the spirit in this verse is not the Holy Spirit is proved by the fact that here Paul contrasts the body with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul says that the body is dead but that the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We would expect him to say that the spirit is living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, he says that the spirit is life, or zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, this zoe gets into our spirit and causes our spirit to become zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now not only the Triune God is life, but our spirit is also life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we see this, we shall have the boldness to declare to the whole universe and especially to Satan that our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We shall proclaim that at least one part of our being, our spirit, is zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Oh, how we all need this revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May we see not only that we are saved and regenerated, but also that the innermost part of our being has become life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Knowing that our spirit is zoe will be a great help to us in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you are tempted to lose your temper, do not suppress your anger.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, simply declare, My spirit is zoe!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Likewise, if your wife or husband gives you a difficult time, do not argue, but tell the one troubling you that your spirit is zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Saying this enables us to resist Satan s temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord, our spirit is zoe !</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason that I am so lively and energetic is that my spirit is zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, I spent years in organized Christianity and no one told me that my spirit is zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was instructed in various religious practices, but I was not told that my spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But now I know that the divine zoe has been dispensed into my spirit, into the center of my being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now I know that my spirit has become zoe !</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>NOT THE BRIGHT VIRTUE,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BUT THE TRIUNE GOD AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Confucius was a great ethical philosopher who taught his disciples to develop what he called the inner bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What he called the bright virtue is actually the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The disciples of Confucius may have a bright virtue, but we have the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In fact, the very divine Being Himself has come into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no comparison between the bright virtue and the Triune God as the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we realized that our spirit was life, we were able to convince a number of philosophical teachers in China to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They boasted that they knew how to develop the bright virtue within.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After listening to them for a while, we would tell them that what they had was nothing in comparison to what we had.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some of them were very surprised and inquired honestly about this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We explained that as Christians we have the Triune God in us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We told them that what they have may be a bright virtue, something created by God, but what we have is the very Creator of this bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We helped them see that this Creator has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now He is both in ascension and available to come into anyone who calls on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result of such a testimony, many of those philosophical teachers opened to the Lord, called on His name, and received Him into them to be their life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then they themselves testified about the difference between the bright virtue and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By preaching the gospel on a high level in this way, we brought a good number of professors, doctors, nurses, and lawyers to the Lord.</S>
