It is significant that Romans 8:16 does not use the term the Spirit of God, as in Genesis 1:2, or the Holy Spirit, as in Matthew 1:18
There is a witness, a testimony, between the Spirit and our spirit, that we, children of Adam and fallen sinners, are now children of God
We were originally born of Adam, but as believers we also have been born of God and have thus become children of God
The Spirit witnesses with our spirit not that we are spiritually powerful or gifted but that we are children of God
The word image in verse 26 reveals that God's intention in creating man was that man would become God's expression
Our body is made of dust and is not close to God, but our spirit comes from the breath of God and is very close to God
After Christ, the Son, accomplished redemption on the cross, in resurrection He became the Spirit so that He could be applied to our being
The Spirit always witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God, born of God to possess the divine life
In regeneration, we are born of God to possess the divine life, and the Spirit comes into our spirit, making us one spirit with Him
Genesis 1:1-2 mentions God creating the heavens and the earth and the Spirit of God brooding upon the surface of the waters
At the beginning of the Bible it was the Spirit of God brooding, but at the end of the Bible it is the Spirit and the bride as one
Once we see that the Spirit with our spirit is the focal point of the Bible, we must begin to participate in it and practice it
We often do not walk according to the mingled spirit because of our nature, culture, ethics, religion, and habit
We may be ethical, moral, proper, righteous, just, and good yet not live and walk according to the mingled spirit
God does not want us to live in sin, nor does He want us to be ethical, moral, proper, righteous, just, and good persons
Within our being, the Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God, born of God to possess His life
Eventually, the Triune God as the Spirit will marry the tripartite man as His bride, and these two will become one
According to the principle in the Bible, the wife comes out of the husband , and the husband and the wife become one entity
The reason each one of us is a believer in the church life today is that in eternity past, before the universe was created, God chose us
We may have tried to avoid God for a long time, but eventually, we had to follow Him because He had already selected us and marked us out
We need to realize that we are living on the earth today not because of our intention but because God created us
Not only is man's mind higher than that of the animals, but also man has a spirit, which the animals do not have
Animals hunger only for physical food, but we hunger for God, because we have an organ that the animals do not have-a spirit
Regrettably, the gospel that most Christians preach today concerns only forgiveness of sins and eternal salvation
To be born of God is not a birth of blood and flesh but of the divine Spirit, not a physical, human birth but a spiritual, divine birth
The divine birth is altogether related to the two spirits, for it is a birth by and of the divine Spirit in our spirit
After experiencing this birth, we have three divine things in our spirit-the divine Spirit, the divine life, and the divine nature
When we believed and called on the Lord's name, He came into us like tea being added to water, and we were 'tea-ified,' made divine
Receiving the divine life and nature in regeneration is not a mere theological doctrine but a Christian experience
Just as water becomes tea-water when tea is added to it, so we become divinely human when God is added into us
We are still human, but we are no longer merely human because the divine life and nature with the divine Spirit have been added into us
Such a living is a religious performance based on a strong mind with a strong will but without life or the spirit
Although many sisters in the church life dress in a certain way and do not wear make-up, these are not church teachings or regulations
Some may feel that although they are doctrinally clear about walking according to the spirit and want to do it, they cannot make it
We may not know how to control our temper, but we have a spirit of sonship in which we can cry, 'Abba, Father'!
The mystery here is whether the spirit of sonship that we have received is the divine Spirit or the human sprit
The proper definition of mingling is that the divine nature is made one with the human nature without producing a third nature
Mingling may also be properly used to describe how the divine Spirit is made one with the human spirit of the believers
Although the words trinity and triune are not found in the Bible, the fact that God is triune is based on the revelation in the Word
In the same principle, although the word mingle is not used in the New Testament, the fact and the thought are there
The nature of the oil and the nature of the fine flour are preserved, but the two substances are mingled to compose one entity
The truth of mingling is scriptural, and to say that the Holy Spirit is mingled with the human spirit is altogether scriptural
We must have a basic knowledge of this matter before we can comprehend the proper and genuine experience of Christ
The spirit of sonship in Romans 8:15 is the mingled spirit-the divine Spirit dwelling in and mingled with our human spirit
The spirit of sonship is neither merely our human spirit nor merely the divine Spirit but the two spirits mingled together as one spirit
According to Galatians 4:6 it is the Spirit of God's Son who cries to the Father, and He cries from our hearts
Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit is with our spirit, but Galatians 4:6 says that God has sent the Spirit into our hearts
It is not easy to understand the human body, but it is even more difficult to understand man's invisible spiritual and psychological being
Because our spirit is in our heart , when the Spirit comes into our spirit, He spontaneously comes into our heart
When we consider Romans 8:15 and Galatians 4:6, we may wonder whether it is we or the Spirit who is crying to the Father
The one who is crying is the mingled spirit-the divine Spirit dwelling in our human spirit and mingled with our spirit as one
Just as we spontaneously exercise our legs when we walk, we spontaneously exercise our spirit when we cry to the Father or call on the Lord
Other Christians, such as Pentecostals, pray by moving their mouths to make unintelligible sounds until the Spirit 'moves'
Similarly, when praying, we do not need to wait for inspiration from God, nor do we need to make meaningless sounds
These verses show that the indwelling Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ Himself, and the Spirit of resurrection
The Spirit of God is the Spirit of the origin, the origination, the Originator, the Creator, and the Administrator of the universe
As the Spirit of Christ, the indwelling Spirit also includes all that Christ is and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained
The indwelling Spirit is also the Spirit of resurrection who has the resurrecting power, the power to raise ones from the dead
Resurrection includes ascension, glorification, enthronement, crowning, the highest name, the highest authority, headship, and lordship
Although the earth is round, the power of gravity keeps people safely on the ground on every side of the globe
We may say that it is God who shapes the child's face, but God does it through a law, the law of the human life
We experience the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, and this law frees us from the law of sin and of death
The verb dwells in verse 9 is a strong Greek word, meaning not merely to abide, remain, or stay but to make home, to reside
Romans 8:10 says, 'If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness'
The title the Spirit of God in verse 9 means that the Spirit is God, because the Spirit and God are grammatically in apposition
The Spirit includes the entire Triune God, who is life and who as life is the powerful law of the Spirit of life
Regardless of how good our natural life may be, God wants us to live not our natural life but the life that is the Triune God Himself
At the time of Abraham, God had created the universe and promised Abraham that He would accomplish many things, including incarnation
Now He is the Creator and the incarnated One who lived on the earth, passed through death, and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit
In ascension He has been glorified, crowned, enthroned, given the highest name, and made Lord and Head over all things
He has crushed Satan, subdued death, annulled sin, and terminated all the old creation, including our old man, our flesh, and our self
We may feel that although we enjoy the law of the Spirit of life in the meetings when we go home this law vanishes or is no longer powerful
Because the devil is always looking for an opportunity to defeat us, he will stir up the conflict with our spouse until we lose our temper
Living Him is like breathing-it is not something that we learn by studying but rather something that we do as a result of being alive
Based on this eternal intention, God created man so that man could take God in as life, be one with God, and become God's expression
Man's body is an outward organ to contact the physical things, and man's spirit is an inward organ to contact and receive God
Just as a transistor radio has a receiver that allows the radio to receive the radio waves, man has a spirit that enables him to receive God
After God created man in His image and with a spirit to contact and receive Him, He placed man before the tree of life
The Spirit today comprises divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, an all-inclusive death, and the power and life of resurrection
Before the Lord came to the disciples, they were in fear , but after they saw the resurrected Lord, they became joyful
We should not long for the Lord's visible presence, which was a feature of the primitive age of the Lord's earthly ministry
After the Lord helped them to catch an abundance of fish , He invited them to come and eat a meal that He had prepared for them
Today the Triune God has accomplished everything-creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, an all-inclusive death, and resurrection
No animal has ever worshipped something, but throughout human history every kind of people has worshipped something
Even atheistic governments have been unable to suppress the worship of God, because God created man with a spirit
Of making up our mind to be good, we should simply pray, 'Lord, thank You that You are the all-inclusive Spirit
If we pray sincerely in this way, we will spontaneously be good, not by our endeavoring or striving but by God
According to Romans 82 9 and 11 He is the Spirit of life the Spirit of God the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of the resurrecting One
We do not need to make up our mind to live properly and virtuously by our own effort, which does not work well anyway
The Triune God as the allinclusive Spirit has been installed in our being and this Spirit is a natural law a power that works automatically
As we are praying or calling on the name of the Lord, we sense deep within that life is flowing in to supply us
The way to cause the all-inclusive Spirit to function in us is to pray continually by calling on the name of the Lord
As soon as we switch on by calling on the Lord or by crying to the Father , the indwelling Spirit supplies us with God
As the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Christ, the indwelling Spirit supplies us with life, God, and Christ
In our daily life at home, work, or school, we may still live according to our old nature, culture, ethics, religion, and habits
Our entire living and daily walk, including any virtues such as humility, kindness, and love, must be the Triune God
As we pray continually in this way, we will keep ourselves in contact with the indwelling Spirit and live by the Spirit
It seems that God, who is all-powerful and can create simply by speaking, would do a quick work to accomplish His purpose
One day this oneness will finish passing through the process, and in eternity it will be a great city, the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the oneness of God and man, a great mingling of God with His redeemed people
To carry out the corporate oneness, which is the church and will become the New Jerusalem, there is the crucial need of Romans 8
Verse 10 says, 'If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness'
The Father is the source, the origin, the initiation; the Son is the course, the expression; and the Spirit is the application
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinctly three, but they are not separate, for they coexist and coinhere eternally
Though there is much electricity in a power plant, there must be a way for the electricity to be applied to buildings in a city far away
Once wires have been installed in a building, there is no need to petition the power plant for electricity to be applied to the building
There is only the need to switch on an appliance for the current of electricity to be brought into the building
Now that the Triune God as the Spirit has been installed in us, there is no need to fast and pray or petition God to receive the Spirit
Many great teachers say that in the Epistles Christ is identical with the Spirit, that Christ and the Spirit are one
The entire Bible reveals that the Triune God must be the Spirit in order to reach people and dispense Himself into them
Today we are in the stage of the sevenfold intensified Spirit, who is the application of the Triune God, the Triune God reaching us
Today the sevenfold Spirit is within us as the ultimate expression of the Triune God and as the application and reaching of the Triune God
We need the resurrecting Spirit to impart life into our mind, emotion, and will and even into our mortal body to resurrect us wholly
If we take the excuse that we do not know what to speak or how to function in the meeting, this indicates that our mind is dead
Similarly, we may complain that we are too tired to attend the meeting and insist that we need to stay home to rest
We need to realize that we have a rich, powerful, and all-sufficient Spirit indwelling us and must pay our full attention to Him
We should not be distracted by our background or what we are by nature, culture, religion, and habit but only care for the Spirit
By doing this, we open the way for the Triune God to infuse us with all that He is as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
By continually receiving the Triune God's dispensing, we will be infused with Him and live a life that expresses Him
It tells us that God today is the Spirit, and as the Spirit He is real, practical, and subjective to us because He indwells us
Because Romans 8 speaks of God as the indwelling Spirit, everything it reveals is practical and should be tested in our experience
He was crucified, dying an all-inclusive death to redeem us, terminate the old creation, and solve all the problems between God and man
Eventually, the Body will become the bride, and in eternity future, the New Jerusalem, the ultimate union of God and man
Verse 2 reveals that the Spirit is the Spirit of life and possesses a law, an automatic power, that functions within us
Because it was God who took the initiative to create the universe, He is the origin, the Originator, and the origination
After the old creation was terminated in Christ's crucifixion, the new creation was germinated with a new life in His resurrection
Next Christ ascended to the heavens, where He was crowned with glory and enthroned as the Lord and Head of the universe
The work of the Spirit in Romans 8 is to resurrect us by imparting the divine life into every part of our being
Now the all-inclusive Spirit dwells in our spirit and has mingled Himself with our spirit, making us one spirit with Him
The spirit in verse 4 refers not merely to the divine Spirit or the human spirit but to these two spirits mingled together as one spirit
We cannot fully understand our psychological heart, yet we know that we have such a heart because of the feelings it gives us
To live according to our nature is to do things quickly if we are a quick person or slowly if we are a slow person
Neither should we take the excuse of our culture, claiming that because we come from a certain place, we must behave a certain way
In the church meetings we are all one in spirit, but after the meetings we may make excuses based on our nature or culture
No matter if we are old or young, we have all built up habits, and much of the time we live according to habit
Our walk should be to daily live Christ, and we should have our being by practicing to be one spirit with the Lord
A daily walk according to the spirit will issue in the Body of Christ, the fullness of God, the new man, and the house of God
Walking according to the spirit will cause the bride to be prepared and will eventually usher us into eternity by bringing the Lord back
We must reject our nature, culture, ethics, religion, and habit and take the mingled spirit as the standard of our living
The first eighteen verses are especially abstract and mysterious because the main components of these verses are the Spirit and life
Our heart is quite mysterious and abstract, but within our heart is our spirit, which is more abstract and mysterious
Romans 8 speaks of the divine life, the uncreated life of God, that was given to us at the time we believed in Christ
When we have a heart for the Lord and begin to care for the spiritual things we immediately begin to consider our behavior conduct and deeds
We often make up our mind and pray for the Lord's grace and mercy to help us behave better and improve our conduct
To consider behavior and conduct rather than the Spirit and life shows that we are superficial and childish in the spiritual things
The expression the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead indicates that the Spirit is the resurrecting One
Just as the current of electricity conveys electricity, the Spirit of life conveys and imparts life into our being
Our concept is that we need to improve our behavior, conduct, and deeds, but God's concept is to infuse Himself into us as our life supply
When we are revived, we should not think about our behavior but should pick up God's concept to consider the inner life supply
Verse 10 says, 'If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness'
Our spirit is life because Christ, who is within us, supplies our spirit with life, causing our spirit to become life
To think about our behavior or conduct when we touch the things of God is a distraction and a subtle deception from the enemy
Whenever we touch the things of God, we need to realize that God wants to supply us with life and that the life supply is within us
We need to open our mouth and our entire being and cry to the Lord from the depths of our being, 'O Lord Jesus'!
When we cry in this way, we will immediately sense life flowing from the depth of our being to supply, refresh, water, and strengthen us
According to the revelation in Romans and 1 Corinthians, the things of the Spirit are the things concerning Christ
In John 16:13-14 the Lord said, 'When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality
Many years ago in Shanghai during a message Brother Watchman Nee asked a sister, 'How many buttons are on your dress'?
She was able to answer immediately, but when he asked her how many chapters there are in Matthew, she was unsure
With our spirit there is only the need of life but for our mind we need life and peace because our mind is complicated and is a troublemaker
The flaming darts of the evil one always come through our mind , but our mind will be protected if we set it on the things of Christ
When we set our mind on Christ, we will sense that our mind is refreshed, enlightened, and made sober and transparent
We will feel weak and exhausted if we stay home from a meeting, but we will be vigorous and full of energy if we attend the meeting
After hearing this teaching once again, she may repent and pray for the Lord to help her to submit to her husband
Because we are filled with life and peace, we believe that we can behave according to the teachings in the Bible
We need to open to the throne of grace, which is within us because the all-inclusive Spirit dwells in our spirit
If we simply remain open to this indwelling Spirit, the life supply will continually spring up from within our spirit
The more we turn our mind to the things of Christ and dwell on the things of Christ, the more supply of life we will receive
In this way, wives will spontaneously submit to their husbands, and husbands will spontaneously love their wives in a genuine way
A spiritual metabolism will work in our entire being to change us by supplying a new element and discharging the old element
