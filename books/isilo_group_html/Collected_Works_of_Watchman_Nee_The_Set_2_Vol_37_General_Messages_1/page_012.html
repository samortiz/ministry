God has not ordered all the members to have the same function. All the members are different. "For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function" (Rom. 12:4). How then can these members with different functions be linked and fitted together harmoniously in one Body? There are three basic principles which are essential for the harmonious functioning of the Body of Christ. The first defines the relationship between the Head and the members, the second, the relationship between the Body and the members, and the third, the responsibility of the members. All three principles are indispensable.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />THE HEAD (CHRIST) AND THE MEMBERS&mdash;<br />OBEDIENCE</h2><p>The meaning of a Christian's absolute surrender is in the words, "I will be obedient to the Lord; I will renounce my freedom and will not disobey authority." The first principle of living in the Body of Christ is to obey the authority of the Head. Both the existence of the Body and the function and activity of the Body depend on authority. Whenever authority has no place in us, the Body is paralyzed. Any part that is disobedient is paralyzed. A paralyzed body does not follow the directions of the head; where there is life, there is authority. If we want to have life, it is impossible to reject authority. Those who are full of life must obey authority. If my hand has life, it cannot resist the direction of the head. To be alive implies that we are being directed by the Head. Therefore, the first principle of living in the Body of Christ is to obey the Head. If we have not yet been dealt with in such a way as to be rendered obedient, what we know of the Body is only a matter of theory, not of life. God must deal with our fleshly life that we may see how blessed it is to be obedient to the Head. We must aim at obedience. Many times, we seek for opportunities to make good progress, to become holy, and to become righteous. We should similarly seek for opportunities to be obedient.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />THE BODY (THE CHURCH) AND THE MEMBERS&mdash;<br />FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>Our relationship with the Head is that of obedience, while our relationship with the Body is that of fellowship. Among the children of God, fellowship is a matter of reality and necessity. The life of the Body of Christ needs fellowship, without which there is only death. What is fellowship? Fellowship implies receiving of assistance from other members of the Body. For instance, I am the mouth; I can speak. But I need the fellowship of the ears in order to hear. I need the fellowship of the eyes to see. I need the fellowship of the hands to take things. I also need the fellowship of the feet to walk. Therefore, fellowship means that I receive a benefit from the special features of others.</p><p>Some Christians do not understand the principle of fellowship. They want to seek spirituality as individuals, to pray by themselves, to do everything by themselves, to be the mouth, the ears, the hands, and the feet at the same time. But those who know the Lord are not so; they need fellowship. Fellowship implies the fact that we are limited, inadequate, and willing to accept what comes from others and take it as our own.</p><p>Fellowship is not a mere doctrine but a reality. In the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year, can we honestly say that we pray well every day? Can we honestly say that we study the Bible well every day? Experience tells us that occasionally on account of poor health or for other reasons we cannot pray or read the Bible well. Then do we fail? Do we fall? No. During the week we can have fellowship with God on Monday and do reasonably well on Tuesday through Friday. On Saturday, we may feel tired and unable to read the Bible or pray well. Yet we are not doomed to failure on Saturday because there is an inexplicable strength supporting us. Saturday need not be any worse than the day before. This is because there is a supply from the life of the Body.</p><p>Many children of God have a similar experience, not once or twice but many times. Though we are weak, God carries us through because the members of the Body can mutually supply the needs of each other. Someone is praying, "May God be gracious to all His children." As life from another member of the Body flows into us, we are sustained. The life from the Body flows into us and carries us through. So we must realize that we live not merely by our own life but through the life that comes from the Body.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
