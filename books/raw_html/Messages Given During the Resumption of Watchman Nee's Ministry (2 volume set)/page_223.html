<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Need for the Strongest Point to Be Broken</H2><P>The nose is the most conspicuous part of the human body. If a man bumps into the wall, the first thing that hits it is his nose. For many people, when they express themselves, the strongest and most obvious things that come across to others are their cleverness or their thoughts. In order for a person to serve the Lord, the strongest part of his outward man must be broken. Only then will his inward man be released. We cannot be Christians for so many years and yet still remain whole and unchanged.</P><P>You can say that you have not received great revelations before the Lord. But you cannot say that for all these years, you have not received the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The goal of the discipline of the Holy Spirit is for you to be a broken man. One day, when you receive God's mercy, you will be able to say that at last you understand what it is to be a broken man. By that time, you will realize how easy it is for your spirit to be released. In order for the inward man to be released, there is the need for severe dealings from the Lord. Those who have never been dealt with cannot afford the Lord a way to go on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Mercy</H2><P>Every spiritual thing is received by men who are balanced and who are just right in everything. We can neither be too much nor too little. Those who are over-zealous in their pursuit will not receive anything. Neither will those who are lazy receive anything. When we ask, we have to ask in a proper measure; we cannot ask for nothing, and we cannot ask for too much. Sometimes when we ask more, it will be too much, and when we ask less, it will be too little. We need God's mercy. Spiritual growth does not depend on a person's running. But then, those who do not run will not receive anything either. If God grants you mercy, you will run according to just the right measure. For this reason, everyone has to commit himself to the God of all mercies (Rom. 9:16). If we do this, we will become just right in everything.</P><P>Today we can only say that we are those who have experienced God's mercy. Spiritual growth is something that is totally beyond man's power to control. God has to put us in a place of total inability and total helplessness before He can have a way in us. If the Lord is merciful to us, we will get through. If the Lord is not merciful to us, we can do nothing. Many people receive frequent chastisements, yet their outward man is not broken at all. In order to become a minister, the only way is for us to look to God's mercy. No one can be in haste in this matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having a Deeper Knowledge of the Lord's Life<br>through the Lord's Dealings</H2><P>Brother Yu Cheng-hwa asked: Can we say that the content of the ministry is our knowledge of life?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: We know the Lord by learning the lessons through His dealings and His smitings. When our outward man is broken, we will begin to know the Lord. A man knows the Lord through the process of being smitten. When we are smitten by the Lord day by day, our knowledge of the Lord will increase day by day, and we will see how His life replaces our life. This is not an increase in life, but an increase in knowledge. We have this life already. But through the Lord's dealings, we will gain a deeper knowledge of this life.</P>
