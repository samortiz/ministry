   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Establishing and Shepherding the Churches</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The three aspects of God's divine building are the church, the Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To work with God, to carry out the divine building of God in its three aspects, we co-workers and elders must first establish and shepherd the churches by the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must build up the churches by the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The building of the church is the ministry of Christ in His second stage.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His first stage there was only the mentioning of the church Matt 16:18; 18:17 ; there was not yet the actual building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the first stage He accomplished only the judicial redemption to redeem back the chosen people of God to be the material for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church is not built by Him in the ministry of His incarnation; the building of the church is accomplished by the pneumatic Christ as the Spirit in the ministry of His becoming the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we need to establish and shepherd the churches by the pneumatic Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit, with His organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our establishing and shepherding the churches should be carried out not only by Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit, but also by our applying His organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Building and Constituting the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second aspect of the divine building is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to build and constitute the Body of Christ by Christ as the sevenfold intensified Spirit with His sevenfold intensified organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This brings us into the third stage of Christ's full ministry, which is the stage of His intensification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The building of the church was not in the first stage, and strictly speaking, it is also not in the second stage, because it was not carried out successfully.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the second stage God was building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, instead of going forward, the church fell backward and degraded into a defeated church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, in Revelation, Christ has become the sevenfold intensified Spirit to build and constitute the Body of Christ in a sevenfold intensified way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Building may not be organic; a house is a building but it is inorganic.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the other hand, constituting is organic; our body is constituted organically.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Building may not be of life, but constituting must be of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in the divine and mystical realm, building and constituting are the same thing; we may call it building-constituting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is our new language.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must build and constitute the Body of Christ with life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To know how to build up the Body of Christ, we must study thoroughly the messages given in chapters two and three.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before we begin the building of the Body of Christ, we must know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we must begin with the second stage and then enter into the third stage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After we have entered into the third stage, we should not go backward, but we must remain in the third stage to daily experience the sevenfold intensification so that we may build and constitute the Body of Christ by Christ as the sevenfold intensified Spirit with His sevenfold intensified organic salvation.</S>
