THE REACTION OF DAVID</H2><P>In 2 Samuel 1 we see David's reaction to the death of Saul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Young Amalekite<br>Reporting the Death of Saul to David</H2><P>On the third day after Saul's death, a young Amalekite reported the death of Saul to David. In order to please David he told him that he saw Saul leaning on his spear and that Saul had asked him to kill him and that he had done so (vv. 1-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. David Condemning the Amalekite<br>for Killing the Anointed of Jehovah</H2><P>David was not pleased with the report of the young Amalekite, but rather condemned him for killing the anointed of Jehovah and sentenced him to death (vv. 11-16). David did not consider Saul his enemy but always regarded him as God's anointed. This was David's view of Saul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. David Singing a Dirge<br>over Saul and over Jonathan His Son</H2><P>David was deeply saddened by the death of Saul. David sang a dirge over Saul and over Jonathan his son, and he commanded that The Song of the Bow be taught to the children of Judah (vv. 17-27).</P><P>The record of Saul's terrible end is a strong warning to all the serving ones in the kingdom of God not to do a separate work within the kingdom of God or to abuse anything in the kingdom. In the Lord's recovery we must be in fear and trembling, always working for God's kingdom and not for our own work.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_083.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_085.html">Next</a> </body></html>
