However, some of John&#8217;s disciples drifted away from his goal, Christ, to some of his practices, and made those practices a religion. To be religious is to do something for God, without Christ. To do anything, even if it is scriptural and fundamental, without the presence of Christ is to be religious. Both John&#8217;s disciples...and the Pharisees, who were...without Christ...made fasting a matter of religion. Meanwhile, they condemned the disciples of Christ, who did not fast but had Christ with them and lived in His presence.</p><p>In the case of the new religion, the Lord is not only the Physician but also the Bridegroom....Now Christ, the kingly Savior, reminded some of them of this. The kingly Savior first healed His followers, and then made them the sons of the bridechamber; eventually, He will make them His bride....They were with Him at a joyful wedding, not without Him at a mournful funeral. How then could they fast and not feast before Him?</p><p>In 9:16 the Lord continues with something even finer, sweeter, and more intimate....The Greek word translated unfulled...means...unfinished, unshrunk, untreated. The unfulled cloth signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion, as a piece of new cloth, untreated, unfinished; whereas the new garment in Luke 5:36 signifies Christ as a new robe after He was &#8220;treated&#8221; in His crucifixion....Christ first was the unfulled cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God that we might be justified by God and be acceptable to Him (Luke 15:22; Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 1:30). A patch of unfulled cloth sewn on an old garment pulls away from the garment because of the strength of its shrinking, thus making the tear worse. To sew a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment means to imitate what Christ did in His human life on earth....The old garment in verse 16 signifies the good behavior, good deeds, and religious practices produced by man&#8217;s old, natural life.</p><p>The new wine [v. 17] signifies Christ as the new life [who] strengthens us, energizes us, and makes us very happy....Old wineskins signify religious practices, such as the fasting maintained by the Pharisees, who were of the old religion, and by the disciples of John, who were of the new religion. All religions are old wineskins. New wine put into old wineskins bursts the wineskins by the power of its fermenting....The new [fresh] wineskin is the church life...Christ enlarged....He is the Bridegroom, the new garment, the new wine, and also the corporate vessel to contain what we enjoy of Him. The meaning here is very profound.
