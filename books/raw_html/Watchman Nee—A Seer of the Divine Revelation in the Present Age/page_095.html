<P>In this letter, Watchman Nee referred to his sickness more than once. Diacin is a tradename of Niacin, a nicotinic acid. Angina pectoris, the chronic illness which he had, is a disease which causes chest pain due to a lack of blood supply to the heart muscles.</P><P>"Ma Hsing-tao" is Watchman's nephew-in-law, the husband of his niece who was the daughter of his cousin. During his imprisonment, this nephew-in-law and his wife took care of Mrs. Nee, who had poor health. Both he and his wife were brother and sister in the Lord. Eventually, his wife died, leaving this nephew-in-law to take care of Mrs. Nee alone.</P><P>On the same day that the above letter was written, Watchman wrote another letter to this relative (see Letter Five).</P><P style="text-align:center">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Letter Five</H2><P>May 22, 1972<br>Nephew-in-law Hsing-tao,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>I believe your aunt, while she was alive, must have talked to you about my situation.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>You know that my eldest sister is supplying my needs; therefore, my living is no problem. I am old and with much illness, longing very much to be with my relatives. As a falling leaf returning to its root, so I seek a final resting place. I earnestly hope that you could take the responsibility to accomplish this matter for me. In every respect I am depending on you.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Because of the death of your aunt six and a half months ago, all my five internal organs hurt, and it is difficult for me to pass through the days. I hope that you would make every effort to mail the certificate here. When your aunt was alive, she many times mentioned Hwei-yi and her children. I wonder how the children are now? I miss them.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>I heard that going to Chekiang may cause a problem with the food coupons. I believe since I eat very little, there will be a solution; so it does not matter.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>For more than twenty years we have not corresponded with each other. You are often in my remembrance.</P><P>I wish you well.</P><P>Shu-tsu</P><P style="text-align:center">_______________________________________________________________________________________________________</P>
