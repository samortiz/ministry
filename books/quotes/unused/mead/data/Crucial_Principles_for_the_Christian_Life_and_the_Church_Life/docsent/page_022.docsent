   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Praying according to John 17:21-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>concerning the Genuine Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 17:21-23 is a healthy word containing a great revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The thought in these verses is beyond our human understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, we need to be impressed with these three main points: our being in the Triune God v. 21 , the glory, the expression, of the Triune God that makes us one v. 22 , and the Triune God being in us that we may be perfected into one v. 23 . We need to bring these three points to the Lord in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To keep the oneness, we need the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many saints may be spontaneously and naturally in the oneness today, but they may not have been tested yet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a test comes, they may feel that they cannot keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word in this chapter is intended to help us to realize the need of the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although we may have been in the church life for years, we may easily fall out of the Lord s recovery if we lack the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 17:21-23 reveals what the genuine oneness is and the way for us to have the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>CHRIST AS LIFE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE NATURE OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AND ONENESS BEING THE STANDING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to realize what the Lord s recovery is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord s recovery is the recovery of mainly two items: Christ as life and the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ as life is the nature of the Lord s recovery, and oneness is the standing, the ground, of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything in the universe has a nature and a standing; nothing exists without a nature and a standing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord s recovery exists by its nature and by its standing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We saw in the previous chapter that the church is nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, Christ as life is the content, the nature, of the church in the Lord s recovery, and the genuine oneness is the standing of the church in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The nature and standing of the church Christ as life and the genuine oneness are both lacking to the uttermost in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If our nature is not Christ as life and our standing is not the genuine oneness, the Lord s recovery will become merely a continuation of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The difference between Christianity and the Lord s recovery is that Christianity does not have Christ as its nature or the genuine oneness as its standing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead of Christ, Christianity has various things as its nature; it is an organization built upon certain concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of genuine oneness, Christianity is full of divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord s recovery, in contrast, has only one thing as its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is the unique nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because the church is composed entirely of Christ, Christ alone is the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The standing, the ground, of the church is the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we lose the genuine oneness, we are immediately no longer the church or the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, we become a continuation of Christianity, having the same nature and standing as Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To remain in the Lord s recovery, we must keep these two things: Christ as life and the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>UNTIL WE ALL ARRIVE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AT THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now we will go on to see how to keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ephesians 4:3 says, Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 13 says, Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These two verses mention two kinds of oneness the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all have the oneness of the Spirit because we all have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, what we need to do today is to keep the oneness of the Spirit until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith.</S>
