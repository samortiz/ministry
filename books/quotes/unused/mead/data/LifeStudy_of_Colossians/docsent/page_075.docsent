   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING DIED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM THE ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:20 Paul points out that we have died with Christ from the elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These elements include Jewish observances, heathen ordinances, and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They also include mysticism and asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The elements of the world are the elementary principles of worldly society, the rudimentary principles invented by mankind and practiced in society.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With Christ we have died to these elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When Christ was crucified, we were crucified also.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In His crucifixion we were released from the elementary principles of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since we have died with Christ from the elements of the world, Paul asks us why as living in the world we subject ourselves to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a rebuking tone, Paul asked the believers in Colosse why they continued to subject themselves to ordinances, referring to the very elementary principles from which they had died in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The world in this verse refers not to the physical earth, but to human society, to mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, Paul was asking the believers why they still subjected themselves to ordinances as if they were still living in human society.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 21 Paul lists some of these ordinances: Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These are rules and regulations in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These rules refer respectively to things that move, to things that are edible, and to things that are tangible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Handling, tasting, and touching include virtually every kind of action.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because these regulations are related to the practice of asceticism, to submit to ordinances concerning handling, tasting, and touching is to practice asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many years ago I met a brother who had been an orthodox Jew before becoming a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our fellowship together, he related many stories about various Jewish practices.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He told me that some orthodox Jews place their shoes in a certain direction when they retire for the night, a practice supposedly based on a verse in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They believe that if they do not place their shoes in the proper direction, they will lose God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What superstition!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am amazed that the Jews, an intelligent people who value education, could be so superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who do not have Christ and the cross are often superstitious and also given to the practice of asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>PASSING THROUGH THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As those who have the one Person and the one way, we do not need regulations about where to place our shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we go to bed at night, however, we should pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that no matter what we have done during the day or what has happened to us, the cross takes care of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose in the afternoon you are made unhappy in some way by your wife or husband.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At bedtime you need to apply the cross to your feeling of unhappiness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do this, the feeling of unhappiness will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that our way is the cross, not asceticism or any severe treatment of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Realizing that we have already died in Christ, we should go to bed at night with a consciousness of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we practice going to bed through the cross, lying down with the realization that we have died in Christ, the next morning we shall wake up in resurrection as a new person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We not only have Christ, the unique Person who is versus all things; we also have the cross, the unique way, which is versus all other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we have Christ and the cross, there is no place for self-imposed humility.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no need for us to train ourselves to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have observed, both in the Orient and in the West, that the most proud people are those who have learned to practice a form of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need not learn such practices.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we should simply take the unique way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Driving down the street can be a reminder of the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we drive, we come to many intersections.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Have you realized that every intersection is a cross?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some of these crosses may be large and others may be small, but they are all crosses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only by passing through many crosses can we get to our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Speaking of spiritual experience, we also must pass through many crosses before we can reach the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Just as we cannot travel very far geographically without crossing an intersection, so we cannot progress spiritually without passing through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only when we arrive at the New Jerusalem shall we cease to pass through the cross, for by that time all the negative things will have been eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Until we come to the New Jerusalem, we need to pass through the cross day by day in our walk with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I can testify that it is a healthy spiritual practice to pass through the cross every night when we go to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By applying the cross at the end of each day, I rest very well during the night.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At bedtime we need to apply the cross to every problem and to every negative, natural, or sinful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may pray, Lord, I want all these things to pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I do not want to go to sleep with any natural, sinful, negative, or worldly element that has not been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When I go to bed, Lord, I want to be a person who has been crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to be those who pass through one cross after another.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I encourage you to daily pass through the intersection of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because we have Christ as the unique Person and the cross as the unique way, we do not need asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, we do not even need to make up our minds with respect to certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Such a practice does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What we need to do is simply lie down through the cross at night, have a restful sleep, and then rise up in the morning in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Praise the Lord that the experience of Christ s death is versus asceticism!</S>
