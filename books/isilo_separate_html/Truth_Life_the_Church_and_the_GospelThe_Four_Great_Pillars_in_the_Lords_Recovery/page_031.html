for the Believers</h2>
<p>On the one hand, the Lord has to build the believers into the church, and on the other hand, the believers cannot leave the church. In Matthew 18 the Lord said that if a brother refuses to hear the church, let him be just like a Gentile (v. 17). This does not mean that we should excommunicate him but that because this brother does not behave properly, we cannot regard him as a brother; instead, we should regard him as a Gentile. Hence, for a believer to leave the church is a kind of punishment. For this reason, in the church we should seriously receive the dealings arranged for us by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Producing and the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>The Lord mentions the church in the Gospel of Matthew, but the church had not yet been produced at that time (16:18; 18:17). However, as recorded in Acts, one day three thousand people were saved and then about five thousand on another day (2:41; 4:4). In chapter eight, instead of being called the believers in Jerusalem, they were called the church in Jerusalem (v. 1). In Acts 9:31; 12:1; 13:1; and 14:23, the believers in different places were called the church in those places. Chapter fourteen records that Paul went out to preach the gospel, passed through many places, and led many people to the Lord. Perhaps in less than a year Paul went back to these places and &ldquo;appointed elders for them in every church&rdquo; (v. 23). Those believers had been saved for no longer than a year, but the Bible still calls them the church, and there were some who became elders in the same year that they were saved.</p>
<p>According to our concept we tend to think that a group of newly saved people cannot be considered the church. They can only meet together, and there is no way to appoint elders from among them. How could a Christian who has been saved less than a year be an elder? However, Paul did not think this way. Right after he had preached the gospel and led some people to be saved, he came back to those places, called them churches, and appointed elders in place after place. No doubt, those churches were young churches and those elders were &ldquo;baby elders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although we are all spiritual children when we are saved, once we start meeting and living in the church life, we spontaneously grow. The church is a place that causes us to grow. Perhaps someone will say that since he has been saved for thirty-eight years, whenever he comes to the meetings, he finds that everyone there is either a spiritual child or a young person, so he simply stays at home. However, he has never considered that if he stays at home, he will become a thirty-eight-year-old child, &ldquo;an elderly infant.&rdquo; If we want to grow, we must remain in the church. Once a person stops meeting with the church for two or three weeks, immediately he stops growing. If he does not meet for two years, he will become like a child again. If he stops attending the meetings for another three years, he will be nearly finished in his spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Able to Grow in Life Only in the Church</h2>
<p>This is a wonderful matter. Even though the condition of the church may not be good, when people come to meet, they spontaneously grow in life. Never think that in the church meetings the message is not good enough, the sharing is not up to the standard, the singing is a mess, and that you would rather stay at home. If you do so, you will lose many blessings, and your spiritual life will wither. The principle of God&rsquo;s blessing is that His blessing is in the Body, the church. Hence, attending the worst church meeting is better than staying at home, because whoever becomes individualistic loses the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. If we want to be blessed, enjoy grace, and grow in life, we have to attend the church meetings. Even though we may just be following others to pray and sing in the meetings, we will still grow in life. For example, suppose there is a church that truly resembles the church in Laodicea; it is neither hot nor cold. When people come to the meetings, they become sluggish, wanting to rest and sleep. Even the elders doze there. However, even if this is the case, as long as we do not leave the church we will still grow in life, because God&rsquo;s blessing is in the church.</p>
<p>Some people may argue, saying, &ldquo;I can read the Bible anywhere. I can come near to the Lord at home.&rdquo; This is true, but if you leave the church and pursue the Lord at home, your pursuit surely will not last long. You may be able to rise up at six on the first day, but on the second day you will change your rising time to 6:15. On the third day you will change it to 6:45, on the fourth day you will postpone it until 7:15, and on the fifth day, you may not get up at eight. Then on the sixth day you may not even want to come near to the Lord. Thus, it is impossible to pursue the growth in life apart from the church. The blessing is in the church. Even the weakest church is stronger than the individual.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> </body></html>
