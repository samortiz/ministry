   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning Judgment with Satan</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>unto Eternal Perdition</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit also convicts the world concerning judgment with Satan unto eternal perdition v. 11 . Between God and man, there are three crucial things sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we have seen, sin came from Adam and righteousness is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Surely judgment is for the evil one, Satan Matt 25:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this whole universe, Adam, Christ, and Satan are the three biggest roles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We were born in Adam, in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we believe into Christ, we receive Him as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If not, we will go with Satan to share his judgment in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While the Spirit is seeking us out, He convicts us concerning this sin, concerning this righteousness, and concerning this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to learn these things because we are going out to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can read Luke 15:8 to the ones for whom we are caring to show them the Spirit's seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we can read John 16:8-11 to them to show them the Spirit's convicting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I believe every contact would be happy to hear this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that in order to be effective in our contact with people, we must study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can present some verses from the Bible to them with the proper definition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we will gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should learn how to preach these things so that the seeking Spirit can light our words to make them shine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then others will be convicted and repent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. Leading Them to: 1.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Repent unto God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Luke 15 there are the Spirit's seeking and the Spirit's stirring up to lead us to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The third parable in Luke 15 is concerning a father receiving his son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verses 18 through 21 tell us what happened when the prodigal son decided to return.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And he rose up and came to his own father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The prodigal son suddenly said that he would rise up and go to his father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As sons we rose up and came to our Father because we were stirred up by the seeking and convicting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the son to say, "Father, I have sinned," is for him to make a confession following his repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When he said that he would be as one of his father's hired servants, this meant that he wanted to work for his father to gain his father's favor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once a fallen sinner has repented, he thinks of working for God or of serving God to obtain His favor, not knowing that this thought is against God's love and grace and is an insult to His heart and intent.</S>
