   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE CHURCH THE BODY OF CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE FULLNESS OF THE ONE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>WHO FILLS ALL IN ALL Scripture Reading: Eph 1:1-23</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The crucial focus of the book of Ephesians is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other messages we have pointed out that this book is structured with the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, a meeting hall may be structured mainly with steel, wood, and stone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In like manner, the entire book of Ephesians is structured with the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now let us come to Ephesians chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the title of this message indicates, the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in Ephesians issues in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the divine dispensing produces the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the dispensing the church cannot be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Chapter one tells us that the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, is the issue of God s dispensing Himself into His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE ENJOYMENT OF THE DIVINE GRACE AND PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 1:2 says, Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most Christians, including myself, have simply read this verse and taken for granted that they understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although I had read this verse for many years, I did not realize what grace and peace are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now I see that grace in the New Testament is nothing less than God dispensed into our being for our enjoyment John 1:14, 17; Rom 5:17, 21; 1 Cor 15:10; 2 Cor 12:9; 13:14; Gal 6:18; 1 Pet 4:10; 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Grace is a Person, the very God Himself, dispensed into our spirit to be our life and life supply so that we may enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you read the New Testament with this understanding, the word grace will be much more meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Grace denotes God as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is peace?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peace surely does not refer simply to a calm situation in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peace is not something outward, but something inward.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Peace within us is the result of the enjoyment of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we enjoy God as grace, the result is peace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peace is the issue, the result, the fruit, of our enjoyment of the very God within us, the One who has been dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to my experience, such a peace implies five matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, it implies rest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do not have rest, you cannot have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peace also implies comfort, enjoyment, satisfaction, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I enjoy God as my inward portion, I have rest, comfort, enjoyment, satisfaction, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is peace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Outwardly I may have problems, yet inwardly I have the enjoyment of God, and I am a happy person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is peace as the issue of the enjoyment of God as our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This enjoyment of the divine grace and peace is to the saints and the faithful in Christ Jesus, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>BY THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How can we have the enjoyment of God that results in peace?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can have this by the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you read chapter one of Ephesians again with this kind of understanding, it will be a new chapter to you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all need to have our mind renewed when we come to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means we need to drop our understanding from the past.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The old understanding which we have picked up in the past has become a thick veil upon our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I hope that all the layers of the veils will be taken away from our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we shall be able to take the Bible purely as it is and see the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The pure Word indicates that grace and peace may be to us by the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first item is the Father s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Father, our God, is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is one unique God, yet He is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is one God, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I cannot tell you how this can be, nor can I explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Martin Luther said that if we fully understood the Trinity, we must be God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only God knows this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is too mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot understand how the one unique God can be triune.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even the more, no one can explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Through nearly twenty centuries of Christian history, teachers and theologians have tried to explain the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But in doing so they have made mistakes and caused problems.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have learned a lesson from them and received a warning, so that we do not like to explain too much.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We prefer to speak according to what the pure Word reveals.</S>
