   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY CONCERNING THE MEETINGS IN THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the present situation, among all the meetings of the new way, the group meeting is a very complicated one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the group meeting there are those who have been saved for a longer time as well as the newly baptized ones; those who attend the district meetings as well as those who do not attend them; those who break bread in the homes, and those who break bread in the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The group meetings are composed of different sorts of people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Besides this, we have the goal of bringing all the students into the district meetings and even into the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At present, the church in Taipei can be compared to a large chop-suey mixing pot.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not only is the number of serving ones great; the items of services are also many.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, in practice, we need much of the Lord s grace that we may meet all the needs when we serve, and may be able to coordinate the serving ones from all the different areas together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE PRESENT SITUATION AND NEED</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all know that it is much easier to do anything if we have only one line of action.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there are many lines it will be rather difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are now facing a situation with many lines.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Besides those attending the district meetings, we still have over five thousand people to care for.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among them there are two thousand who were recovered from the gospel festival, and three thousand who were brought in from the door-knocking during the past two years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They came from every part of society.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have meetings every week, and their condition is quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But they only like to meet in the homes; they do not want to come to the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From this aspect, our burden in taking care of them is too heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Besides this, among our trainees, we also have a very complicated situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are the local ones and also those from overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Among those from overseas, most are from America, and some are also from Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The lengths of the training periods they have attended are also different.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some are already in their third term, whereas some have been here only a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Besides this, there are the one-week trainings, the two-week trainings, the six-week trainings, the housewives training and the older saints training.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is very difficult to sort out all these aspects and have them in order.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church in Taipei has been here for thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It surely is qualified to be called an old church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Superficially speaking, our number is quite large.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, it is not large enough.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Throughout the past years, according to our statistics, we have had only one hundred fifteen thousand people under our care.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not a large number.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason for this is that our former system of meeting was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We were not able to perfect the functions within all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a result, although our number grew larger and larger, those whose function has been truly manifested are few.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is our big lack.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>RECOVERING GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our training here has a definite goal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This goal is to recover God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The content of God s New Testament economy is that God is working Himself into a group of people, that they may become the Body of Christ as God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the local churches in the different localities today and the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth in the future as His ultimate manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although this word is simple, its content is very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order for us to have a clear vision, we need to first see what kind of God our God is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Next, we need to see how He is working Himself into a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then, we want to see what kind of people are those into whom He is working Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As to God, He is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to work Himself into man, He needs some steps.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These steps are the various processes He has gone through, which include the Father s choosing and predestinating and the Son s incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Son came to earth, He came with the Father and by the Spirit, and lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the end He willingly went into death, gave up His soul-life, was nailed to the cross, and accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After that, He walked into Hades and death and came out from there and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In resurrection, He became the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He then breathed this Spirit into those who believed in Him to become their life, their content, their supply, and everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From then on, those who are chosen and called by God and who believe into Him can receive and possess Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not only are they regenerated; they are sanctified and transformed as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To the Father they have become His many sons, and to the Son, His many members.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way, the many members of the Son are constituted one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When this Body is expressed in the different localities, they are the local churches.</S>
