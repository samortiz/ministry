   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FIFTY THE MAN-SAVIOR S PRESENTATION OF HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO DEATH FOR REDEMPTION 7 Scripture Reading: Luke 22:7-46</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that in 22:7-20 we have both the Passover and the Lord s supper.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verses 7 through 18 there is a record concerning the eating of the Passover, and in verses 19 and 20, a record concerning the Lord s instituting His supper so that the disciples may participate in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Passover the main thing enjoyed by God s chosen people was the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The meat of the lamb was for them to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in the Lord s table the main item for us to enjoy as New Testament believers is not a lamb; the main item for our enjoyment is bread.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is very significant, and in this message we need to consider this in more detail than we have done previously.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Lord Jesus was offered to God for our redemption, He was offered not as bread but as a Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the outcome is not the Lamb but bread.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lamb was a single entity, but bread is something corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not possible for a single grain of wheat to form a loaf of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A loaf is a corporate entity, something composed and constituted of many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With the feast of the Passover there is not the concept of feasting on something that is corporate in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But with the Lord s table the symbols, especially the loaf, bear a very significant characteristic, and this characteristic is that of a corporate entity, a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is very important that we realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The loaf in the Lord s table points to something that comes after the Lord s death; it signifies something that issues from the Lord in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is signified by the loaf is not something before the Lord s death, but something after His death and in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before His death, the Lord Jesus was a single, individual Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But what issues out of His death in resurrection is a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This entity is the loaf, the bread, which signifies a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Gospel of Luke, of course, we do not see much development concerning the bread of the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to remember, however, that Luke s impression of this came from Paul s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regarding the bread, we should go from Luke 22 to Paul s word in 1 Corinthians 10:17: Seeing that we who are many are one bread, one Body; for we all partake of the one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we see that the bread signifies not only the physical body of the Savior; it also signifies His mystical Body, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not a matter of an individual; it is a matter of a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are all one bread, one Body, because we all partake of the one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our joint partaking of the one bread testifies that we all are one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that our partaking of Christ makes us all His one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The very Christ of whom we all partake constitutes us into His one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Gospel of Luke the word church is not used.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, there are certain hints, or indications, of the church in this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For instance, in chapter ten the inn refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, the house of the father in chapter fifteen indicates the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, there is a hint concerning the church in the parable of the vineyard in chapter twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Jewish leaders are likened to vinedressers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to 20:16, the vinedressers are destroyed, and the vineyard is given to others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These others are the New Testament believers, who are the components of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 20:17 and 18 the Lord went on to refer to Himself as the cornerstone: What then is this that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This cornerstone surely is for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is another strong indication that the church is referred to in this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now in chapter twenty-two the loaf is related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the development elsewhere in the New Testament, the loaf, the bread, signifies the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the loaf in 22:19 points to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before His death the Man-Savior was a Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But after His death and in His resurrection, He became a loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Old Testament feast of the Passover the enjoyment was of the lamb, but in the New Testament feast the enjoyment is of the loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lamb has become a loaf through the process of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the Lord s table we display, exhibit, the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we display His death in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever we come to the Lord s table, we should keep in mind that we are not in His death but in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because we are now participating in the loaf, in the Lord s resurrection we are displaying His death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This loaf includes not only the Lord Himself; it includes the Lord with us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the loaf is no longer the individual Christ; it is now the corporate Christ 1 Cor 12:12 , including the Lord Jesus and the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the institution of the Lord s table the loaf is the main element.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the cross we see the Lamb, but on the table we see the loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we are at the Lord s table, we need to realize that the loaf includes the Head and the Body; that is, it includes Christ and all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, it is a complete loaf, a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Praise the Lord that the Lamb has become the loaf!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Through His death and in His resurrection, the Lamb has become the loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to John 12:24, the Lord fell into the earth and died as a grain of wheat and then in resurrection became a loaf composed of many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This loaf is inexhaustible!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After considering the Lord s table again and again for many years, I can testify that the bread and the cup are inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Before the Lord Jesus went to the cross, He was the Lamb individually.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But after passing through death and coming forth in resurrection, He became a loaf that includes both Him and us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Furthermore, the blood He shed on the cross has become a covenant, and this covenant has become a cup, a portion that is God Himself as a blessing for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God is alloted to us in this cup; He is our portion for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this we see the significance of the Lord s supper instituted in chapter twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We thank the Lord for giving us such an understanding of His supper.</S>
