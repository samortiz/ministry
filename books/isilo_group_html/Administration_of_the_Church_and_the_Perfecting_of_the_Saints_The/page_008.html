<h1 class="title">PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A STRONG SPIRIT AND<br />
MUCH PRAYER IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We need to live in our spirit all the time, just as we need to breathe all the time. We do not have certain places where we breathe and certain places where we do not breathe. We come to the meetings to breathe. Therefore, instead of waiting for others, we should be strong in our spirit, actively exercising and releasing our spirit, and we must pray much. The meeting is ours; hence, everyone should open his mouth to pray. Every meeting is our assembling together; it is a time for us to pray with our spirit. Everyone should pray in the meetings. We must practice this.</p>
<p>Our meetings are open, and we have the spirit and life. Hence, we should be aggressive to pray one after another. In contrast, our meetings are abnormal, because they are full of regulations and rituals, and they lack the aggressiveness of the spirit and the spontaneity of life. In the United States when the co-workers and elders gather together, they only pray. They do not care whether there is a speaker in the meeting; they only care to pray aggressively. Everyone prays, and there are no pauses. We have gathered from various places to seek the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Hence, it is proper for us to pray instead of relying on a message. All the churches need to receive grace from the Lord in order to have a drastic change.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS PERFECTING OTHERS,<br />
NOT LORDING IT OVER THEM</h2>
<p>Concerning the service of the elders, in some places the elders have become everything in the church. They must be consulted for every matter, and everything depends upon their decision. This is too much. There should not be hierarchy among the believers. We are all brothers. There cannot be only one or two people in a local church. In a church with a few hundred or a few thousand people, there is the need for a few responsible ones to take the lead and to make arrangements concerning the church affairs. The Lord does not want a disorderly situation among His children. Therefore, the principle in the Bible shows that the elders are needed in the local churches. It is right for the brothers and sisters to obey the elders, but this does not mean that the elders are the officials in the local churches. It is wrong for the elders to be more overbearing than officials.</p>
<p>The elders are appointed by the apostles, but they should not think that they are elders only because they were appointed by the apostles. It is wrong for the elders to have such a bureaucratic and hierarchical view. The elders need to be appointed by the apostles, because those who are weighty are usually humble and do not fight to be first, whereas those who are insignificant want to be first. The apostles, who have spent much time with the Lord and are led by Him, need to appoint the elders; otherwise, the insignificant ones would rise up to be elders, and the proper persons would humbly retreat. Hence, the elders need to be appointed by the apostles. However, we should not have the concept that the apostles are popes appointing officials. There is no such practice in the church. Whether a brother should be an elder is between him and the Lord. Every saint has received a different measure of grace to fulfill his function and portion.</p>
<p>It is beautiful for the elders&rsquo; shepherding, teaching, and care to cover every detail and aspect of the church life. This is necessary. In some localities, however, every matter requires the elders&rsquo; approval. In many churches most of the affairs have been in the hands of the elders for ten or even twenty years. There is no building up in these localities. The elders should not keep anything in their hands; instead, they should commit everything to the deacons. The function of the elders is to oversee, not to handle things directly. The common problem among the elders is that they keep things in their hands and take care of things themselves; they do not allow others to be responsible. If there are a few who find favor with the elders, the elders will arrange for them to handle some matters. This, however, is not the church; this is not the building.</p>
<p>Building the church may be likened to building a house or making a piece of furniture. As long as the materials are available, they should be put to use, regardless of their size or value. Any person who is not put to use in a locality will become a problem, just like unused materials at a construction site that are heaped in a pile and become a problem. Some elders blame the saints for being material of poor quality. What kind of material is good? In order to build up the church, we need to use all kinds of materials. The larger ones are useful, and the smaller ones are useful. The ones whom we consider to be valuable are useful, and the ones whom we consider to be less valuable are also useful. However, if these materials are left on the ground, they will become a problem. When all the materials are used for the building, there will be no problem.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Perfecting of the Saints &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
