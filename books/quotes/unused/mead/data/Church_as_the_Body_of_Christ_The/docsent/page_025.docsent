   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FIRST CONTENT OF THE FULLNESS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the content of the fullness?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 11:25 the Lord said very clearly that He is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that the first item of the fullness is life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we touch the fullness, we will surely touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not touch life, we have not touched the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps someone would ask, what is life?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Life is something living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first expression of life is that it is living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whatever has life must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This does not refer to something being lively; rather, it refers to something being living, being alive and full of vigor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With some saints, their goodness is out of themselves, but with other saints their goodness is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can say that the goodness of some saints is merely behavior, but the goodness of other saints is life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The distinction is that the goodness of some people is without vigor; it is the same as something that is dead, without the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the goodness of others is full of vigor, full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, the goodness of some people is dead, but the goodness of other people is living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Often we contact a group of brothers and sisters who are good, yet their goodness can be compared to a piece of dead wood with no vigor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We touch their goodness, but we cannot touch vigor and life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, in reading the Epistles of the New Testament, whenever we touch the goodness of the apostles, we touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the same way, in some Christians we touch goodness as well as life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some have a meekness that can be compared to the meekness of a stone statue; they are truly meek, but there is no life in their meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some have a meekness that has life within; when we touch that meekness, we touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How is it possible to distinguish whether a person s meekness and goodness is of the self or of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That which is of the self has no life; that which is of Christ has life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That which is of the self is dead; that which is of Christ is living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we understand this principle, we can easily distinguish the two when we touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, how can we distinguish between a real flower and an artificial flower when the two are the same color and shape?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This distinction lies in that one has no life, but the other has life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes we meet a saint who is full of love and diligence, yet all we sense is death; there is no supply of life and no anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we are loved by him, the more uncomfortable we feel; the more courtesy he extends toward us, the more uneasy we feel; the more diligence and kindness he shows toward us, the more we feel dry within, lacking any anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is because in his love, courtesy, and diligence there is no life; everything is out of himself and a part of his behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In another situation a person comes to rebuke us, and speaks a very strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although we may feel some pain, there is still the anointing within, and we can still touch God and be refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At such a moment we should know that this rebuke is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, the first content of the fullness is life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all know that the church is the fullness of Christ, but how do we know whether a particular church has the fullness?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we touch the anointing, freshness, and livingness in a locality, we should sense that the fullness, the church, is in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we can contact a group of fervent saints in a locality and not sense the fullness or any overflow of life among them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, in a Lord s table meeting two or three brothers pray so loudly that they can be heard by everyone, even without using a microphone; however, those with the sense of life will know that there is no life in their voice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even though their voice echoes throughout the meeting, it does not touch man s spirit, and there is no anointing in man s spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Consequently, even though the voice is loud and clear, very few people follow with Amens, and some even cannot say Amen because the prayer has no life; it is short of something living and lacks the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All of our activities, even our gospel preaching, should follow this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If what we do is out of ourselves, it is merely a behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We will not only feel dead within, but we will also not have the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If our person has been broken and Christ has been built into us, then what we do is of Christ and is the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first content, the first sign, of the fullness is life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We know that wherever we touch livingness, freshness, and the anointing, there is life; to touch life is to touch the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Gospel of John is a book on the fullness, and it presents life as the first content of the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord has come that man may have life 10:10 , and He is the life 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the fullness there is something called life, and this life is in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Life is real.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even though man cannot touch life, he cannot deny it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If someone dies, everyone notices immediately, because that person no longer has life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Life is real.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If life is present, it is present, and if it is absent, it is absent.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If it is, then it is, and if it is not, then it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we put two flowers side by side, people can readily recognize which one is real and which one is artificial because life is very real.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the church we should not look merely at the outward appearance; we need to touch the intrinsic content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, we need to touch the anointing and the life within; we need to touch the Lord s living presence.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the key to all questions, and it enables us to know whether a locality is the church in experience and whether it is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the fullness of Christ is present in a locality, life is also present.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the first content of the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>THE SECOND CONTENT OF THE FULLNESS RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life v. 25 . The Lord is not only life but also resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Undoubtedly, resurrection and life are related; without life there is no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, resurrection is one step further than life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although life is life, it is merely life and has not passed through testing, smiting, or death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, resurrection is life that has passed through testing, smiting, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>So life progressing is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Before life passes through death, life is merely life, but after life passes through death, it is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The life that is manifested after passing through death is called resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Please remember that the life, which is the first content of the fullness, is a life that can withstand death, a life that can be manifested even after death.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For example, the prayer of a brother may cause us to touch life, to sense the anointing, and to touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, our sense is sometimes mistaken, but there is another indicator of whether this is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If his prayer is of life, prayer will still come forth when he is tested or smitten.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Prayer that is of life never dies as a result of testing or smiting.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Whatever dies after testing and smiting is definitely not of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only what remains after testing and smiting is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A saint who serves in the church may be devoted and diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we sense the anointing and the presence of the Lord when we are with him, we may conclude that this must be of life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However, he may be stumbled and stop coming to the meetings if he receives a particular dealing from the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He may feel that the elders should not deal with him because he comes to serve the church; therefore, he withdraws.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This indicates that his diligence and devotion are not something in the fullness; it is without resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whatever is of resurrection can withstand testing, smiting, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Without passing through death, there is no strength, richness, and fullness; once something passes through death, it becomes strong, rich, and full.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>For two thousand years there has been a continual persecution and killing of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Persecution and killing can destroy only that which is not of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Anything that is of resurrection is able to pass through persecution and death.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Some conditions appear for a while in the church and then disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This shows that these conditions are not related to the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Only that which withstands trials and tests, endures dealings, becomes alive after death, and is manifested after breaking through the suppression of death is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In this situation of resurrection the fullness is here; resurrection is a sign of the fullness and a content of the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In the fullness there is not only life but also the life that has passed through death; this is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Anything that is able to stand is strengthened, made full, and enters into a higher level, even reaching a new realm after being tested, tried, suppressed, persecuted, and put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is resurrection, the strongest sign of the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The expression of a church should be resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If the Lord would have mercy on us and put us in trials, we would see how much is left of us after the trial of death.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Our bustling cannot withstand death, our excitement cannot withstand the smiting, and many of our virtues vanish completely once we pass through affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This proves that they are all out of ourselves and not of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This also proves that there is no expression of the church and no expression of the fullness of Christ.</S>
