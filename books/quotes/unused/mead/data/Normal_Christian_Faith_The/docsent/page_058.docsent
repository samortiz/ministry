   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT REFORMATION BUT REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Based on this realization, man begins to think of ways to change his mode of living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the purpose of so many religions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But can this be changed?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is true that man should be clean, courteous, and law-abiding and should be taught and cultivated in these virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But what is the purpose of this education and cultivation?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He may improve a little outwardly, but can he be changed inwardly?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We know perfectly well that the inward parts are impossible to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not setting up a debate with other religions; we are presenting only this characteristic!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A very crucial point in our faith is the matter of regeneration, not the matter of reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A CORRUPT LIFE WILL NOT EXHIBIT CLEAN LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our emphasis rests on this fact: not only is the expression of human living corrupt and sinful, but the life itself is corruption and man himself is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>People do not like to hear these kinds of words.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we can only speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man is basically wrong in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is corrupt in nature, and he sins as a result of this corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people admit their bad behavior but will not admit their corrupt self.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some admit the latter but do not realize that it is corrupt to the core.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man, being so corrupt, cannot naturally exhibit any clean living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One time when I was in Kaifeng, I talked to a person who admitted that he was wrong in one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After a while he confessed that he was wrong in another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I told him frankly that the problem was not whether he did one thing rightly or wrongly; the person was the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the person is wrong, surely the things he does will be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are a fish, surely you cannot fly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I cannot blame you for being unable to fly, because you are but a fish.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the man is not proper, the expression of living will not be proper either.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is entirely a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not merely a matter of an outward mode of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The human corruption is within him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>USELESS TO HAVE OUTWARD CORRECTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since man is corrupt within, there is no use in correcting him outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have a friend who came home from Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the train passed through Wushih, he bought a few dolls for his little daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All of the dolls were made of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They were painted and cutely decorated with bright colors.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His daughter was about seven years old.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When she got the toys she was overwhelmed with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Immediately she assumed the role of a mother, cuddling the dolls and putting them to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When it was time to eat, she fed them with food.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With her hands she shoveled the rice into the dolls' mouths, saying, "How come you don't eat?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Alas, the faces of the dolls were smeared with grease and rice!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The little girl, acting like her mother, began to wipe the faces with water and towels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Unfortunately, a black spot appeared when one part was wiped.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more she wiped, the bigger the black spot became.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After a while, the nose, eyes, and ears were all gone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She began to cry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There was nothing that could be done!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Her father said to her, "Throw them away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I will buy you new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Clay dolls cannot be washed."</S>
