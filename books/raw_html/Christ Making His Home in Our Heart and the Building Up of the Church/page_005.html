	 <h2 class="head1">ALL HUMAN BEINGS WHETHER GOOD OR BAD,<br />
NEEDING TO BE REGENERATED</h2>
<p>We should never think that only fallen men need to be born again, or that a person who is not fallen would not need to be born again. Even if man were not fallen, he would still need to be regenerated. Even the best man is only human; he does not possess the element of God. He has only man&rsquo;s life, not God&rsquo;s life. God ordained that His element and His life would enter into man so that God would be mingled with man. Therefore, whether a person is good or bad, he needs to be born again. Man needs God to enter into him to be his life. Besides the created life in him, man needs to obtain another life, the uncreated life.</p>
<p>Regeneration means that in addition to our life, we obtain another life, God&rsquo;s life, which is a second life, the eternal life, the highest life. How can a person obtain this life? After God created man, God placed man in front of the tree of life so that man would receive God as life. If man had received Him, God would have entered into man to be man&rsquo;s life. In other words, the life of the tree of life would have entered into man; the tree of life would have been planted into man. Thus, God would be in man, and man would have obtained the highest life.</p>
<p>I hope that this picture will be deeply etched into us: human beings need to have God&rsquo;s life. It is not that we are fallen and thus we need God&rsquo;s life. Even if man had not fallen, he would still have needed God&rsquo;s life. God&rsquo;s intention is to work Himself into us as our life. We should not have a religious concept and think that God wants us to worship Him and do things for Him. This is not God&rsquo;s intention. God has only one intention: He desires that we receive Him into us as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING CHRIST AS LIFE<br />
IN ORDER TO LIVE OUT THE HIGHEST LIVING</h2>
<p>In John 3 Nicodemus went to see the Lord Jesus. Nicodemus was a religionist who was full of religious concepts. He addressed the Lord as &ldquo;Rabbi,&rdquo; because he thought the Lord Jesus had &ldquo;come from God as a teacher&rdquo; (v. 2). A teacher teaches others. Nicodemus considered the Lord Jesus to be a teacher, who came for the sole purpose of teaching people in order to improve them and make them better persons. For example, if a brother loses his temper often, someone may come to teach him, and say, &ldquo;Do not lose your temper. You should speak with patience and have a good attitude, because God does not like people to get angry. Our anger does not fulfill God&rsquo;s righteousness. Blessed are those who are meek.&rdquo; To give this kind of advice is to teach. Let us use another example. Suppose a brother is narrow-hearted and often jealous of others. When the sisters are praised, he becomes angry. Someone may come to him and say, &ldquo;You should not be bothered when the sisters are praised, because brothers are different from sisters. The sisters have their heads covered, and the brothers have the headship. Hence, you should enlarge your heart.&rdquo; This is teaching. It is an attempt to improve the brother, to make him better.</p>
<p>A person with dirty clothes and messy hair can be given clean clothes and a comb, but this would improve only his outward appearance. This can be likened to the work done in a mortuary. People who work in a mortuary dress up dead people and make them look nice. The dead people in a mortuary may be dressed up and look nice, but they still have the appearance of death. They do not have a desirable appearance.</p>
<p>Those who are teachers can be likened to a mortician in a mortuary. If a person attempts to teach you in this way, you should say, &ldquo;Do not teach me in this way. Do not do the work of a mortician on me. Yes, I am dead, but the work of a mortician cannot help me. You may change my clothes, but I am still dead; you may put makeup on my face and wash me, but I am still dead. What I need is life. I do not need outward improvement.&rdquo; This is what the Lord Jesus revealed to Nicodemus. Nicodemus seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Lord, since You have come from God as a teacher, I have come to You to let You do the work of a mortician on me to change me, teach me, and improve me.&rdquo; However, the Lord Jesus replied, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 3). The Lord told Nicodemus that teaching and improvement availed nothing; Nicodemus needed to obtain another life. Without this other life, Nicodemus was in a different sphere, a different realm, and a different kingdom. God&rsquo;s kingdom is God&rsquo;s sphere, God&rsquo;s realm. Without obtaining God&rsquo;s life, Nicodemus could not understand the things in God&rsquo;s sphere, God&rsquo;s kingdom. He needed to obtain God as his life.</p>
<p>Similarly, we need to have God&rsquo;s life, not only our human life. Do not think that we are asking you to join a religion. Please remember that all the work in religion is the same as the work done in a mortuary. If anyone attempts to teach us, telling us to be patient and meek and to have good behavior, we should tell him not to do the work of a mortician on us. We do not need any dead work. We need to have God&rsquo;s life within. We need to eat the tree of life and receive its fruit into us. This is regeneration. Only when a man receives Christ as his life can he live out the highest living.</p>
