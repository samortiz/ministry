   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REVELATION OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING TO LIVE THROUGH DYING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, the divine thought of the Bible is greatly different from human philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way of deliverance revealed by the Bible is not suffering, but death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not suffering which delivers man, but death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 6:7 says, For he who has died is justified from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although suffering can restrain man and keep him from sin, it can deliver him only to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, those who suffer are not necessarily free from sin; sometimes they may sin even more.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, suffering cannot actually deliver man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What saves and delivers man from sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is God s way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This way is not through suffering, but through death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Catholicism has subtly changed the meaning of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a book among the Catholics called The Imitation of Christ which teaches people to bear the cross and to apply the suffering of the cross as an element of asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, those from the inner life group had similar thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Madame Guyon once said that the cross is something to be loved, and that she desired to embrace and kiss the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even in the early years I had felt that this kind of speaking could lead to improper impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, forty years ago I wrote a hymn especially to clear up the confusion caused by Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The hymn Hymns, #622 says:</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we take up the cross, will we but suffer pain?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nay, if we bear the cross, be sure that we will die!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The meaning of the cross is that we may be slain;</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The cross experienced the self will crucify.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Divine deliverance e er slays man by the cross;</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Though cruel it may seem, it is a grand release.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ ne er will be our life if we escape the cross;</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ ne er will be expressed but by our sure decease.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The cross s final goal, that God s will be fulfilled;</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His will s arch enemy is but the self of man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If self be done away and all the soul-life killed,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s will shall then prevail and prospered be His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christianity has followed Catholicism in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Christianity, speakings on the cross generally emphasize suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To many, bearing the cross means to suffer for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, this is not the revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The cross mentioned in the Bible emphasizes the termination and the putting to death of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>LIVING THROUGH DYING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>BEING GOD S WAY OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Living through dying is the basic thought of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For one to live, he must die.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brother A. B. Simpson also said in one of his hymns, This the secret nature hideth, harvest grows from buried grain Hymns, #482 . This shows us that the biblical principle is living through dying.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s way of salvation is to terminate us by the cross of Christ and to resurrect us by His Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This appears to be a cruel punishment, but actually it is a glorious deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Based on the revelation of the whole Bible, we see clearly that living through dying is God s saving way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first ministry in the New Testament is that of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He came out to preach the baptism of repentance and immersed and buried men into the water, which signifies death, in order to terminate the man of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Following that, there was the ministry of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His ministry caused the terminated ones to have a new beginning, to resurrect from the dead, and to obtain the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This adequately proves that in the salvation of God s New Testament economy, there is a fundamental thought and principle, which is that fallen man can receive life only through death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Death is the initiation into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have a hymn Hymns, #631 which speaks very well concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If I d know Christ s risen power,</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I must ever love the Cross;</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Life from death alone arises;</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There s no gain except by loss.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If no death, no life,</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If no death, no life;</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Life from death alone arises;</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If no death, no life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If I d have Christ formed within me,</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I must breathe my final breath,</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Live within the Cross s shadow,</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Put my soul-life e er to death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If God thru th Eternal Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nail me ever with the Lord;</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only then as death is working</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Will His life thru me be poured.</S>
