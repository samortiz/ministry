   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF TITUS MESSAGE ONE ESTABLISHING THE AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Titus 1:1-9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is helpful to know the sequence in which the four books of 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon were written.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philemon was written first, during Paul's first Roman imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After his release from prison, Paul wrote 1 Timothy and the Epistle to Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Finally, during his second imprisonment, at the time of Nero's persecution, he wrote his last epistle, the Epistle of 2 Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOK: THE MAINTENANCE OF THE ORDER OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The subject of the book of Titus is the maintenance of the order of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During Paul's first imprisonment in Rome, the churches were subject to testing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During this time of testing, certain churches proved not to be so orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, after his release from prison, Paul visited various places, including the city of Ephesus and the island of Crete.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Realizing the situation of the churches, Paul became burdened to write an epistle to Titus telling him how to maintain the proper order of a local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was the background and also the reason for the writing of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the order of the church is to be maintained, the authority in the church needs to be established.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, in this message we shall consider from 1:1-9 the establishing of the authority in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we shall see, this has much to do with appointing elders in each city v. 5 . II.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>INTRODUCTION A. Paul, a Slave of God and an Apostle of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us first consider 1:1-9 verse by verse and then consider in more detail certain crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Titus 1:1 says, "Paul, a slave of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's chosen ones, and the full knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul was an apostle according to four things: the command of God 1 Tim 1:1 , the faith of God's chosen ones, the promise of life 2 Tim 1:1 , and the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Command is on God's side, speaking for Him and requiring something of us for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Faith is on our side, responding to God's requirements and receiving His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a proclamation that we are unable to fulfill God's requirements, but that God has done everything for us and that we receive what He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The life promised by God is what we have received of Him for the carrying out of His demand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was in this way that Paul was an apostle to administrate God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1:1 Paul refers to God's chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This denotes the believers in Christ, who were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world Eph 1:4 and selected from mankind for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul was an apostle not only according to the faith of God's chosen ones, but also according to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Faith is to receive all God has planned for us, all God has done for us, and all God has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Full knowledge of the truth is a thorough apprehension of the truth, a full acknowledgment and appreciation of the reality of all the spiritual and divine things which we have received through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Apostleship is according to such an apprehension and appreciation of the reality of God's eternal economy.</S>
