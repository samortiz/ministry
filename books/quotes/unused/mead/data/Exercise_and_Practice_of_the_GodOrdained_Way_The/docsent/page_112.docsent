   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORMING THE NEW BELIEVERS INTO GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In forming the new believers into groups, you do not need to wait until you have eight or nine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You could form a group meeting with just one newly baptized believer and one or two other visiting ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then, gradually, the group meeting will grow until it reaches a size large enough to subdivide.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No group meeting should remain for over a year without subdividing, so each year the group meetings should double.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By this way, the church will grow and expand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we labor in this way, we will discover a lot of details that will help us to grow and improve our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Within three to five years a good foundation for growth and expansion will be laid in all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>HOME MEETINGS DEVELOPING INTO GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we take care of the new ones, we must learn to do two things at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While we are in the homes of the new ones to feed them, we are also there endeavoring to bring them into the realization and practice of a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The home meeting is mainly to cherish, nourish, and to feed the new ones a little bit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the group meeting has other elements, such as fellowship, intercession, care, shepherding, and mutual teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we are with them, we should try to add these elements of the group meeting into the home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When these elements are brought into the meeting, the home meeting changes into a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But this does not mean that the home meeting with cherishing, nourishing, and feeding should be abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We still should care for the new ones in the principle of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But as we are laboring in the home meetings, we should also labor to build up the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, a group meeting will also meet the need of feeding the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The group meeting is really a miniature of the church life because it comprises the elements of fellowship, intercession, mutual care, shepherding, and mutual teaching, as well as gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>LABORING IN A NEW PLACE VERSUS LABORING IN AN OLD PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If my wife and I with four other brothers and their families went to an absolutely new place like Mongolia, I believe that in a single year, we could gain at least thirty new believers through the practice of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This could be done mainly because the Mongolians would not have any idea about the practice of Christianity, and we would not bring anything of it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We would simply preach the gospel to them, baptize them, and meet with them in the home meetings and small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We would be absolutely new and keep anything of the oldness of Christianity away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without the frustration of opinions and oldness, perhaps as many as five hundred could be gained in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Due to the frustrations of differing opinions, the result of the practice of the new way has been greatly reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of the different opinions and attacks, as we labor according to the God-ordained way, we must build with one hand and fight the enemy with the other as Nehemiah did in rebuilding the walls of the city of Jerusalem Neh 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes, only a small part of our strength can be applied to the positive work of carrying out the Lord's move, and a greater part of our strength must be used to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the nature of the work in an old place.</S>
