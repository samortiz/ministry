<h1 class="title">The Word of God and the Testimony of Jesus</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:1-2, 9; 6:9; 12:17;<br />
19:10, 13; 20:4</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The book of Revelation presents to us the revealed Christ and the testifying church&mdash; 1:1-2, 9; 6:9; 12:17; 20:4; 19:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ as the Word of God is the testimony of God, the Witness of God, the definition, explanation, and expression of the mysterious and invisible God, the One who reveals God to us&mdash;John 1:1, 14, 18; Rev. 1:5; cf. Exo. 25:21-22.</li>
	<li>The church as the Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem, is the testimony, the expression, of Christ; as such, the church is the reproduction of the testimony, the expression, of God in Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; Rev. 21:2-3; cf. Exo. 38:21.</li>
	<li>Our enjoyment of the revealed Christ as the testimony of God constitutes us into His testimony, which is the present revelation of Jesus Christ&mdash; 1 Tim. 3:15-16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as the Word of God is in three forms&mdash; the person of Christ Himself, the spoken word, and the written word&mdash;John 1:1; 5:39-40; 6:63:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ as the testimony of God and the living word of God infuses His substance into His loving seekers, working Himself into them to make them His enlarged and expanded testimony:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Through the Word we can enjoy God&rsquo;s countenance and the shining of His face so that we can glow with Him for His glory&mdash;Exo. 34:28-29; 2 Cor. 3:16, 18; Psa. 27:4, 8; Psa. 119:58, 135.</li>
		<li>By pray-reading the Word, we breathe God&rsquo;s element into us, being infused with what God is to cause us to live Christ and become the living expression of God&mdash;2 Tim. 3:16-17; Eph. 6:17-18.</li>
		<li>We need to let the word of Christ inhabit us richly, singing His word, so that His word may enlighten us, nourish us, quench our thirst, strengthen us, wash us, build us up, perfect us, edify us, and fill us with joy&mdash;Col. 3:16; Psa. 119:54; cf. 1 Kings 6:7; 1 Chron. 6:31-32.</li>
		<li>Our life as believers hinges totally upon the Lord&rsquo;s speaking&mdash;His instant, present, living word to sanctify us, preparing us to be His glorious bride&mdash;Eph. 5:25-27; cf. S. S. 6:13; 8:13-14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ as the Word of God is the Warrior of God with His bridal army as His testimony to execute God&rsquo;s judgment upon the man of lawlessness and the armies who follow him by the sharp sword, the almighty word that proceeds out of His mouth&mdash;Rev. 19:13, 15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Christ, who is the Word of God, is the word which will judge the rebellious&mdash;vv. 15, 21; John 12:48.</li>
		<li>His fighting is the speaking of God&rsquo;s word; as the Lord fights, He speaks for God and expresses God&mdash;Rev. 2:16.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus as the Word of God will slay the man of lawlessness by the breath of His mouth and bring him to nothing by the manifestation of His coming&mdash;2 Thes. 2:3-8; 1 John 3:4.</li>
		<li>In this age we need to receive the word as the Spirit, which then becomes a sword to slay the adversary within us, applying Ephesians 6:17-18 in an experiential way:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Without the word as the Spirit to be the killing sword, there is no way for us to be kept in the church life and in the ministry.</li>
			<li>The word that we receive in a living way as the Spirit is a spiritual antibiotic that kills the &ldquo;germs&rdquo; within us so that the evil forces in the air have no way to take advantage of us.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ as the living word infuses us with God&rsquo;s substance, and Christ as the slaying word kills the adversary within us to make us His overcoming testimony for the accomplishment of His eternal economy, the fulfillment of His original intention&mdash;Gen. 1:26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The testimony of Jesus is the spirit&mdash;the reality, substance, disposition, and characteristic&mdash; of the prophecy of the book of Revelation&mdash;Rev. 19:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The testimony of Jesus is the seven golden lampstands as the shining churches&mdash;divine in nature, shining in darkness, and identical with one another&mdash;1:11-20.</li>
	<li>The testimony of Jesus is the great multitude serving God in the temple, the whole Body of God&rsquo;s redeemed, who have been raptured to the heavens to enjoy God&rsquo;s care and the Lamb&rsquo;s shepherding&mdash;7:9-17.</li>
	<li>The testimony of Jesus is the bright woman, representing the whole Body of God&rsquo;s redeemed, with her man-child, representing the overcomers as the stronger part of God&rsquo;s people&mdash;12:1-17.</li>
	<li>The testimony of Jesus is the firstfruits, signifying the overcomers raptured before the great tribulation, and the harvest, signifying the majority of the believers who will be raptured at the end of the great tribulation&mdash;14:1-5, 14-16.</li>
	<li>The testimony of Jesus is the victorious ones standing on the glassy sea, signifying the late overcomers who will pass through the great tribulation and overcome Antichrist and the worshipping of Antichrist&mdash;15:2-4.</li>
	<li>The testimony of Jesus is the bride ready for marriage, consisting of the overcoming saints during the millennium&mdash;19:7-9.</li>
	<li>The testimony of Jesus is the bridal army to fight along with Christ, the embodiment of God, and defeat the Antichrist, the embodiment of Satan, with his armies&mdash;vv. 14-19; 17:14.</li>
	<li>Ultimately, the testimony of Jesus is the New Jerusalem, the great universal, divine-human incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite people (Rev. 21:2-3, 22; cf. Exo. 38:21) and the unique lampstand as the consummation of all the lampstands for the consummate expression of God (Rev. 21:18, 23; 22:5).</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol><h1 class="msg">Message Three</h1>
<h1 class="title">The Triune God and the Divine Trinity</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:4-5; 22:17a; 4:5; 5:6</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Triune God mainly refers to God Himself, the divine Person; the Divine Trinity mainly refers to God&rsquo;s being triune, which is the primary attribute of the Godhead&mdash;Matt. 28:19; Rev. 1:4-5.</li>
<li>The Trinity in Revelation is the economical Trinity&mdash;1:4-5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The essential Trinity refers to the essence of the Triune God for His existence; the economical Trinity refers to God&rsquo;s plan for His move&mdash;Matt. 28:19; Rev. 1:4-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the essential Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist and coinhere at the same time and in the same way with no succession.</li>
		<li>In the economical Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit work in three successive steps, or stages, in the process of God&rsquo;s economy:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Father planned, the Son accomplished, and the Spirit applies what the Son accomplished according to the Father&rsquo;s plan&mdash;Eph. 1:4-5, 7, 13.</li>
			<li>While the divine economy is being carried out, the eternal coexistence and coinherence of the three in the Godhead remain intact and are not jeopardized.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Trinity in Matthew 28:19 is the Trinity of God&rsquo;s existence&mdash;the essential Trinity&mdash;but the Trinity in Revelation 1:4-5 is the Trinity in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;the economical Trinity:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Revelation we see the administration, the government, the activity, the move, the act, and the work of the Trinity&mdash;4:5; 5:6.</li>
		<li>In God&rsquo;s essence the Trinity is simply the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but in God&rsquo;s economy the Trinity is complicated:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Father is the One &ldquo;who is and who was and who is coming&rdquo;&mdash;1:4b.</li>
			<li>The Spirit is &ldquo;the seven Spirits who are before His throne&rdquo;&mdash;v. 4c.</li>
			<li>The Son is &ldquo;Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth&rdquo;&mdash;v. 5a.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Triune God in Revelation is the processed and consummated Triune God&mdash;22:17a; 3:22; 14:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The God in Genesis 1 is the unprocessed God, but the God in Revelation is the processed and consummated Triune God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Processed</em> refers to the crucial steps through which the Triune God has passed in the divine economy, and <em>consummated</em> indicates that the process has been completed.</li>
		<li>Before His incarnation God was unprocessed, having the divine nature but not the human nature, but through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, the Triune God was processed and consummated.</li>
		<li>In Revelation the Triune God is the processed and consummated Triune God with divinity, humanity, human living, the all-inclusive death, the powerful resurrection, and the transcendent ascension&mdash;1:4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The processed and consummated Triune God is <em>the Spirit</em>&mdash;Rev. 22:17a; John 7:39:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit is the totality, the aggregate, of all the elements of the titles of the Spirit of God&mdash;Luke 1:35; Matt. 3:16; 10:20; Luke 4:18; Gal. 4:6; Acts 16:7; Rom. 8:9; Phil. 1:19.</li>
		<li>As the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, the Spirit is the blessing of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash; Gal. 3:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Triune God in Revelation is the sevenfold intensified Spirit&mdash;3:1; 4:5; 5:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because of the degradation of the church, the Spirit has been intensified sevenfold to become the sevenfold intensified Spirit&mdash;1:4.</li>
	<li>The sevenfold intensified Spirit intensifies all the elements of the Spirit&mdash;3:1.</li>
	<li>The sevenfold intensified Spirit is for God&rsquo;s move to carry out His administration&mdash;4:5; 5:6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Triune God in Revelation is the building and builded God&mdash;21:18-19a, 21a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Bible consummates in the New Jerusalem, which is the very God who was in the beginning&mdash;Gen. 1:1; Rev. 21:2, 10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The unique God is eventually enlarged and expanded into a city for His eternal expression&mdash;Gen. 1:1; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		<li>In His economy God has become the New Jerusalem&mdash;21:10.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem is the Triune God wrought into His redeemed&mdash;21:18-19a, 21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The God who has become the New Jerusalem is the building and builded God&mdash;2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Matt. 16:18; Eph. 3:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The processed and consummated Triune God as the source, the element, and the essence is building the church by building Himself into our being&mdash;Eph. 3:17.</li>
		<li>God is fulfilling His desire to build Himself in Christ into our being and to build us into His being; eventually, the outcome of this building will be the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the book of Revelation, we have the consummate revelation of the Divine Trinity for the divine dispensing&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 22:1-2; 7:17a; 21:6b; John 4:14b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The divine dispensing is God&rsquo;s imparting of Himself into His chosen and redeemed people as their life, their life supply, and their everything&mdash; 2 Cor. 13:14.</li>
	<li>In the divine dispensing, the Father is the fountain, the Son is the spring, and the Spirit is the flow&mdash;Jer. 2:13; John 4:10, 14; 7:37-39; Rev. 22:1; 7:17a; 21:6b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the origin the Father is the fountain of living waters&mdash;Jer. 2:13.</li>
		<li>As the embodiment and expression of the Father, the Son is the spring, the emergence of the fountain&mdash;John 4:14.</li>
		<li>As the transmission the Spirit is the river&mdash; Rev. 22:1.</li>
		<li>This is the Divine Trinity in the divine dispensing&mdash;God the Father as the source, God the Son as the course, and God the Spirit as the flow.</li>

		<li>Mixture in our Christian life brings in darkness, but when our Christian life is purified through the divine nature, we have light&mdash; cf. Deut. 22:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The lampstand is of beaten work, signifying sufferings&mdash;Exo. 25:31:

			<li>Christ as the resurrection life is growing, branching, budding, and blossoming in us, by us, and with us to shine the light&mdash;Col. 2:19.</li>

			</ol></li>
		<li>As those who believe in Christ, we are a part of this wonderful golden tree in resurrection and with the divine nature, life, the Spirit, and the shining light.</li>

		<li>The lover of Christ overcomes the old creation by living in ascension&mdash;4:8.</li>
		<li>The lover of Christ overcomes the flesh, the natural man, the old man, by living within the veil&mdash;6:4a.</li>

	<li>Overcoming as presented in 1 John:

		<li>The believers overcome the world through faith in the Son of God&mdash;5:4-5.</li>
		<li>The strong believers overcome the evil one by being nourished, strengthened, and sustained by the word of God&mdash;2:13-14.</li>
		<li>The believers overcome the antichrists through the indwelling Christ&mdash;4:3-4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Overcoming as unveiled in Revelation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The overcoming in 21:7 qualifies all believers for participation in the New Jerusalem with all its enjoyment as a common portion of God&rsquo;s eternal salvation.</li>
		<li>The overcoming in chapters two and three qualifies the overcoming believers for participation in the enjoyment of the millennial kingdom as a particular reward in God&rsquo;s dispensational administration.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The book of Revelation is a book on the overcomers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although Revelation is a book on prophecy, the central purpose of this book is concerned not with prophecy but with the overcomers&mdash;1:3; 22:18-19; 12:11.</li>
	<li>Revelation shows us the overcomers in five categories:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first category consists of the martyrs of the Old Testament and the New Testament up to the time before the great tribulation&mdash; 6:9-11.</li>
		<li>The second category is the man-child caught up to God and to His throne&mdash;12:5.</li>
		<li>The third category is the firstfruits&mdash;14:1-5.</li>
		<li>The fourth category is composed of those standing on the glassy sea, the overcomers who are killed under the persecution of Antichrist&mdash;15:2-4.</li>
		<li>These four categories constitute the fifth category&mdash;the prepared bride&mdash;19:7-9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is the totality of the overcomers:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The overcomers will be the New Jerusalem in the coming age, the age of the millennial kingdom, as the precursor of the New Jerusalem&mdash; 2:7; 3:12.</li>
		<li>In the New Jerusalem in eternity, all the believers will be overcomers&mdash;21:7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the book of Revelation what the Lord wants and what the Lord will build up is Zion, the overcomers&mdash;14:1.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord needs the overcomers to conquer the destructive satanic chaos and to triumph in the unique constructive divine economy&mdash; 1 Tim. 1:4; Rev. 12:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Alongside God&rsquo;s economy, there has been the satanic chaos, which has resulted in three accu- mulations: Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism&mdash;a threefold chaos&mdash;2:9; 3:9; 2:20; 3:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the eyes of the Lord, these three &ldquo;isms&rdquo; are more evil than sin, the world, and the self.</li>
		<li>The overcomers conquer everything of Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism&mdash;2:14-15, 20, 24; 3:1-2, 9.</li>

		<li>The overcomers are for the building up of the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 4:16; Rev. 21:2, 10.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>In Revelation 2 and 3 the Lord has a sevenfold calling for overcomers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the epistle to the church in Ephesus, to overcome is to recover the first love toward the Lord and to hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans&mdash;2:4-6.</li>
	<li>In the epistle to the church in Smyrna, to overcome is to overcome persecution by being faithful unto death&mdash;v. 10.</li>
	<li>In the epistle to Pergamos, to overcome is to overcome the church&rsquo;s union with the world, the teaching of idolatry and fornication, and the teaching of hierarchy&mdash;vv. 12-15.</li>
	<li>In the epistle to Thyatira, to overcome is to overcome Roman Catholicism&mdash;vv. 20, 24.</li>
	<li>In the epistle to Sardis, to overcome is to overcome dead Protestantism&mdash;3:1.</li>
	<li>In the epistle to Philadelphia, to overcome is to hold fast what we have in the recovered church&mdash; v. 11.</li>
	<li>In the epistle to Laodicea, to overcome is to overcome the lukewarmness and pride of the degraded recovered church, to pay the price to buy the needed items, and to open the door so that the Lord can come in&mdash;vv. 15-20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The overcomers are produced through the intensification of God&rsquo;s organic salvation by the sevenfold intensified Spirit, that is, by Christ in the stage of His intensification&mdash;1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6.</li>

<li>The Lord&rsquo;s promises at the end of each of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 refer both to the present enjoyment of the overcomers and the reward to them in the coming millennial kingdom:

		<li>To those who watch and wait for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, He will appear to them privately as the morning star&mdash;cf. Mal. 4:2.</li>

		<li>Apparently the throne is invisible and is not realized by man, but actually it is behind the scene ruling over everyone and everything&mdash; Isa. 6:1.</li>
		<li>Everything in today&rsquo;s world situation is decided on the throne; no one can do anything and nothing can happen outside the rule of God&rsquo;s throne.</li>

	<li>The throne of God is not only for God to reign but also for God to accomplish His eternal purpose&mdash;Eph. 1:9, 11; 3:11; Rom. 8:28; Rev. 4:11:

		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the Lion He is the Fighter against the enemy, Satan; as the Lamb He is the Redeemer for us&mdash;Gen. 49:9; John 1:29.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>We need to be in our spirit so that we can be men on earth with God&rsquo;s heart, men to whom heaven can be opened to see the vision of God concerning the destiny of the world&mdash;Rev. 1:10; 4:1-2; cf. Gen. 28:12-17; Ezek. 1:1; Matt. 3:16; Acts 7:56; 10:11; Rev. 19:11.</li>
<li>The first four seals opened by the Lamb-God show us that immediately after His ascension (Mark 16:19-20) there has been a four-horse race continuing through the entire age of the church until Christ&rsquo;s return:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first seal consists of a white horse and its rider, signifying the spreading of the gospel&mdash; Rev. 6:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The bow without an arrow signifies that Christ&rsquo;s fighting for the constitution of the gospel of peace is finished and the victory is won.</li>
		<li>A crown signifies that the gospel has been crowned with the glory of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 4:4.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Went forth conquering&rdquo; signifies that the gospel has been going forth with Christ to conquer all kinds of opposition and attack&mdash;Rev. 6:2.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s unique purpose in this age is to have the gospel preached that the church as the Body of Christ might be built up to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 3:8-11; Rom. 1:1.</li>
		<li>The overcomers who preach the gospel of the glory of Christ become the riders of the white horse&mdash;Rev. 19:11, 13-14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The second seal consists of a red horse and its rider, signifying the spreading of war&mdash;6:3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Red signifies the shedding of blood.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;A great sword&rdquo; signifies weapons for fighting.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;To take peace from the earth&rdquo; signifies that war is continuing on the earth.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;That men should slay one another&rdquo; signifies that people will fight one another&mdash;v. 4; Matt. 24:7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The third seal consists of a black horse and its rider, signifying the spreading of famine&mdash;Rev. 6:5-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A balance, a scale used to weigh precious things, being used here to weigh food, signifies the scarcity of food.</li>
		<li>A quart of wheat, good pay for a day&rsquo;s labor, and three quarts of barley, also good pay for a day&rsquo;s labor (Matt. 20:2), signify the high price of food in its scarcity.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Do not harm the oil and the wine&rdquo; (oil and wine are for man&rsquo;s pleasure&mdash;Psa. 104:15&mdash; and are always short in supply and become precious in famine) signifies the presence of famine.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The fourth seal consists of a pale horse and its rider, signifying the spreading of death&mdash;Rev. 6:7-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Pale signifies the color of the appearance of those stricken with the plague.</li>
		<li>Hades following Death signifies that Hades receives and retains those whom death has killed.</li>
		<li>Authority is given to Death and Hades over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword, famine, and pestilence, and by the beasts of the earth.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>The fifth seal consists of the prayer of the martyred saints, including the martyrs of the Old Testament, from Paradise for their avenging&mdash; Rev. 6:9-11; Matt. 23:34-36:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The martyrdom of the saints is because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus&mdash;Rev. 1:9; 12:17; 20:4:
		<ol class="decimal">

		<li>The martyrs of Christ can be martyrs physically, psychologically, or spiritually&mdash;2 Tim. 4:6; Rev. 12:11b; 1 Cor. 16:12.</li>
		<li>We need to live a martyr&rsquo;s life by dying to our human life to live the divine life, being conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection for the reality of His Body&mdash; Gal. 6:17; Phil. 3:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The prayer of the martyred saints, which should take place near the end of this age, is also mentioned in Revelation 8:3-5 and Luke 18:7-8:

		<li>The prayers of the saints in Revelation 8:3-4 are for the judgment of the earth, which opposes God&rsquo;s economy.</li>

			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In this parable the righteous God is likened to an unrighteous judge, and the believers in Christ are likened to a widow&mdash;vv. 2, 6, 3:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) In a sense, the believers in Christ are a widow in the present age because their Husband, Christ (2 Cor. 11:2), is absent from them&mdash;cf. Rev. 18:7.</li>
				<li>2) Although God does not seem to do anything on behalf of His persecuted people, we must learn to be a bothering widow, one who prays to God persistently&mdash;Luke 18:4-5; Isa. 62:6.</li>
				<li>3) By faith the martyrs experienced God&rsquo;s peaceful silence, exercising faith in God even when He did nothing to deliver them&mdash;Heb. 11:32-38; Matt. 11:6.</li>
				<li>4) We ought to pray persistently that God will avenge us of our enemy, Satan the devil, and should not lose heart.</li>
				<li>5) God&rsquo;s avenging us of our enemy will take place at the Savior&rsquo;s coming back&mdash;2 Thes. 2:6-9.</li>
				<li>6) Immediately following the sixth seal is the seventh seal as an answer to the prayer of the martyred saints&mdash;Rev. 6:12-17; 8:1-2.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The persistent faith for persistent prayer is the divine requirement for the overcomers to meet Christ in His triumphant return&mdash;Luke 18:8.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In His work in the divine administration, Christ is another Angel&mdash;7:2; 8:3; 10:1; 18:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is called &ldquo;another Angel&rdquo; because He stands on the position of one who has been sent by God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the Old Testament Christ was called the Angel of the Lord&mdash;Gen. 22:11-12; Exo. 3:2-6; Judg. 6:11-24; Zech. 1:11-12; 2:8-11; 3:1-7.</li>
		<li>In the book of Revelation He is called &ldquo;another Angel,&rdquo; the unique, special Angel, because He is the One sent by God to carry out His economy&mdash;7:2; 8:3; 10:1, 5, 9; 18:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As another Angel Christ takes care of God&rsquo;s people, both the sons of Israel and the believers:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In 7:2-8 He takes care of the chosen remnant of Israel and is unveiled as another Angel in relation to &ldquo;a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel&rdquo;&mdash;v. 4.</li>
		<li>In His work as another Angel, Christ takes care of the believers, the redeemed saints of the church, preserving them throughout all the tribulations&mdash;vv. 9-17.</li>
		<li>Christ as God&rsquo;s Angel controls the whole universe, directing the other angels to carry out God&rsquo;s judgment upon the earth&mdash;vv. 2-3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In 8:3-5 Christ as another Angel executes God&rsquo;s administration over the earth by ministering to God as the High Priest with the prayers of His saints:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The incense altar (golden altar) is the executing center of God&rsquo;s administration&mdash;v. 3.</li>
		<li>The golden censer signifies the prayers of the saints (5:8), and the incense signifies Christ with all His merit added to the saints&rsquo; prayers.</li>
		<li>When the prayers of the saints ascend to God with the incense of Christ, God carries out His administration&mdash;8:5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God&rsquo;s administration needs the saints&rsquo; prayers, which are their response to Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry.</li>
			<li>As we pray He administrates, and as He administrates we pray.</li>
			<li>Christ first offers our prayers to God and then pours out God&rsquo;s answers.</li>
			<li>The pouring out of God&rsquo;s answers to our prayers equals God&rsquo;s universal administration.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In 10:1-2 Christ comes as another Angel to take possession of the sea and the land:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>His having one foot on the sea and the other on the land signifies that He is coming to take possession of the whole earth&mdash;v. 2b.</li>
		<li>Although the earth and the sea have been usurped by God&rsquo;s enemy, one day Christ will no longer tolerate this usurpation, and He will come to claim His rightful inheritance&mdash;Psa. 2:8; 24:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In His work as another Angel Christ will come to declare God&rsquo;s judgment over Babylon the Great and to appear in glory to make the whole earth the kingdom of God&mdash;18:1-2; 11:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The seventh trumpet, as the conclusion of the eternal economy of the processed Triune God, closes the present age of mystery; hence, Revelation 10:7 says, &ldquo;The mystery of God is finished&rdquo;:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Daniel 9:24 speaks of the seventy weeks, which were apportioned to &ldquo;seal up vision and prophet&rdquo;:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To seal up vision and prophet is to close the age of mystery (the age of the church), that is, to finish the mystery of God.</li>
		<li>The vision and prophet will be sealed because everything will be fulfilled:

			<li>There will be no further need of vision and prophet.</li>
			<li>In the kingdom age, there will be kings and priests but no prophets.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the dispensations from Adam to Moses and from Moses to Christ, everything was unveiled, manifested, and there was no mystery; also in the dispensation of the millennial kingdom everything will be unveiled, and there will be no more mystery.</li>
	<li>In the dispensation from Christ to the millennial kingdom&mdash;the church age, the age of grace&mdash; everything is a mystery:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The incarnation of Christ, as the beginning of the dispensation of mystery, is a mystery&mdash; 1 Tim. 3:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Through the incarnation of Christ, the infinite God was brought into the finite man.</li>
			<li>The entire God, not God the Son only, was incarnated; hence, Christ in incarnation is the entire God manifested in the flesh.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ is the mystery of God&mdash;Col. 2:2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God.</li>
			<li>As the mystery of God, Christ is the embodiment, definition, and explanation of God; all that God intends to do is related to Christ.</li>
			<li>In Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; that is, the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Christ in a bodily form&mdash;v. 9.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The church is the mystery of Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:4-6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ is a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ.</li>
			<li>This mystery is God&rsquo;s economy, which is to dispense Christ, as the embodiment of God, into God&rsquo;s chosen people in order to produce a Body to be the increase of God&rsquo;s embodiment in Christ, that God may have a corporate expression.</li>
			<li>Christ and the church as one spirit are the great mystery&mdash;5:32.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 13:11), the gospel (Eph. 6:19), the indwelling of Christ (Col. 1:27), and the resurrection and transfiguration of the saints as the ending of the dispensation of mystery are also mysteries.</li>

<li>The kingdom of God is Christ Himself&mdash;Luke 17:21; Matt. 12:28:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Triune God in humanity (Col. 2:9) is the seed, the gene, of the kingdom of God to be sown into God&rsquo;s chosen people that He might grow in them, live in them, and be expressed from within them to develop into God&rsquo;s ruling realm&mdash;Mark 4:26-29; 1 Cor. 3:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The intrinsic element of the entire teaching of the New Testament is that the Triune God has been incarnated in order to be sown into His chosen people and develop within them into a kingdom.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s goal is the full development of the kingdom of God:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the Gospels we have the sowing of the seed, the gene, of the kingdom&mdash;Mark 4:3, 14; Matt. 9:35.</li>

		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to be rewarded by the Lord to reign with Him in His thousand-year kingdom (Rev. 11:18), we need to be saved from the degradation of the church to be His overcomers:
