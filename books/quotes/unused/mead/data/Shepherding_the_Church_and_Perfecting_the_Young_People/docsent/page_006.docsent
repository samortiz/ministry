   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVERYONE IN THE SMALL GROUP BEARING RESPONSIBILITY AND SERVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the small groups we should introduce the saints to spiritual books for their study and encourage them to fellowship mutually in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A small group can use one evening to read spiritual books and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>About ten saints can gather together and use half the time to read and the other half to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A group can use two evenings to visit saints or preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we can practice this consistently, over a period of time we will see results.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The information concerning gospel friends does not have to be taken care of in a central location.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This information should be taken care of by the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also need to consider certain matters such as baptisms.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such matters do not necessarily need to be done in the halls.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Baptisms can be taken care of by the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A small group can baptize its gospel friends who have received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way the church life is simplified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should make a new list of the saints who are in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Based on this list saints can be formed into groups.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not designate one saint as the responsible one, because every saint is a responsible one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even if twenty saints come together, every saint is responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These saints should take care of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They can preach the gospel together and edify one another; all the saints should be responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because there seems to be a hint of bureaucracy among us, no one should be assigned to be a leading one in a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every saint should take the lead and take care of the group.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the saints do not take care of themselves, they will die.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need an atmosphere of mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must not let the districts administrate the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such an administration would annul the function of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we try to administrate, the more problems there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should eliminate any administration through the districts by letting the saints serve and take care of their activities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the saints meet on the Lord s Day morning, it is the responsibility of the elders, the fathers and mothers, to give them something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not control the saints; instead, feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The districts should not seek to control the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The oversight of the elders in the districts is a sufficient responsibility for the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The administration in a district must be reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In a local church the responsibility of the elders is mainly in feeding and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the saints gather together on the Lord s Day morning, the elders should give them food.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The genuine administrative responsibility of the elders is to give food to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If people are fed, there will be no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This principle also applies to the administration of a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a nation is fed and satisfied, there will be no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, we must feed and satisfy the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the saints are not fed, our administration will bring in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the saints are fed, our administration will bring in order.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>SETTING THE SPIRITS OF THE SAINTS FREE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A hall that stresses only administration of outward matters is like a cake not turned Hosea 7:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some may think that it is a risk to reduce the administrative involvement of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to run this risk and see what happens.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not feel a need to direct every matter in a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This will enable the function of the saints to be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the saints in a small group are quarreling, we should not be quick to intervene with their quarreling.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a small group becomes desolate because of incessant quarreling, let it be so.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, the Lord will open a door for the consecrated saints to address the real need of the group, and the quarreling will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps I am too much in my speaking, but I am greatly disturbed by the situation here.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In my forty years of service, I have never seen such a situation where there is so much administration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It puts a shackle on the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must remove the concept of having responsible ones in the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let the saints meet and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I believe that if there were less administration in a district, the saints would come forth to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our situation can be compared to a family in which the elderly father and older siblings restrict the younger siblings from doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Too much administration can cause the saints to lose the spirit to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I do have a basis for saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many saints give up inwardly and no longer want to serve, because they were merely maintaining a fa ade.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we reduce the administration, the saints will be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The elders and responsible ones must not shackle the saints; instead, they must supply the saints so that the saints come forth to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The saints need to be free in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to the Bible, the co-workers and elders are raised up to meet a need.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If they become a system or an organization to control and rule over the church, they should be removed.</S>
