   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>An Example for Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1 Corinthians 9 the Apostle Paul compared the Christian life to a race.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the end of this race a prize awaits the winner.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter ten follows immediately concerning the history of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, in the original text there was no chapter division, so this was one continuous account.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Paul's concept the whole nation of Israel was in the wilderness running the race.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They all passed through the Red Sea; they all ate the same food; they all drank the same spiritual drink.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But not all of them entered into the good land; many of them died in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Corinthians 10:11 says that "All these things happened unto them for ensamples."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, the word "ensamples" should be "typically," that is, related to a type.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other words, all the things which happened to the children of Israel were types.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their experience was a type to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their crossing of the Red Sea was a type of our baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their eating of manna was a type of our eating of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their drinking of the water out of the rock was a type of our drinking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, all were wandering in the wilderness, and only four entered into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Two living ones of that generation, Joshua and Caleb, and two dead ones, Jacob and Joseph, entered the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is also a type to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that when the Lord Jesus comes back, some living saints and some dead saints, both of whom are overcomers, will enter into the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians have passed through the Red Sea and are wandering in the wilderness, but according to the type not many will cross over the Jordan River and enter into the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must take this as a serious and sober warning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This strongly admonishes us not to stay in our mind, but to turn to our spirit where we can enjoy Christ as our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our spirit we can have the full enjoyment of the riches of Christ, which will consummate in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SUPERIOR TO AARON AND ALL THE PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The third section of the book of Hebrews begins with the last verses of chapter four and goes through the end of chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this section Christ is compared with Aaron, the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is revealed as being much superior to Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ became a high priest not according to the order of Aaron, but according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The order of Melchisedec is an eternal order.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He ministered not according to any regulation or commandment of the law, but according to the power of an indestructible life Heb 7:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because He has this kind of priesthood, He is able to save us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are not saved to the uttermost, it does not mean He is not able to save.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, it means that we were not willing to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We will have no excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are willing to be saved, surely He will save us to the uttermost Heb 7:25 .</S>
