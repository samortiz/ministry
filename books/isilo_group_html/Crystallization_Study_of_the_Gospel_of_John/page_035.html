He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" (John 7:37-38).</li>		<li>This call is repeated by the Spirit with the bride for people to participate in the enjoyment of Christ in the New Jerusalem in John's last book, Revelation (22:17).</li>		<li>This indicates that the people who held the Feast of Tabernacles were not satisfied; the real satisfaction was to receive Christ and drink of Him that they would be not only satisfied but also overflowing with rivers of living water.</li>		<li>This is the enjoyment for satisfaction in drinking the river of water of life in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:1-2).</li>		<li>Hence, the New Jerusalem is called the tabernacle, indicating that those who participate in the New Jerusalem are the real keepers of the Feast of Tabernacles for eternity with full enjoyment and satisfaction.</li>		<li>The word Tabernacles in the title of the Feast of Tabernacles implies the thought of remembrance, that is, the Israelite keepers of the Feast of Tabernacles should remember that their forefathers dwelt in tents (tabernacles) in their wandering in the wilderness.</li>		<li>Similarly, even the New Jerusalem is called the tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:2-3) for the remembrance of the overcomers, who dwelt also in tents, in the first stage of the New Jerusalem.</li>		<li>The New Jerusalem will be consummated firstly to be the firstfruits in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the overcomers and then consummated lastly to be in the new heaven and new earth as the full enjoyment of God's full salvation to all the perfected believers. This will be the real Feast of Tabernacles.</li>		</ol>	</ol></ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 35</div><br></body></html>
