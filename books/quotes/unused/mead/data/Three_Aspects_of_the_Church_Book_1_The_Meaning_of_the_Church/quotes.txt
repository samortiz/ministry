[1]  Three Aspects of the Church: The Meaning of the Church, Book 1 CONTENTS
[2]  Our three daily sessions will cover the church in respect to three different aspects.
[3]  The first aspect concerns the spiritual aspects of the church, that is, the meaning of the church.
[4]  Ephesians 3:9-11 says, To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[5]  CHAPTER TWO GOD S PLAN CONCERNING THE CHURCH 1
[6]  The origin of the church is God s eternal plan.
[7]  The church did not come into existence by coincidence.
[8]  Neither did the church come into being simply because a group of sinners were saved by God and gathered together.
[9]  Second, God not only uses Himself as the resource to produce the church, but He also uses His power as the energy.
[10]  Ephesians 1:19 says, What is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength.
[11]  Verse 20 tells us that this power is the power that God used to raise Christ from the dead.
[12]  Ephesians 1:9 shows that the church was purposed in God in eternity according to the good pleasure of His will.
[13]  Moreover, God s plan for the church is altogether for His Son Col 1:16; John 3:35; Heb 1:2 .
[14]  God not only intends that His Son accomplish this plan, but He also desires that His Son inherit this plan.
[15]  In typology, God is typified by Abraham, His Son is typified by Isaac, and the church is typified by Rebekah.
[16]  The expression in Christ does not imply only that Christ is the One who accomplishes and inherits God s plan but also that everything in this plan is Christ.
[17]  In the economy of God s eternal plan God Himself is the resource, God s power is the energy, and God s wisdom is the means; moreover, Christ is God Himself, God s power, and God s wisdom.
[18]  According to the meaning of the Greek, God in His plan ordained that we would be His sons; then, having ordained us to be His sons, He ordained us to inherit all that He is.
[19]  Hence, the word sonship has two aspects in the original language: on one hand, God s life enters into the church, and on the other hand, the church enters into all that God is.
[20]  In the Chinese Union Version, the expression to be holy in Ephesians 1:4 is translated to be holy and clean.
[21]  Most people in Christianity have the concept that holiness is cleanness.
[22]  But the meaning of the word holy in the original languages of the Bible, both in the Hebrew of the Old Testament and in the Greek of the New Testament, focuses more on the aspect of being holy than on being clean or pure.
[23]  The preposition to in the original Greek may also be rendered into, as in Romans 6:3, baptized into His death.
[24]  Ephesians 1 indicates that in His plan God first desires that the church have His life, become His sons, and become His heirs to inherit His possessions.
[25]  Second, He desires that the church be made holy and be fully mingled with Him.
[26]  The church becomes holy by being sanctified and transformed, by having God mingled with the church and by the church being transformed from clay to gold.
[27]  At the end of Revelation, when the holy city New Jerusalem appears, God will be in the church and the church will be in God.
[28]  In eternity God chose the church, which means He marked out the church.
[29]  God manifests His wisdom in this great universe not only through Satan but even through small men, such as Job In the book of Job, Satan tried to do things to Job with his tactics and schemes, but Satan s cleverness simply gave God the opportunity to manifest His wisdom through Job
[30]  CHAPTER FOUR THE HEADING UP OF ALL THINGS Heading Up All Things
[31]  God s plan for the church is not only to mingle Himself with man and to make known to Satan and his angels the multifarious wisdom of God but also to head up all things in the heavens and on the earth in Christ His Son.
[32]  Verse 10 says, To head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.
[33]  Christ is the Head of the church, and He is the Head over all things to the church.
[34]  Whether Christ can be the Head over all things, whether all things can be subjected to the authority of Christ, and whether all things can be headed up in Christ completely depend upon whether or not the church exists, has been produced, and has grown up.
[35]  When the church exists, God is able to subject all things to the authority of Christ.
[36]  In order to see this, we must first see the oneness of the universe.
[37]  THE ONENESS IN THE UNIVERSE Scripture Reading: Ephesians 1:10, 22; 4:13 Satan Damaging the Oneness of God s Creation through Death
[38]  Nevertheless, God is now recovering us with His life so that we may be joined to Him.
[39]  Peace in this verse does not merely refer to sinners being reconciled to God but also to a restoration of the relationship between the universe and God, in which there is no separation from God.
[40]  By His power God caused all things to function in a normal relationship with Him.
[41]  Because of their relationship and function toward God under the power of His creation, all things were in harmony and the universe was one.
[42]  Once God s life entered into us, we were joined to Him, not only recovering our relationship with God as our Creator but also entering into union with Him in His life.
[43]  Then the church will be one and will arrive at the oneness v. 13 . After God has worked thoroughly in the church, the restoration of all things will begin.
[44]  God s work begins with the church and then spreads outward, passing through the church to all things.
[45]  All things will be enlightened by the light that shines out through the oneness of the church, all will know Jehovah in the light of the oneness of the church cf.
[46]  Through the completion of His work in the church, God will bring the church completely into glory so that she may be delivered from the old creation and fully enter into the new creation.
[47]  Ephesians 1:10 reveals that God is heading up all things in Christ.
[48]  His life is working and operating in the church to the extent that it will shine forth from the church as light to all things; all the nations will walk by its light Rev 21:24 , and all things will be headed up in the light.
[49]  The picture in Revelation 22 clearly reveals that there is a throne out from which proceeds a river of water of life in the New Jerusalem v. 1 . The New Jerusalem presents a picture of the life of God operating in us.
[50]  The result of the operation of the river of water of life is the shining forth of light from within the city.
[51]  The Lord is life John 11:25 , and the Lord is also light 1 John 1:5 .
[52]  According to the Gospel of John, the entrance of God s life into us and its operation in us, brings in the light of life 8:12 .
[53]  If the church allows God to move freely, it will be able to shine forth God.
[54]  Ephesians 1:10 says, Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.
[55]  We need the Holy Spirit to show us the real significance of this word.
[56]  As we learn to live in God s life and gain a certain amount of knowledge regarding the church, the Holy Spirit will reveal to us that God needs a group of people who live in His life and allow His life to shine forth from them in order to bring all things into the light of life to be headed up in Christ.
[57]  Even though God s life is in us, if the light of life cannot be diffused out from us, we can never arrive at the oneness.
[58]  The church is not merely a vessel but the Body of Christ.
[59]  However, the present condition of the church does not match this reality.
[60]  Although we have a royal status, our condition is altogether improper.
[61]  Whenever we allow the glorious life of Christ to live out from us and God s light to shine forth from us, God will cause people to turn to Him through us and to us.
[62]  When we speak of the types of the church, we need to start from the very beginning of the Bible.
[63]  In the Old Testament, God arranged a number of persons, matters, and things to be types of the church in order to explain the history, the process, and the different aspects of the church in the New Testament.
[64]  In the Old Testament, God did not explicitly speak of the church.
[65]  God, however, arranged certain persons and established certain matters and things to portray and typify the various aspects of the church in a detailed way.
[66]  If we read the explanation in the New Testament and compare it to the picture in the Old Testament, we will have a clear view and an accurate conclusion regarding the producing of the church, and it will be easy to know the nature of the church.
[67]  If we take a rib out of the human body, the rib will surely die.
[68]  First Peter 1:3 says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[69]  On the day of His resurrection, He caused the grain of wheat to become many grains and the only begotten Son of God to become the Firstborn among God s many sons.
[70]  On the morning of the Lord s resurrection, He told Mary, Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God John 20:17 .
[71]  The producing of Eve was through the rib that God took from Adam s side, typifying that the church is produced through the three steps that Christ passed through incarnation, death, and resurrection.
[72]  The calling of the church includes God the Father s sending of the Holy Spirit, the object of the calling, and the arrangement of the circumstances.
[73]  Moreover, when the servant met Rebekah according to the circumstances arranged by God, she received the sealing of the Holy Spirit in type.
[74]  On the day that the servant encountered Rebekah, he testified on behalf of Isaac, saying, Sarah my master s wife bore a son to my master after she had become old.
[75]  And he has given all that he has to him v. 36 . This signifies the Holy Spirit testifying of Christ.
[76]  When the Holy Spirit calls man, He enables man to know that Christ is the Son of God and that God has given everything in the universe to Christ.
[77]  Everything of God and everything He has accomplished, have been given to His Son as the Heir Heb 1:2 .
[78]  When we are called, the Holy Spirit testifies within us that all that God has is for His Son.
[79]  After the servant finished the sealing, testifying, and pledging, Rebekah should have immediately followed him.
[80]  Her mother and brother, however, were reluctant to let her go and requested that she stay for at least ten days Gen 24:55 .
[81]  There are many women in the Old Testament, but not all of them are types of the church.
[82]  Whether a woman in the Old Testament can be considered a type of the church is determined by her husband.
[83]  If her husband is a type of Christ, she can be considered as a type of the church.
[84]  Eve is a type of the church because her husband, Adam, typifies Christ.
[85]  Although it is difficult to find a basis in the New Testament for saying that Joseph typifies Christ, according to the record in Genesis Joseph s entire life experience was exactly the same as Christ s. Therefore, Joseph is a type of Christ, and his wife, Asenath, is a type of the church.
[86]  Originally, Ruth had nothing to do with God s blessing, was not able to enter the congregation of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation, and was forsaken and separated from God s holy people.
[87]  Through the experience of these points, the church is redeemed to be the counterpart of Christ and to be one with Christ to inherit the lawful blessing of God, the blessing given by God to Abraham.
[88]  Some people think that Christ s glorification will begin with His second coming; however, the Bible clearly reveals that Christ entered into glory after His death and resurrection.
[89]  What we believe is not dead and empty doctrine; instead, in our spirit we have touched the Spirit, the Lord who is in resurrection and glory.
[90]  If we allow Him to operate and move within us, we will be able to live a life just as that of Jesus the Nazarene, and we will be able to follow in His footsteps.
[91]  Christ is typified by Solomon, whom the Shulammite enjoyed and experienced.
[92]  First, the names Shulammite and Solomon have the same root, just as Christian and Christ have the same root.
[93]  This means that in resurrection the church has the peace of Christ and is peace.
[94]  All that the church has passed through over the past two thousand years and the beauty of the church are of the Christ of resurrection, typified by the gold covering the Shulammite, her garment of woven work inwrought with gold, and her embroidered clothing vv.
[95]  Second, as seen in the type of Rebekah, God sent the Holy Spirit to the earth after Christ s ascension, to the place of the Lord s kinsmen according to His humanity, and the Holy Spirit called out a group of people to be Christ s counterpart, the church.
[96]  They depict the church in a clear way: as coming out of Christ, being called out from the world, ministering together with Christ the bread of life in the world, wandering in the wilderness with Christ, receiving the redemption of Christ, warring by following Christ to fight for God s kingdom, and eventually becoming Christ s counterpart and reigning with Him in glory.
[97]  The types in the Old Testament concerning the church can be divided into two main categories: women and dwelling places the tabernacle, the temple, and a city.
[98]  The children of Israel connect two categories because God considers the children of Israel as a corporate woman as well as His habitation.
[99]  In the Old Testament, God regarded the children of Israel as His spouse, His wife.
[100]  Ephesians clearly says that the church is Christ s counterpart 5:31-32 and that the church is also God s dwelling place 2:22 .
[101]  In addition, Revelation speaks of the New Jerusalem as the wife of the Lamb 21:2, 9 , indicating that the church is God s dwelling place as well as His counterpart.
[102]  Before God saved the children of Israel, He chose them to be His people.
[103]  The children of Israel went down to Egypt and fell into Pharaoh s hand, typifying the church, chosen by God in eternity, falling into the satanic world under the authority of Satan.
[104]  The children of Israel kept the passover in Egypt, typifying the church being redeemed by God.
[105]  The history of the children of Israel in the wilderness is altogether a history of failures.
[106]  It took them a total of thirty-eight years to travel from their crossing of the Red Sea to their crossing of the Jordan River.
[107]  During this period of time, the situation of the children of Israel can be described as a huge failure, and it typifies the condition of failure in the church.
[108]  On the one hand, it typifies the riches of Christ, and on the other hand, it typifies the heavenlies; both of these aspects are spoken of in Ephesians.
[109]  Ephesians 3:8 speaks of the riches of Christ, and Ephesians 1:3 and 2:6 speak of the heavenlies.
[110]  This means that when the church fulfills God s purpose, it immediately enjoys the riches of Christ and engages in spiritual warfare.
[111]  Once the children of Israel entered Canaan, they began to engage in warfare.
[112]  After him, various judges continued to fight for God.
[113]  Through warfare, God s kingdom was brought in. Hence, the riches of Christ and the spiritual warfare have the purpose and result of bringing in the kingdom of God.
[114]  The final result of the church s warfare is to bring in God s kingdom.
[115]  Revelation 12 shows that the overcomers will war with Satan, the result of which will be the coming of the kingdom of God v. 10 . Today some in the church are in the wilderness, and others are already in Canaan fighting for God.
[116]  The result of this warfare is that Satan will be cast down from the air and then from the earth, at which time the authority of God, the kingdom of God, will be brought to the earth.
[117]  We need to fight continually until the kingdom is established and the King of peace is enthroned; that is, we need to fight until the authority of God is brought to the earth, until Christ comes back, and until He becomes the King of peace on the throne of God, governing and ruling over everything.
[118]  The establishment of the kingdom of Israel and the building of the temple typify the church bringing in the kingdom of God, attaining to God s purpose, and being full of glory.
[119]  When Solomon dedicated the temple to God, there were priests in the temple and kings in the city.
[120]  The temple was the holy temple, and the city was the city of Jerusalem.
[121]  According to the history of the church, the church also became desolate, losing the presence, authority, and revelation of God.
[122]  When the church degraded into Roman Catholicism, God s presence and authority were lost, and all that remained was human rule cf.
[123]  In this chapter we will see how the tabernacle typifies the church Exo 26:15-30; 36:20-34 .
[124]  The tabernacle came into existence when the people of Israel left Egypt and came to Mount Sinai to serve God.
[125]  The tabernacle was the center of children of Israel, and the twelve tribes of Israel encamped around the tabernacle.
[126]  The tabernacle also was the means through which they served God.
[127]  In terms of the members of the church, every believer is a tabernacle of God, a temple of God, a habitation of God.
[128]  The boards of the tabernacle were standing boards Exo 26:15 .
[129]  The tabernacle was a portable structure that could be taken apart, freely moved, and then assembled together again.
[130]  The overlaying of the wood with gold signifies that the church is the mingling of God and man; hence, the church is an entity composed of two natures.
[131]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 6 THE TABERNACLE 2 The Covering of the Tabernacle
[132]  Exodus 26:1-14 describes the four layers of the covering of the tabernacle, beginning from the inner to the outer layer.
[133]  The first layer was made of ten curtains of fine twined linen.
[134]  The second layer of the covering of the tabernacle was made of goats hair Exo 26:7-13 .
[135]  Its floor was the sandy soil of the wilderness.
[136]  In the tabernacle, everything elevated is detailed and intricate, but everything positioned close to the earth is simple and plain.
[137]  This signifies that although the church is located on the earth, she is heavenly.
[138]  Those living in the outer court contact the altar and the laver Exo 40:29-32 .
[139]  The altar was where offerings were offered to make expiation for the offerer Lev 1:4 , and the laver was for washing the hands and feet.
[140]  They know Christ as their bread of life, live in Christ as the light of life, and fellowship with God by relying on Christ as their acceptance before God.
[141]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 7 THE TABERNACLE 3 The Content
[142]  The real value of the tabernacle altogether depended upon its content, just as the nobility of a house depends upon those who live in it.
[143]  Some people have once said that all the furniture and utensils in the tabernacle, according to their sizes, could fit in the altar.
[144]  In other words, the capacity of the altar was sufficient to contain all the furniture and utensils in the tabernacle.
[145]  Moreover, the history of the Jews also tells us that when the children of Israel journeyed through the wilderness, every time they rolled up their tents to proceed, they put all the furniture and utensils of the tabernacle into the altar.
[146]  Proceeding inward from the outer court, a priest would enter the Holy Place, in which there were three items.
[147]  A separating veil was located between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies.
[148]  The veil typifies the man of flesh, which the Lord Jesus put on.
[149]  The bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar in the Holy Place typify Christ as our bread of life, our light of life, and our acceptance before God.
[150]  However, the Ark in the Holy of Holies refers to Christ Himself, to God Himself.
[151]  The incense altar was the basis and proof of man s acceptance by God, and the budding rod was the basis and proof that Aaron s house was accepted by God.
[152]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 8 THE TABERNACLE 4 The Hangings of the Outer Court
[153]  The hangings of the outer court were a wall of hangings made of fine white linen.
[154]  The hangings were portable and could be taken down and put up at any time.
[155]  A person could enter the outer court by passing through the linen hangings of the tabernacle.
[156]  The outer boundary of the tabernacle consisted of linen hangings, and within the tabernacle was a veil.
[157]  The temple and the tabernacle reveal two aspects of the church, each appearing in two different periods of Israel s history.
[158]  During the time of Israel s sojourning in the wilderness, there was the tabernacle; after Israel settled down in Canaan, there was the temple.
[159]  In its move, it was the tabernacle, and in its residence, it was the temple.
[160]  Just as the tabernacle is a type of the church, the temple is also a type of the church.
[161]  Just as the tabernacle was God s dwelling place on earth, the temple also was God s dwelling place on earth.
[162]  Even though David had this desire, God did not allow David to build a house for Him because David had shed blood abundantly and waged great wars 1 Chron 22:7-8 .
[163]  In typology, this refers to Christ in His suffering before He entered into glory.
[164]  He was not able to build the temple until He entered into glory.
[165]  As long as Christ stayed in His suffering, the church could not be produced.
[166]  According to the record in the Old Testament, the principal building materials for the temple were timber and stone; in addition, there were gold, silver, and bronze.
[167]  The stones were cut in a mountain quarry in the wilderness with much effort 6:7 .
[168]  This signifies that the materials for the building of the church are found in the world and cut with much effort.
[169]  Besides wood and stone, gold was also used in the building of the temple 1 Kings 6:20-21, 30, 32, 35; 7:48-51 .
[170]  In typology, gold signifies a great principle in the building of the church.
[171]  Gold denotes that in the church there is not only man but also God.
[172]  When God is added to man who has passed through death and resurrection and who has been dealt with, two natures divinity and humanity are mingled together to become God s dwelling place on earth.
[173]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 10 THE TEMPLE 2 The Way to Build The Design
[174]  When Moses built the tabernacle, he built it according to the pattern that was shown to him in the mountain by God.
[175]  This pattern was not according to man s opinion or imagination but was according to God s revelation Exo 25:40; 39:42-43; Heb 8:5 .
[176]  First Chronicles 28:11-19 indicates that the Spirit of God inspired David with the design for the construction of the temple.
[177]  The blueprint for the building of the church was not revealed at the time of Christ s resurrection; rather, God revealed the blueprint for building the church while Christ was passing through suffering on earth.
[178]  David prepared the materials for the building of the temple.
[179]  In 1 Chronicles 29:3 and 5 David said, Furthermore, because I set my affection on the house of my God, and since I have a private treasure of gold and silver, I give it for the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for this holy house...Gold for the things of gold and the silver for the things of silver and for all the work by the hands of the craftsmen.
[180]  In these verses the thought related to consecration for the building of the church is not according to our usual understanding of consecration, which is to offer material things to God.
[181]  Moreover, the work had to be done without any noise.
[182]  Every piece of stone used for the building of the temple was, in principle, already cut and dealt with in the mountains 1 Kings 5:15-18; 6:7 .
[183]  A person must be dealt with by God in order to have his function manifested and to be built up in the church.
[184]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 11 THE TEMPLE 3 The Course of the Temple
[185]  If a person wants to know the significance of the course of the temple, he must understand its origin.
[186]  The peak in the history of the temple was the day that Solomon dedicated the temple to God.
[187]  Not long afterward, the temple began to have problems.
[188]  However, the temple itself, as a symbol, did not have problems; rather, the children of Israel, as the reality of the temple, had problems before God.
[189]  First, they did not allow God to rule among them; second, they did not fellowship with God but instead worshipped idols; and third, they went to Egypt to seek help.
[190]  The church was originally composed of people separated from the world, who had been gained by God, had fellowship with God, and were ruled by God.
[191]  During the desolation of the temple, God gained a few among the captives.
[192]  From the record in Daniel we see that even in a desolate situation, in which nearly everyone worshipped idols and God seemingly was not able to do anything, God still gained a few.
[193]  Of the seven women as types of the church, Eve typifies the church being produced as well as the nature of the church, Rebekah typifies the church being chosen from the world, Asenath typifies the church being obtained by God in the world, Zipporah typifies the church in the wilderness, Ruth typifies the church being redeemed, Abigail typifies the warring church in the midst of sufferings, and the Shulammite typifies the church experiencing the resurrected Christ and enjoying rest with Christ in a condition of resurrection and glory.
