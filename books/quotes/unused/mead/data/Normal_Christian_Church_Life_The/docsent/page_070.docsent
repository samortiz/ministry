   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The second kind of meeting is mentioned in the first Epistle to the Corinthians:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak in tongues, and some unlearned in tongues or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are insane?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What then, brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let all things be done for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two, or at the most three, and in turn, and one should interpret; but if there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church, and speak to himself and to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And as to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets; for God is not a God of confusion but of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As in all the churches of the saints 4:23, 26-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is obviously a church meeting, because it is not one man leading while all the others follow, but each gifted one contributing to the meeting as the Spirit directs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the apostolic meetings there is a definite distinction between the preacher and his audience, but in this kind of meeting any gifted member of the church may be preacher and any may be audience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nothing is determined by man, and each takes part as the Spirit leads.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not an "all-man" ministry, but a Holy Spirit ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The prophets and teachers minister the Word as the Lord gives it, while others minister to the assembly in other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not all can prophesy and teach, but all can seek to prophesy and teach v. 1 . An opportunity is given to each member of the church to help others, and an opportunity is given to each one to be helped.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One brother may speak at one stage of the gathering and another later on; you may be chosen of the Spirit to help the brethren this time, and I next time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything in the meeting is governed throughout by the principle of "two or three" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>27, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even the same two or three prophets are not permanently appointed to minister to the meetings, but at each meeting the Spirit chooses any two or three from among all the prophets present.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That such assemblies are assemblies of the church is seen at a glance, because the stamp of mutuality is clearly upon all the proceedings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is only one verse in the New Testament which speaks of the importance of Christians meeting together; it is Hebrews 10:25: "Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This verse shows that the object of such assembling is to exhort "one another."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is obviously not an apostolic meeting, for it is not a case of one man exhorting the entire assembly, but all the members bearing equal responsibility to exhort one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A church meeting has the stamp of "one another" upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are several purposes for which the church meets, as recorded in Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, for prayer Acts 2:42; 4:24, 31; 12:5 ; second, for reading Col 4:16; 1 Thes 5:27; Acts 2:42; 15:21, 30-31 ; third, for the breaking of bread which are not meetings presided over by a single individual who bears all responsibility, since reference is made to "the cup of blessing which we bless the bread which we break" 1 Cor 10:16-17; Acts 2:42; 20:7 ; and fourth, for the exercise of spiritual gifts 1 Cor 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The last type of meeting is a church meeting, for the phrase "in the church" is used repeatedly in the passage which describes it vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>28, 34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of this meeting it is said that all may prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How different from one man preaching and all the others sitting quietly in the pew listening to his sermon!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That meeting has no place among the different gatherings of the church, for its nature makes it evident that it is an apostolic meeting, and being an apostolic meeting, it belongs to the sphere of the work, not of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Meetings where activity is one-sided do not come within the scope of the church, for they lack the distinctive feature of all church gatherings; and where any attempt is made to fit them into the church program, much trouble is sure to result.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today, alas! this style of meeting is the chief feature of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No meeting is attended with such regularity as this one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who is considered a really good Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Is it not one who comes to church fifty-two Sunday mornings in the year to hear the minister preach?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But this is passivity, and it heralds death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even he who has attended "church" fifty-two Sundays in the year has not really been once to a church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has only gone to a meeting in connection with the work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not imply that we should never have this kind of meeting, but the point is that such a meeting is part of the work and is not part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you have a worker in the locality, then you may have this type of meeting, not otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The local church, as a church, has no such meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Where they are found in connection with a church, we must discourage them and help believers to see that church meetings are conducted by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If apostolic meetings take the place of church meetings, then the church members become passive and indolent, always expecting to be helped, instead of seeking, in dependence upon the Spirit, to be helpful to the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is contrary to the New Testament principles of mutual help and mutual edification.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The reason the churches in China are still so weak, after a hundred years of Christian missions, is that God's servants have introduced into the local churches a type of meeting that really belongs to the work, and the church members have naturally concluded that if they attend such services and just passively receive all that is taught them there, they have performed the chief part of their Christian duty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Individual responsibility has been lost sight of, and passivity has hindered the development of spiritual life throughout the churches.</S>
