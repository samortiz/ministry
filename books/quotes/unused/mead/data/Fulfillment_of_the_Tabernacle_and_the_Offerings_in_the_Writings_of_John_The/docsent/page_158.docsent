   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Doing the Father's Will</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Son and the Father have one will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Son does the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In John 5:30 the Lord says, "I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in John 6:38 the Lord testified that He came down from heaven to do the will of Him who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Speaking the Father's Word</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Son speaks the Father's word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whatever is spoken by the Son is the word of the Father, because the Son does not speak His own word, but speaks the Father's word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 14:24 the Lord says concerning this, "He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 7:16 the Lord said regarding His teaching, "My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Son speaks the Father's word because the Son does not speak from Himself: "For I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who sent Me has Himself given Me commandment what I should say and what I should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And I know that His commandment is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak" 12:49-50 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Seeking the Father's Glory</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Son seeks the Father's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 7:18 says, "He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse proves that the Son does not seek His own glory, but seeks the glory of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Son's will is the Father's will, the Son's work is the Father's work, the Son's word is the Father's word, and the Son's glory is the Father's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Son has nothing of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All that the Son has is from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Son and the Father truly are one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Expressing the Father</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Son does not express Himself; instead, He expresses the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Son's expression is the Father's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, when we see the Son, we see the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is proved by the exchange between the Lord Jesus and Philip.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In John 14:7 the Lord pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known His Father also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then He said, "Henceforth you know Him and have seen Him."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, Philip replied, "Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us" v. 8 . To this, the Lord Jesus answered, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How is it that you say, Show us the Father?" v. 9 . In the Son the Father is expressed and seen, for the Son is the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sending the Spirit from with the Father</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Gospel of John reveals that the Son sends the Spirit from with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In John 15:26 the Lord speaks of the Comforter, whom He "will send to you from with the Father" lit .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then in 16:7 He goes on to say, "For if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These verses indicate that the Son sent the Spirit from with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, this means that the Son sent Himself, because the Son is in the Father, and the Spirit comes from with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, the One who is sent by the Son from the Father is actually the Son Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Giving the Spirit to Us</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Son also gives the Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to John 3:34b, "He gives the Spirit not by measure."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit is from with the Father, and the Son is in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever the Son gives is the Son Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the Spirit given by the Son is actually the Son Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Becoming the Spirit through Death and Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Son became the Spirit through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to 1 Corinthians 15:45b, Christ, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the day of His resurrection, Christ breathed on His disciples and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may say that Christ already was the Spirit when He was in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The difference here is that His flesh was a covering comparable to a shell.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Through death and resurrection, the opaque shell of the flesh became transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, now we can see that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through death and resurrection, the last Adam in the opaque shell of the flesh became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is still the same Jesus, but now the shell is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, the One who was with the disciples is the same One who is now the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Abiding in Us as the Spirit with the Father</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After becoming the Spirit, the Lord abides in us as the Spirit with the Father John 14:16-20; 17:23, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do you know who abides in you?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Son abides in you as the Spirit with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Son sends the Spirit, and then the Son comes with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, when the Spirit comes, the Son comes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, when the Son comes, the Father also comes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means that when the Spirit comes, all Three of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit come.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, now the Son abides in us as the Spirit with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is for the dispensing of the Triune God into our being.</S>
