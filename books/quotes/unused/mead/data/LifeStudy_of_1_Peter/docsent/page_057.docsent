   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OUTLINE OF FIRST PETER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The beauty of Peter s thought is seen in the outline of this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I can testify that I spent a great deal of time to outline 1 Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was a great pressure upon me, for it was extremely difficult to determine where to draw the lines between the various sections of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe it would be very helpful at this point to consider the outline of 1 Peter:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Introduction to the Pilgrims in Dispersion under the Operation of the Triune God 1:1-2 Full Salvation of the Triune God and Its Issues 1:3-25 The Father s Regeneration unto a Living Hope, an Inheritance Kept in the Heavens and Ready to Be Revealed at the Last Time 1:3-9 The Spirit s Application through the Prophets Prophesying and the Apostles Preaching 1:10-12 Christ s Redemption unto a Holy Life by the Holy Nature, and Brotherly Love through Purification by the Sanctifying Truth, Based on Regeneration of the Incorruptible Seed through the Living Word of God 1:13-25 Growth in Life and Its Results 2:1-10 Growing by Feeding on the Milk of the Word unto Full Salvation 2:1-3 Transformed unto the Building Up of a Spiritual House for God s Dwelling, a Holy Priesthood for God s Service 2:4-8 To Tell Out the Virtues of the Calling One 2:9-10 Christian Life and Its Sufferings 2:11 4:19 A Life in an Excellent Manner toward All Men in All Concerns 2:11 3:13 As Pilgrims among the Nations 2:11-12 Toward Human Institution 2:13-17 Servants toward Masters 2:18-20 The Model of Christ 2:21-25 In Marriage Life 3:1-7 In Common Life 3:8-13 Suffering for Righteousness by the Will of God as Christ Did 3:14-22 Arming Themselves with the Mind of Christ for Suffering 4:1-6 Ministering as Good Stewards of the Varied Grace of God 4:7-11 Rejoicing in Sharing the Sufferings of Christ 4:12-19 The Elders Shepherding and Its Reward 5:1-4 The Shepherding Patterns 5:1-3 The Chief Shepherd s Reward 5:4 The Mighty Hand of God and Its Goal 5:5-11 Humbled under God s Mighty Hand 5:5-9 Perfected and Grounded by the God of All Grace 5:10-11 Conclusion 5:12-14 Testimony of the True Grace of God 5:12 Greetings 5:13-14</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the introduction to this Epistle 1:1-2 we see that the operation of God s economy is to bring us into the full enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What a great matter this is!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then in the first section 1:3-25 we have the full salvation of the Triune God and its issues.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s full salvation includes the regeneration of the Father, the redemption of the Son, and the sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The issues of this full salvation are a holy manner of life and an unfeigned brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second section of this Epistle covers the growth in life and its results 2:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to grow in life, we need to long for the guileless milk of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is by this milk that we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The result of the growth in life is transformation, building up, and the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By the growth in life we are transformed and built up, and then we become God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The third section of this Epistle, concerned with the Christian life and its sufferings, is the longest 2:11 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter takes more than two whole chapters to cover this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this portion of his Epistle he does not speak of the Christian life and its enjoyment; he speaks concerning the Christian life and its sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the messages to come we shall see what these sufferings are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the lengthy section on the Christian life and its sufferings, Peter has two short sections on the elders shepherding and its reward 5:1-4 and the mighty hand of God and its goal 5:5-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Finally, in 5:12-14, we have the conclusion.</S>
