        <h2 class="head2">Baptized into the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Our being in the Triune God corresponds with the baptism in Matthew 28:19. When we were baptized, we were baptized into the Triune God. It is not too much to say that we are now in the Triune God because we have been put into Him. Have we not been put into the Triune God? To be baptized is not to be baptized into Christianity, into a kind of religion, or denomination. To be baptized is to be baptized into the Triune God. The word baptize is the anglicized form of the Greek word <em>baptizo</em>. It means to drop or dip something into the water. Baptism is to be dipped, not into the water of the baptistry, but into the Triune God. Since the time we were baptized, we have been persons in the Triune God. We are in the Triune God, and we speak in the Triune God.</p>
<p>Those under the influence of the Pentecostal teaching may insist that to be in the Holy Spirit, one must go through a kind of &ldquo;baptism in the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; after which he will speak in tongues. I myself was in the Pentecostal movement. I stayed with them and I joined in with them for over one year, at which time I spoke in tongues. I observed all those things. Eventually, I concluded that it was a falsehood, and I had to drop it. I am bold to say that today&rsquo;s speaking in tongues is, at least mostly, a falsehood. In the New Testament, speaking in tongues is mentioned in three books. The first mention is in Mark 16:17. The fulfillment of this verse was firstly in Acts 2. In this chapter the tongues spoken there were the different foreign dialects of the attendants who came from various parts of the world. The listeners said, &ldquo;And how is it that we each hear them in our own dialect in which we were born?...We hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God&rdquo; (Acts 2:8, 11). This is strong proof that tongue-speaking must be an understandable language, not merely a voice or sound uttered by the tongue. The third book that speaks about tongues is 1 Corinthians. In 1 Corinthians 14:27 Paul says, &ldquo;If anyone speaks in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and in turn, and let one interpret.&rdquo; If the tongue were not a dialect, how could anyone translate it? Some may excuse the practice of merely uttering sounds or voices by claiming that these are the &ldquo;tongues of angels.&rdquo; However, these may rather be sounds of human manufacture. Often an interpretation will be given for such a tongue. On three different occasions the interpretation of the same tongue may be greatly different. I saw this happen. Is this not falsehood? In this kind of meeting the utterance may sometimes take the form of a prediction or prophecy. Eventually the thing predicted does not happen. I have seen prophecies of earthquakes, healings, and resurrections, yet those things never came about.</p>
<p>Dear saints, do not listen to this kind of teaching, but come back to the pure Bible. The pure New Testament gives us the good news, the glad tidings, the gospel, which tells us, firstly that our Triune God according to His eternal purpose became a man. This man named Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He went to the cross and was crucified there for you and me, for all God&rsquo;s chosen people, and for our sins. Not only was Jesus crucified there, but within Him the Triune God was crucified on the cross. His death is all-inclusive and eternal. That all-inclusive death accomplished the eternal redemption. Then He came out of death, He resurrected, becoming a life-giving Spirit. On the day of His resurrection He came back to the disciples and breathed Himself as the life-giving Spirit into them. Then He stayed with His disciples, appearing and disappearing for forty days. He ascended to the heavens and was there for ten days. On the day of Pentecost He poured Himself out as the Spirit of power economically on His disciples who had already received the Spirit of life essentially. At that point He had accomplished His entire and full salvation. From His incarnation to His outpouring as the Spirit of power economically, was the full course of His full salvation. This is the gospel, and this gospel has become the bequest in the New Testament. The New Testament simply means a new will, a divine will made as a new covenant by the dying Christ and given as a New Testament by the resurrected Christ. In this testament God has bequeathed all these wonderful items to us. Now we have this will. Therefore, incarnation is our blessing, my portion. His human living is our portion. His death is our portion. His resurrection is our portion. His breathing of Himself as the life-giving Spirit into His disciples is our portion. His ascension is our portion. And His pouring out of Himself as the Spirit of power upon His disciples economically is also our portion. All these are our portion. When we believed in Him and received Him, we received this will and all the items in it. Now we are fully identified with Him. We are fully joined to Him. We have been baptized into Him, and this baptism gives us an organic union with the Triune God. Whatever He has gone through, becomes our history. His incarnation is ours. His living on the earth is ours. His death on the cross is ours. His resurrection is ours. His breathing of the Spirit into the disciples is ours. His ascension is ours. And His pouring out of the Spirit is ours. Whatever He has gone through is ours.</p>
<p>Are you crucified? Yes, we were crucified two thousand years ago. Are you in the Spirit? Yes, two thousand years ago we were put into Him. Is the Spirit in you? Yes, twenty centuries ago the Holy Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, was breathed into us already. This is the gospel. Any speaking to the contrary is not the full gospel. The full gospel comprises His incarnation, His human life on earth, His death, His resurrection, His breathing, His ascension, and His outpouring. When I believed, I received the items of the full gospel. Therefore, the life-giving Spirit is in me essentially, and the Spirit of power is upon me economically. First Peter says that the Spirit of glory and of God is resting upon us (1 Pet. 4:14).</p>
<p>Now you can see that we are in the Spirit and in the Triune God. Therefore, we speak in the Triune God. If I were to speak that I am so weak and not in the Spirit, I would be lying to you. I would be speaking without faith. Speak in the Holy Spirit! &ldquo;No one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 12:3). We can say Lord Jesus in the Holy Spirit. Do not be troubled by the question, &ldquo;Have you received the Spirit?&rdquo; You should say, &ldquo;Why not! I have received the Holy Spirit. I am speaking Jesus. I am speaking Christ. I am speaking &lsquo;Lord Jesus.&rsquo; I speak in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
