   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>UNBELIEVERS BLINDED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE GOD OF THIS AGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2 Corinthians 4, Paul gives us the general case.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 4 he says that the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of those who do not believe Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>. The god of this age is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who are blinded or veiled think that they do not worship anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, their god is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Atheists worship Satan without knowing what they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All people today, whether primitive or highly cultured, have been blinded by the god of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consider all those you see on the street or in the supermarkets.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How few of them know God!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is true even among a vast number of those who go to today s chapels, cathedrals, and denominational buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is little revelation of the Son of God, and there is veil upon veil to keep people from knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In their blindness, many condemn those who have seen the vision of the living Person of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE NEED TO DROP OUR CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would receive the revelation of the Son of God, we need to drop our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every concept, whether spiritual or carnal, is a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have spent many years groping in my search to learn how to have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually I discovered that to have revelation we need to drop our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God today is shining everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This age of grace is an age of light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is shining, and the Bible is shining also.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible is full of light, and it has been printed in hundreds of languages.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moreover, the all-inclusive Spirit moving on earth is full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But although the Bible is shining and the Spirit is moving, many still do not receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason is that they hold to certain concepts and are veiled by these concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As you contact people from various nationalities, you will find that all of them are strong in their concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is also true among us in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, I worship the Lord for all the growth and improvement among us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, I realize that many veils still remain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These veils are the concepts that blind us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With respect to receiving revelation, there is no problem on God s side.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On His side everything is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem is altogether on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to drop the veils, that is, to drop our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is important for us to pray, Lord, help me to drop everything that is a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you hold on to your concepts while reading the Bible, you will be like the ancient Jews who had a veil on their mind whenever the Scriptures were read.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if you drop your concepts as you read the Word, you will read it with an unveiled face.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the light will shine into you subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I was born into Christianity, and from childhood I heard about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, I was not saved until I was nineteen years old.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I knew about Jesus, and I was in favor of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But I was not saved until the Son of God was revealed in me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day, when I was nineteen, God shined into me, and I received a revelation of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time I began to have direct personal contact with Him and to know Him as a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I touched Him, and I was touched by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Between Him and me there was a living transaction, a living contact.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all need a direct, personal, living contact with the living Person of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>TURNING OUR HEARTS TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today many of us earnestly desire to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But to live Christ we need revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we have pointed out again and again, the only way revelation can come to us is if we drop our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We also need to pray, Lord, I trust in You to defeat the god of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Apart from You, I do not worship anything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lord, I turn my heart to You, and I drop all my concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I don t want to worship anyone other than You.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you pray in this way, the light will shine, and you will receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you drop your concepts and turn your heart to the Lord, the veils will be taken away, and the god of this age will have no ground in your being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The light is here, and it is shining.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our problem is that our heart is turned away to many other things, and therefore we are covered with layer upon layer of veils.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This enables the god of this age to have ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As a result, our thoughts are darkened, blinded, and hardened, and we cannot receive revelation, even though we may read the Bible and listen to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Oh, how we need revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord was very merciful to Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First, He knocked him down and then caused him to drop all the veils.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before the Lord appeared to him on the way to Damascus, Saul was altogether veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to his opinion, Jesus the Nazarene had been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He had been crucified and buried, and was in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But when Saul was on the way to Damascus, the Lord Jesus appeared to him from the heavens, and spontaneously Saul called, Who art thou, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord Jesus replied, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord s answer took away a thick veil.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The light of the gospel of the glory of Christ shined into Saul of Tarsus, and he saw the glory of God in the face of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we would see such a revelation of the living Person, we must begin by dropping our veils, our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Second, we need to turn our hearts to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>According to 2 Corinthians 3:16, when the heart turns to the Lord, the veil will be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The more you turn your heart to the Lord, the less ground the god of this age will have in your life and in your being.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then you will be under the shining of the heavenly light, and you will receive the revelation of the living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I can testify that in the early years of my Christian life, I had little revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I was veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But one day the veils began to drop, and the light shined into me.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Since that time, the light has been coming again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>For this reason, it is not difficult for me to receive revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Let us all drop the veils and, by His mercy and grace, turn our hearts to Him.</S>
