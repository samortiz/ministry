   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Who Can Count the Dust of Jacob, /</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Or Number the Fourth Part of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 10 Balaam went on to say, Who can count the dust of Jacob, / Or number the fourth part of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>/ Let me die the death of the upright, / And let my latter end be like theirs!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verse contains the blessing of increase.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jacob will be innumerable, uncountable, like the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one will be able to count even the fourth part of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first parable is a blessing upon the children of Israel as a separate people, a particular and special class of people who live alone and who are not reckoned among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because this people will be blessed with abundant increase, no one will be able to count them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Balaam s word of blessing and appreciation concerning Israel offended Balak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, Balak said to him, What have you done to me?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I took you to curse my enemies, but now you have altogether blessed them v. 11 . Balaam replied, Shall I not take care to speak what Jehovah puts in my mouth? v. 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE SECOND PARABLE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verses 13 through 26 we see Balaam s second parable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Balak said to Balaam, Come now with me to another place from which you may see them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You will see only the outside edge of them and not see them all; then curse them for me from there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Balak and all the rulers of Moab stood beside Balaam s burnt offering while Jehovah put a word in Balaam s mouth, and Balaam prophesied in a second parable vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>15-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A. God Not Beholding Iniquity in Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nor Seeing Trouble in Israel</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One of the most striking lines in this parable is in verse 21: He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, / Nor has He seen trouble in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Balaam s word was spoken not according to the human view but according to the divine view.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s view is different from man s view.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is obvious that the children of Israel had many iniquities, but God does not look at what His redeemed people are in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s redeemed people have a twofold status: their status in themselves and their status in God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Balaam s prophecy indicates that God cares for His people s status in His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word trouble means hard things, evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Trouble is even worse than iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the sight of God there was neither iniquity nor trouble in His people Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God surely had the standing to say that He did not behold iniquity in Jacob nor see trouble in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His people had been redeemed and forgiven; therefore, God could say that they were without iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Balaam, under the control and inspiration of God, had no choice but to declare that God did not behold iniquity or see trouble in the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>B. Having the Shout of a King</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 21 Balaam also said, Jehovah their God is with them, / And the shout of a king is among them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ultimately, this king refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, the shout of a king among them means that the shout of Christ is among them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>C. Having the Horns of the Wild Ox,</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>and There Being Nothing against Him;</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>a People Rising Up like a Lioness</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>and Lifting Themselves Up like a Lion</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 22 speaks of God bringing His people out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This verse also says that Israel has the horns of the wild ox.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 23 says that there is neither enchantment nor divination against Israel, for now it shall be said of Jacob / And of Israel, What has God wrought!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The second parable concludes in verse 24, saying, See, a people rises up like a lioness, / And like a lion they lift themselves up.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>/ They shall not lie down until they eat the prey / And drink the blood of the slain.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The lioness, the lion, and the horns of the wild ox all refer to the fighting power of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE THIRD PARABLE</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the second parable, Balak said, Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there. v. 27 . Then Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor v. 28 . Balaam said to Balak, Build me seven altars here, and have seven bulls and seven rams ready for me here.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And Balak did just as Balaam had said, and he offered up a bull and a ram on each altar vv.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he did not go as at the other times to meet with enchantments 24:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, Balaam set his face toward the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes, and the Spirit of God came upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And he took up his parable and said, Balaam the son of Beor declares, / And the man whose eye is opened declares; / He declares, he who hears the words of God, / Who sees the vision of the All-sufficient One, / Falling down, but having his eyes uncovered vv.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Falling down, but having his eyes uncovered indicates that he cooperated with God in the third parable.</S>
