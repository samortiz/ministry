A city is not created; it is built. In Genesis 2 we have creation; in Revelation 21 and 22 we have the building. In the city we also have the tree of life. Thus, the Bible begins and ends with life. Moreover, in the city we find a river of living water proceeding out of the throne of God. This corresponds to the river in the garden. Furthermore, in Revelation we find the three categories of precious materials, not in a natural state, but built into a city made with gold, pearl, and precious stones. Therefore, what was sown in Genesis as a seed is reaped in Revelation as the harvest. The growth of the seed and the development of the crop are found between Genesis and Revelation. This is not our human concept; it is the revelation of the divine Word found in the first and last chapters of the Bible.</P><P>In the beginning of the Bible we can see a garden. At the end of the Bible we see a city. Between the garden and the city a long process must transpire, and a great deal of work must be accomplished. Nevertheless, the seed sown in the garden becomes the harvest in the city. This seed includes the tree of life, a river of water, and the three precious materials. At the time of harvest in Revelation, the materials are no longer in a natural state, but become a building fitly joined together. The New Jerusalem is a building of gold, pearl, and precious stones.</P><P>If we read Revelation 21 and 22 carefully, we will see the entire city of New Jerusalem is a mountain of gold. It is not an edifice of clay. This golden mountain is also a golden city. Thus, the gold is the site, the ground for the building of the city. The precious stones are built into the wall of the New Jerusalem, and every gate in this wall is a large pearl. The site of the New Jerusalem is gold, the wall is composed of precious stones, and each of the twelve gates is a pearl. Therefore, this city is a composition of the precious materials found in a natural state in the garden. In Genesis the precious substances are lying in the garden; in Revelation they are built into a city.</P><P>This is not my interpretation. Between Genesis and Revelation we have 1 Corinthians. In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul says that as a masterbuilder he laid the unique foundation, Jesus Christ, and that we all must take heed how we build upon it. What materials are we using in building up the church? Paul tells us to build with gold, silver, and precious stones. (Later we will see why he substituted silver for pearl.) By this we can see that not only the New Jerusalem is built with gold, pearl, and precious stones, but even the church in this age must be built with gold, silver, and precious stones, not with wood, grass, and straw. As we shall see, gold contrasts with wood, silver opposes grass, and precious stones are versus straw.</P><P>When I saw this as a young Christian, I was excited. I saw a garden in Genesis 2 with precious materials. I saw a city in Revelation built with these same materials. Between Genesis and Revelation I saw a church built with gold, silver, and precious stones. I saw that the church is a composition of all the redeemed people, and that this composition is a building. Who are the gold, silver, and stones? You and I. We, God's redeemed people, are the materials for His spiritual building.</P><P>In Old Testament times God also had a people, the children of Israel. The most prominent person among them was the high priest who represented them in the presence of God. Whenever he went into the presence of God on behalf of the people, he had to wear two shoulder plates and a breastplate. On the shoulder plates were two large pieces of onyx stone on which were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. On the breastplate was a beautiful setting of fine, inlaid gold, and within this setting were set twelve precious stones in four rows of three stones each. The twelve stones in the breastplate correspond to the number twelve in the New Jerusalem. The number twelve both in the city and on the breastplate is composed of four times three. For instance, the breastplate has four rows with three stones in a row, and the city has four sides with three gates on each side, giving a total number of twelve in both the breastplate and the city. Thus, the number of the stones on the breastplate of the high priest was the number of the New Jerusalem. Furthermore, on these twelve stones were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. In Revelation 21 we find the names of these twelve tribes on the twelve gates of the city. This is very significant.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_076.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_078.html">Next</a> </body></html>
