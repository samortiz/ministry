   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we want to boast in Christ and want Him to boast in us, if we want to glory in Christ Jesus in our experience, we must, on one hand, receive the circumcision of the cross and, on the other hand, learn to worship in the Holy Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>May God be gracious to us so that we will look down on ourselves more and more, rely less and less on ourselves, and realize more and more deeply how absolutely useless we are.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>May we have absolutely no confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the real death.</S>
