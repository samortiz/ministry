   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANOINTED WITH THE ELEMENTS OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 John 2 we see that Jesus, Christ, the Son, the Father, and the Spirit who is the anointing are all one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jesus is the Man, the Redeemer, and the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the anointed One, the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is also the resurrected One, the Lord, and the Master.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With Jesus we have incarnation, human living, and crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With Christ we have anointing, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, the Father is the source of life, the Son is life expressed, and the Spirit is life flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All are included in the all-inclusive Person, and all have been compounded into one ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was the reason we spent much time to consider all the ingredients of the compound Spirit as typified by the compounded ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have seen that in this ointment there are ten ingredients: the only God, typified by the one hin of olive oil; the Triune God, signified by the three units of the measure of the four spices; the Man Jesus, a creature of God with respect to His humanity, typified by the four spices of the plant life; the precious death of Christ, typified by the flowing myrrh; the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ s death, signified by the fragrant cinnamon; the precious resurrection of Christ, indicated by the fragrant calamus; the power of Christ s resurrection, typified by the repellent cassia; the mingling of divinity with humanity, seen in the blending of the olive oil with the four spices; the power for responsibility, shown by the five elements of the compounded ointment and the three times five hundred shekels of the four spices; and the building element, seen in the numbers five and three.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these ingredients have been compounded to produce the compound Spirit, the anointing in 1 John 2:20 and 27.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapter two of his first Epistle the apostle John was innoculating the believers against any heresy, even a partial heresy concerning the all-inclusive Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even a partial heresy is antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As he was innoculating the believers against heresy, John used a metaphor the metaphor of the compound ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his writings John often uses metaphors, signs, or symbols taken from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, in the Gospel of John we have the tabernacle and the Lamb John 1:14, 29 , and in the book of Revelation we have the lampstand, the hidden manna, the tree of life and the tabernacle Rev 1:12; 2:7, 17; 21:3; 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we see that in 1 John 2 he uses a unique metaphor the compounded ointment, oil compounded with four spices to portray an all-inclusive Person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit is now anointing us with all the elements of this Person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is anointing us with every part, aspect, element, and ingredient.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may use the matter of painting a wall as an illustration of the anointing of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose you are painting a wall with oil-based paint, paint that is a compound of oil and other elements.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When this paint is applied to a wall, all the elements in the paint are applied also.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In like manner, we may say that as the compound Spirit anoints us, He is painting us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He paints us with all the elements of this all-inclusive Person: the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Man Jesus, Christ s divinity and humanity, and His incarnation, living, death, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have already pointed out what Jesus, Christ, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit include.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jesus includes incarnation, human living, human suffering, and crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ includes the anointed One, resurrection, Lordship, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Father includes the source of life; the Son, the expression of life; and the Spirit, the imparting, or giving, of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All these elements are included in the compound Spirit with which we are being anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Day by day, the compound Spirit is anointing us with all these ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter two of 1 John we see the elements of the compound Spirit: Jesus, Christ, the Son, the Father, and the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What these titles include is immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The function of the compound Spirit is to anoint us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the ointment of the Spirit works within us, it becomes the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because the ointment has been compounded, the anointing also has been compounded.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Using again the illustration of painting a wall, we may say that when we paint a wall with oil-based paint, we do not paint the wall merely with oil, but with all the ingredients contained in this paint.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, when we are painted with the divine paint, we are painted with all the ingredients included in it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today the compound Spirit is anointing us with all the elements of the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May this matter be clearly understood and richly experienced by all of us.</S>
