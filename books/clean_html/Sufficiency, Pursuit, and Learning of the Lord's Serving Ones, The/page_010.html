<h2 class="head3">The Revelation of Christ and the Church<br />
in the Epistles</h2>
<p>Many verses in the New Testament refer to God&rsquo;s work of new creation. Romans 8:28-29 says, &ldquo;We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; God causes all things to work together so that we may be conformed to the image of His Son.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:10-11 says that the believers &ldquo;have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew...but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; The new man is created in God&rsquo;s image. In the new man there is no room for the old creation, for Christ is everything. God desires to work Christ into the believers so that they will have the image of Christ. The new man is the church.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we &ldquo;are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; Transformation in this verse is not mainly for individuals but for the church, the corporate new man. Every saint is being transformed, and this transformation is corporate. Philippians 3:21 says that the Lord Jesus Christ &ldquo;will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.&rdquo; First John 3:2 says that when the Lord &ldquo;is manifested, we will be like Him.&rdquo; When Christ returns, we will be like Him.</p>
<p>According to the above verses, Christ and the church are the central thought behind God&rsquo;s creation of man in His image. Christ is the model, and the church is a corporate man, a new man, created by God according to Christ and in Christ. This new man, which is not of the old creation but of the new creation, is the church, the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In the beginning of Revelation God has the appearance of a jasper stone (4:3). At the end of Revelation the New Jerusalem has the glory of God; her light is like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal (21:11). The New Jerusalem, the ultimate expression of the church, is like a jasper stone, which is the appearance of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Clear Vision of Christ and the Church</h2>
<p>The center and goal of God&rsquo;s work in the universe is to create a new man in Christ, according to Christ, and with Christ as the model. This new man is not man in the old creation but the man in the new creation. The new creation is the church of Christ, and the church is the central meaning of God&rsquo;s creation of man in His own image. God created man in His image, that is, in the image of Christ, for the new creation, not the old creation. God desires that we put off the old man of the old creation and be transformed into the new man of the new creation. This new man is not an individual but a corporate man. This corporate man is the church, the counterpart of Christ. This corporate man is also a city, the dwelling place of God, the habitation of God. This is what God intends to accomplish in us.</p>
<p>Genesis 1 speaks of man being created in the image of God. Chapter 2 speaks of the need for man to let God come into him to be his life. Hence, chapter 2 shows the tree of life (v. 9), which indicates that God must be received as food into man to be man&rsquo;s life so that man can become God&rsquo;s counterpart, the church. Chapter 1 presents God&rsquo;s purpose and His image, but chapter 2 presents life. At the end of chapter 2 there is a couple (vv. 18-25). This picture points to Christ with the church. This is the vision of the entire Bible.</p>
<p>The rest of the Old Testament presents the relationships between husband and wife, between the priests and the tabernacle, between the kings and the people, and between the prophets and the people. These relationships point to Christ and the church. In the beginning of the New Testament God was conceived in the womb of a virgin and born of her through the Holy Spirit. People called this child Emmanuel, which means &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (Matt. 1:23). Later, chapter 16 says that this Emmanuel-God will build His church on the rock, which is the revelation concerning Himself (v. 18). Christ and the church are a great vision in the Bible. I hope that we will spend time to study this item of the truth in the Bible and that we would have a clear and thorough view and understanding of this vision&mdash;Christ and the church. Then we will drop our spiritual longings and live and serve according to the central revelation of the Bible.</p>
