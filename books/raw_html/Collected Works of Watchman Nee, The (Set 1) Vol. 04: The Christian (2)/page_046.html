<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>APPENDIXâ€”<br>FULFILLMENT IN HISTORY</H2><P>This church had committed three mistakes: (1) forgetting the Lord's power and His presence; for this reason, the Lord reminded them that He had the seven stars in His right hand and was walking in the midst of the seven lampstands; (2) forsaking the first love; and (3) looking to a human leader. Although they were saved temporarily from the Nicolaitans, they eventually failed.</P><P>This church represents the church after the age of the apostles. When we study history and consider the conditions then, we will realize that it was exactly as our Lord had described. A few decades ago some people found a book called The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles. It was written approximately ten or twenty years after the writing of Revelation. In it was a portion that quoted a prayer used at the Lord's supper then. It says, "May grace descend! May the world go by! Hosanna to the God of David! All those who are holy, come. All those who are not holy, repent. The Lord comes quickly. Amen."</P><P>We see that the church at that time had not forsaken the two ceremonies that the Lord had established. The two groups of workers, the elders and the deacons, still continued to hold their offices. They had orthodox faith concerning the hope of the Lord's coming, concerning the great tribulation, and concerning Antichrist, etc. However, there was no mention of the blood. In particular, there was a passage that said, "If you have wealth, give with your own hands, that your soul may have its ransom." This is a heresy. How deeply they had fallen! This is a complete departure from the first love.</P><P>Twelve years after John wrote Revelation, one "father" of that time, Ignatius, also wrote to the church in Ephesus. From that letter we can see that by then the church had left the system established by Christ and the apostles. Originally, overseers and elders were the same group of people. There was no such thing as one man ruling one church or many churches. We have mentioned this point before. However, the Nicolaitans were raised up. They changed the Lord's system, gave special authority to the workers, and established a sect. Ignatius did not stop this. On the contrary, he encouraged this from the side. In chapter six of his book, it was mentioned, "Hence, it is very obvious that as we honor the Lord Himself, we should also honor the bishop." Notice the word bishop here is singular. This shows us the beginning of the one-man-rule. This is not only true with Ephesus; all the churches of that day were under this snare. Hence, when Ignatius wrote to the Manicheans, he said, "As the Lord would not do anything apart from the Father, in the same way, you [the elders, deacons, or the members] should not do anything apart from the bishop."</P><P>By this we can see how the church then had left the first love. They had followed the example of the Israelites and had set up a king to rule over them. They looked more to a human leader than to Christ the Head. Because there were differences in opinion among the human leaders, many denominations were produced. They had forgotten that the mutual bond between the churches lies in the Lord who was among them. This lack of a unity in form and of a human leader was unbearable to their flesh. For this reason they established councils and nominated bishops as a way to imitate the worldly organizations. This is why the Lord revealed Himself as the Lord with the seven stars in His right hand, who walked among the seven lampstands. It is a pity that the Lord's words had fallen on stony ears!</P>
