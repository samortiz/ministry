        <h2 class="head2">The Revelation in Colossians Being<br />
Christ as the Mystery of God</h2>
<p>The mystery revealed in the New Testament first concerns the mystery of God, which is Christ. Most people agree that Jesus Christ stands out in the history of mankind and that He is transcendent and unrivaled. Opposers, unbelievers, and believers admit that His human living was outstanding. Some know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who became a man. Others know that He was crucified and resurrected from the dead. However, the New Testament says much more than this. For example, the four short chapters of the book of Colossians give an all-inclusive, deep, and vast description of Christ.</p>
<p>Colossians says that Christ is the mystery of God. God Himself is a mystery. He is real and living, but no one has ever seen Him. The best scientists acknowledge that the laws and principles of the universe speak of the existence of a Creator who rules the universe. Scientists have confirmed that there is a system in the universe, a force, that holds all the galaxies together. This is confirmed by Colossians 1, which says that Christ is the centrality and the universality of all things and that all things cohere in Him (v. 17). All things are held together by the mutual interaction of two opposing forces, centrifugal force and centripetal force. The Bible says that Christ is the centrality and that He is the universality. Centrality refers to centripetal force, and universality refers to centrifugal force. Therefore, Christ upholds and bears all things (Heb. 1:3).</p>
<p>Colossians also speaks of Christ as the mystery of God (2:2). Christ is the embodiment of God. All that God is, all the fullness of the Godhead, dwells in Christ bodily (v. 9). No one can find God apart from Christ (John 14:6). Christ is the true God, the complete God; only He is God (Rom. 9:5).</p>
<p>Christ is infinitely deep and vast; He is all-inclusive. It is remarkable that such a Christ has become our life (Col. 3:4). This is also a mystery. Every Christian can testify to this mystery: Christ is in us. Today He is our life, and one day He will be our glory. Today we live by Him and live in Him, and one day we will be manifested with Him in glory (v. 4). He is our life today and our glory in the future.</p>
<p>According to Colossians 2, Jesus Christ is our food and our drink; He is our feast, our joy; He is our new moon, our bright beginning in times of darkness; and He is our Sabbath, our enjoyment and peace (v. 16). In other words, Christ is the reality of every positive thing (v. 17). He is our all in all. He should be the daily experience of every believer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Revelation in Ephesians Being<br />
the Church as the Mystery of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians is the sister book to Colossians. Colossians concerns Christ, and Ephesians concerns the church. Colossians has four chapters, and Ephesians has six chapters. Ephesians is two chapters longer than Colossians and contains many items. Both Christians and non-Christians know the word <em>church.</em> However, few people know the true meaning of this word. The most superficial and erroneous understanding is that the church is a Western-style building with a steeple and a bell. The church is not a hall of worship; it is not a chapel.</p>
<p>According to the original Greek, the church is the gathering of God&rsquo;s called people. Therefore, a more accurate rendering of the Greek word would be &ldquo;assembly.&rdquo; The revelation of the church as God&rsquo;s called-out congregation is on the surface of the Bible. Each of the six chapters in Ephesians speaks concerning the church.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 speaks of the church as the Body of Christ (vv. 22-23). The Body is an organism. This is a mystery. Chapter 1 also says that the church is the fullness of Christ (v. 23). The word <em>fullness</em> is not easy to comprehend. A person&rsquo;s body is his fullness. Everyone would be scared if my head were floating in the air by itself. If I were only four feet eleven inches tall, people would say that I do not have a fullness. A brother who is tall and weighs about two hundred pounds has a fullness. His head might not be larger than mine, but he is fuller than I. His fullness is related to his body. The church is the Body of Christ and the fullness of Christ. In the Gospels Christ could be in only one place at one time. He could not be in Bethlehem if He was in Jerusalem, and He could not be in Nazareth if He was in Bethlehem. But today Christ is on six continents; He is everywhere because there are churches everywhere. The church is the fullness of Christ. This is a mystery.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2 speaks of four important matters concerning the church. First, the church is God&rsquo;s masterpiece (v. 10). In the original Greek the word <em>masterpiece</em> means &ldquo;poem.&rdquo; The church being God&rsquo;s masterpiece means that the church is a poem written by God. This poem is full of affection and is expressive and descriptive. The church is a telling forth of God&rsquo;s inner feelings and a description of His intention. Therefore, the church is God&rsquo;s masterpiece. Second, the church is the household of God (v. 19). A person&rsquo;s household is where his desire is fulfilled. The church is the means by which God expresses His love and the place where His desire is fulfilled. Third, the church is the kingdom of God (v. 19), that is, the place where God exercises His authority. Fourth, the church is the dwelling place of God (v. 22), that is, the place where God dwells and makes His home. Chapter 2 reveals four crucial points concerning the church: God&rsquo;s masterpiece, His household, His kingdom, and His dwelling place.</p>
<p>In chapter 3 the second half of verse 19 says, &ldquo;That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; I have studied various authoritative versions of the Bible. Most translators of the Bible do not render this verse accurately, because their understanding and utterance are inadequate. When we let Christ make home in us and let Him work in us, we will be filled with the riches of Christ &ldquo;unto all the fullness of God.&rdquo; The fullness of God is the expression of God. A brother has a fullness, and his fullness is his expression. If I did not have a body, I would not have an expression. My body is my fullness, and my fullness is my expression. Others know me because I have a body. Sometimes we can recognize a person just by his silhouette or by his walk. Similarly, God wants to have an expression on the earth today, and this expression is His fullness. In Ephesians 1 the church is the fullness of Christ. In chapter 3 the church is filled unto all the fullness of God. A person who does not have all his limbs does not have a full expression. I am not tall, but when I speak, my face, posture, hands, and feet express me. Even the way I move my arms and blink my eyes are an expression. This is &ldquo;all the fullness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church is all the fullness, all the expression, of God. This is accomplished by Christ making His home in our hearts, possessing our whole being, and filling and saturating us so that we may be filled with Christ. Man is a vessel to contain Christ. A person who does not have Christ is an empty vessel. However, it is not sufficient to have Christ; we must be filled with Christ. For example, a cup can have water but not be full of water. When the cup is full, the water overflows and is expressed. If we are possessed by the Lord, we will be filled with Him. The more we are filled with the Lord, the more He will overflow and be expressed. Then God will be expressed. The church is the fullness of God, the expression of God.</p>
<p>In chapter 4 the church is the one new man (v. 24). As believers, we have been regenerated by Christ and have become an organism together with all those who have been saved. This organism grows and causes us to love one another and to be joined to one another. As long as we love the Lord Jesus and are filled with Him, we will spontaneously be one when we come together. We will not need to be exhorted.</p>
<p>I went to Seoul, South Korea, not long ago. In ancient times Korea adopted aspects of Chinese culture; hence, Koreans know some Chinese characters. I do not know Korean, but when I was in Seoul, I wrote Chinese characters, and the Koreans understood. Then they wrote with Chinese characters, and I understood. However, we were limited to expressing ourselves with incomplete sentences. Since I could speak some English, and the local brothers could also speak English, we communicated in English. Even though there were language barriers, we were joined as one the moment we met, because Christ is in us. In our meetings in the United States, even though we have people of every color who speak English with all kinds of accents, we are joined as one when we fellowship. The church is the one new man.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 the church as the counterpart of Christ is being sanctified in order to be presented as a glorious bride to Christ (vv. 25-27). In chapter 6 the church is a warrior with the whole armor of God to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy and adversary, the devil (vv. 10-20).</p>
<p>Thus, Ephesians speaks of at least four major aspects of the church, each of which is a mystery. Most Christians know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who died for us and became our Savior and who will return one day. This is true and precious, but there is a mystery in the depths of this truth. This mystery reveals that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all; the church is God&rsquo;s masterpiece, a poem written by God to express and describe His sentiments; the church is the household of God, His kingdom, and His dwelling place; the church is all the fullness of God and the new man to be Christ&rsquo;s satisfying counterpart and to be God&rsquo;s warrior to fight for God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
