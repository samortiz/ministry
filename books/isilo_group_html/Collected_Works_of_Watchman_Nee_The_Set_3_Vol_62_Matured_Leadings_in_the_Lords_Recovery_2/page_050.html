There are still many unclean and impure things within us. Lord, we need Your mercy. Forgive our past shortcomings. May we come to You once again with full assurance to receive mercy and grace for our timely help. Lord, grant us Your revelation and shine into our hearts. Unless You do this, our understanding will not be open even when we have Your word. Open our understanding even tonight so that we will see what we have not seen before. Amen.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH GOD</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Today we will speak on the subject of spiritual feelings and how to walk according to the spirit. The feeling in our spirit originates from the Holy Spirit; when the Holy Spirit moves within our spirit, we acquire a certain kind of feeling. Our mind, however, does not require the Holy Spirit to activate it. It can think and consider by itself. A Christian communicates with God through the spirit. God's Spirit lives in our spirit. We sense the move of God's Spirit by our spirit, and we communicate with Him, know Him, and know His will through this spirit. It is understandable for a person to exercise his mind all the time before he is saved. But it is inexcusable for a saved person to use his mind to replace the operation of the Holy Spirit. If a Christian has never learned to follow the Holy Spirit, he will not know what the feeling of the Spirit is. As the Holy Spirit moves within us and we touch the feeling of the Spirit, we exercise our mind to think and to translate this feeling in our spirit. This is the right way. It is useless, however, if the Holy Spirit prompts us and our mind is still occupied by our own things.</p><p>Many people think that clever ones understand God's things faster, and dull ones understand them slower. But this is not what the Lord's Word says. The Lord's Word says that He will destroy the wisdom of the wise and set aside the understanding of those who understand (1 Cor. 1:19). The Lord places the wise and the foolish on the same level. The wisest mind and the most foolish mind are equally worthless before God. Both need to be renewed. God does not need man to be His counselor. "Who has become His counselor?" (Rom. 11:34). Who can be God's advisor? God only acts according to His own will; He does not act according to man's reasons. God said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated" (9:13). Again He said, "I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion" (v. 15). This means that God only acts according to His will; He does not act according to reason, judgment, or fairness. If we follow God according to reason, judgment, and fairness, we are asking Him to follow our reason. But we are God's slaves; we are nothing but dust. We can only prostrate ourselves before His throne. How can we reason with Him?</p><p>There is no other way than to obey and follow the Holy Spirit's prompting within us. We can only stand on the ground of obedience. We cannot stand on the ground of interference. We cannot be God's counselor. The mind only reasons and argues. It only considers whether or not reason allows and permits something. God does not want us to argue with Him. He wants us to walk according to His will. A man can argue with his friends, but a father of thirty or more years does not need to argue with a three- to five-year-old child. If the child asks why they have to move, the father does not need to give a reason. Our God is far greater than us. His glory is unapproachable to man. Even if He revealed only a millionth of His glory to us, we would have no place to go but to fall on our face and drop our reasons. To follow God, we cannot exercise our reasoning faculty, that is, our mind. We have to use another organ, our spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
