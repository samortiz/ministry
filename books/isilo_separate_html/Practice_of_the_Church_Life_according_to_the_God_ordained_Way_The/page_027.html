Always Rejoicing, Unceasingly Praying,<br>Giving Thanks in Everything, and<br>Quenching Not the Spirit concerning Prophesying</H2><P>Another qualification for prophesying is to be one who is always rejoicing, unceasingly praying, giving thanks in everything, and quenching not the Spirit concerning prophesying (1 Thes. 5:16-20). Some of the sisters quench the Spirit simply by being quiet according to their female disposition. But we all, brothers and sisters alike, have quenched the Spirit too often. The prophesying among us should eventually become a noise. When we speak in good order, the sound is a voice. But when everyone speaks, the sound is not a voice but a noise. We first should practice to have a noise; then we gradually will be able to speak in a proper order so that our sound is a voice.</P><P>We are children of a speaking Father, so we all must speak. Many would say that they do not know how to speak. The way to learn how to speak is to speak. Some have the problem of speaking too little. Others may have the problem of speaking too much. Hence, a balance is needed in our speaking. Nevertheless, we all must speak. The most victorious, overcoming, and successful Christian is a Christian who is a speaking one. The more you speak, the more you overcome. The purpose for us all to meet together is for all of us to speak.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Letting the Word of Christ<br>Dwell in You Richly in All Wisdom,<br>Teaching and Admonishing One Another<br>with Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual Songs,<br>Singing with Grace in Your Hearts to God</H2><P>In order to prophesy, we must let the word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in our hearts to God (Col. 3:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Being Filled with the Spirit</H2><P>To prophesy we must be filled with the Spirit. The Ephesian believers in Acts 19:6 were outwardly filled with the Spirit, and they prophesied. The Chinese version of the New Testament has a note on this verse, indicating that prophesied means preached. To prophesy is to speak for God, to impart the divine revelations to others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. THE PRACTICE OF PROPHESYING</H2><P>The practice of prophesying includes at least five items: exercising your spirit, speaking with your mouth open, speaking audibly, speaking in the proper speed, and speaking with the purified and accurate word. You need to exercise your spirit in a definite way with an open mouth. To speak audibly is to speak loud enough for the entire congregation to hear. To speak in the proper speed is not to speak too slowly or too rapidly. To speak with the purified and accurate word is to speak without any wasted words, avoiding "sea stories."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
