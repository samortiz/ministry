   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEFINITION OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now find out what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most important matter in the Bible is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps the faith that we know of is not the faith that the Bible speaks about.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible mentions faith several hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the only place that gives a definition to faith is Hebrews 11:1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse says, "Now faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word "substantiation" is not a noun in Greek, but a verb that is turned into a noun.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It can be translated as "substantiating."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most English translations render this word as "substance."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only J. N. Darby's translation renders it as "substantiating." In Chinese there is no comparable word for it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Human beings are made with a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can we relate to the material world around us?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We relate to it through our five senses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a man is deprived of the five senses, he will not know anything about the physical universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The world is full of physical objects of all sizes and forms, each having its own shade, color, and shape.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These objects are realized through our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When sight is transmitted into us, we know that all these objects exist in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Colors are outside of us, but they are transmitted into us through the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These colors are the substance that the Bible speaks of.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The eyes substantiate the colors of objects.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the same way, faith substantiates the substances that are in the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may talk to a blind man about colors, and there may be all kinds of colors in this world, but to him there is no color.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This does not mean that there is no color in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It only means that a blind man does not have the faculty to substantiate the colors that objects possess.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today God wants the things that He has accomplished in Christ to be substantiated in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a function of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Faith is a kind of substantiating; it reveals the substance that is in the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Discussing spiritual things with a person who does not have any faith is like a painter discussing color with a blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The blind man may deny the existence of any color.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This does not mean, however, that there are no pictures or colors in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It merely means that the blind man lacks the proper faculty to substantiate the colors.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What are the spiritual things in Christ to you?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is my speaking to you like the painter speaking to the blind man about his painting?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I hope not.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The question is not whether there is a spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The question is whether or not there is an organ to realize the things in the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although a blind man cannot see with his eyes, he can hear with his ears.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If I speak to a blind man about color, and he tries to listen with his eyes, he will not hear anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may laugh at this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is ridiculous because the man has used the wrong organ to substantiate colors.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every organ and faculty in the human body has its special functions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The only organ that will substantiate spiritual things is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is wrong to try to substantiate spiritual things with one's feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why does faith substantiate or make spiritual things real?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is because Christ has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has put everything into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the spiritual world, God does not need you to create "colors" and "shapes"; He has finished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All you have to do is exercise your spiritual eyes, that is, your faith, to substantiate them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The faith that the Bible speaks of is a faculty that substantiates spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A question may arise in our actual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may say, "You have said that I have died, but I do not feel as if I have died.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I feel as if I have not died.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I still have many sins, and I am still very much alive!"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Please remember that our physical eyes can only substantiate physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only faith can substantiate spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Faith is acknowledging that whatever God says is true.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we look at ourselves and try to feel something in ourselves, we will only substantiate the things in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why are we not able to substantiate the things that are in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is because we have used the wrong organ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are seeing with our physical eyes, and we are feeling with our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are not exercising faith.</S>
