   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 10:12-15 is David's request of God.</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 10:14b and 16-18 are David's praise to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The contents of this praise, however, are altogether negative.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said, "Jehovah is King forever and ever;/The nations have perished from His land" v. 16 . He did not praise God for the nations being saved by God's grace, but for the nations perishing.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 6 says that Jehovah "will rain down snares upon the wicked;/Fire and brimstone and a scorching wind will be the portion of their cup."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If this were the case, the earth would already have been destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There would be no possibility for billions of human beings to live on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 7 says, "For Jehovah is righteous; He loves righteous deeds./The upright man will behold His face."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>David said this, but he himself was not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, he was in darkness without any sensation about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was not qualified to say this because he murdered a man and robbed that man of his wife.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a whole, his concept was altogether based upon and entangled with the law and with good and evil.</S>
