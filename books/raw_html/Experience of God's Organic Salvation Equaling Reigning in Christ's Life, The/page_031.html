<h2 class="head2">A. The Apostle Bringing Us into the Blending Life of the Entire Body of Christ<br />by Recommendations and Greetings</h2><p>We must follow in the footsteps of the apostle. He brought us into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ by recommendations and greetings that the God of peace may crush Satan under our feet and that we may enjoy the rich grace of Christ (vv. 1-16, 21-24, 20). In Romans 16 the apostle Paul greeted the saints, one by one, mentioning at least twenty-seven names, including Phoebe, a deaconess of the church in Cenchrea, and Prisca and Aquila. Moreover, he greeted the saints generally. This shows us that he had a considerable amount of knowledge, understanding, and care with regard to every one of them. Such recommendations and greetings show both the mutual concern among the saints and the mutual fellowship among the churches. It is by the churches&rsquo; fellowship in the Body that the God of peace will crush Satan under our feet and we will be able to enjoy the rich grace of Christ. This grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Carrying Out the Mystery<br />Kept in Silence in the Times of the Ages concerning God&rsquo;s Complete Salvation<br />in the Fulfillment of God&rsquo;s Eternal Economy</h2><p>Through the fellowship in the Body, the crushing of Satan, and the enjoyment of grace, we can carry out the mystery kept in silence in the times of the ages concerning the complete salvation of God in the fulfillment of the eternal economy of God for the Gentiles to have the obedience of faith unto glory to the only wise God through Jesus Christ (vv. 25-27).</p><p>We must have the reality of the fellowship and blending of the Body of Christ. Otherwise, regardless of how much we pursue and how simple and humble we are, sooner or later there will be problems, even divisions, among us. Hence, we must be governed by the vision of the Body and follow in the footsteps of the apostle by bringing all the saints in all the churches into the blending life of the entire Body of Christ. This is to reign in life, and by such reigning we give glory to God. This glory is the New Jerusalem, the universal incorporation of the union and mingling of divinity with humanity, in which God will be completely glorified and His economy will be fully accomplished.</p><p>In its conclusion Romans, which gives a general discussion of the Christian life, gives glory to the wise God. This unveils that all the matters discussed in this book are planned, managed, and accomplished by God&rsquo;s wisdom in order that He, the immeasurably rich Triune God, may be glorified, that is, that His incomparable glory may be completely and fully expressed through us who have been perfected eternally by Him and who have become His Body and have been joined to Him as one. The focus of God&rsquo;s wisdom is the working of His Divine Trinity into the three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;of our redeemed being that in His redemption, sanctification, and transformation we may have a full union in the divine life with Him that His desire for the mingling of divinity and humanity, the joining of humanity to divinity, may be fulfilled in eternity. This truly is worthy of our appreciation and worship! This is worthy of our unceasing singing and praise for eternity! We should have this as the center and purpose of both our Christian life and our church life. May all of us who have been chosen and perfected by Him experience His organic salvation in full and reign in His life to be His consummate expression in eternity.</p>
