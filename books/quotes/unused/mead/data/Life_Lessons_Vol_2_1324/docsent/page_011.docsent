   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 "Breaking bread from house to house" Acts 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The early believers broke bread from house to house in every home.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is clear that the place for the breaking of bread was their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2 "When therefore you come together in the same place to eat the Lord's supper" 1 Cor 11:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to this word, the early believers also came together in one place to eat the Lord's supper.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This must have occurred in a larger place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is the sweet and intimate flavor of a small meeting when we gather to break bread in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is also the rich and uplifted atmosphere of a large meeting when we gather together in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The believers may break bread in separate homes or in one place, and this should be decided on by the church according to the need and the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>AFTER THE BREAKING OF BREAD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1 "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes" 1 Cor 11:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who break bread to remember the Lord should be those who long for the Lord, wait for His coming, and love His appearing 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, after we break bread, we ought to live a life of waiting for the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2 "You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and of the table of demons" 1 Cor 10:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here it says that if we partake of the Lord's table, we cannot partake of the table of demons, and if we drink the Lord's cup, we cannot drink the cup of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the text preceding this verse, the table of demons and the cup of demons are the idol sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, after we break bread, we cannot eat the idol sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3 "Let us therefore keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" 1 Cor 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here, leaven refers to all evil and all that corrupts us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament, immediately after they kept the Passover, the Israelites observed the feast of unleavened bread, removing all leaven from their living Deut 16:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The breaking of bread in the New Testament replaces the Passover in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, after the breaking of bread, we should keep the feast of unleavened bread as the Israelites did, removing from our life all evil and all that corrupts us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We would only live a holy life free from sin by the Lord's holy and sinless life, which is the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, to be those who truly keep the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
