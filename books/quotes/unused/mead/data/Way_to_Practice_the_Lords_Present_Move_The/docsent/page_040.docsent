   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO BE FAITHFUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The way to be faithful is to scatter the Lord s word, which is food to every hungry one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord s household is composed not only of believers but also of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who will go to feed the hungry, sinful people?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all have to say, Me!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is good if we have many full-timers in the gospel, but many of us have to make a living by working in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we all go full-time in the gospel, no one could support anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not put our burden upon the church or upon anyone else to support us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul went full-time and was supported by the churches, but quite often no church and no saints took care of him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was forced to make tents Acts 18:3; 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When he was making tents, he was very busy in writing the Epistles and very busy in caring for the hungry ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to follow his example.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was not a professional preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because he made tents, he had a trade, the same trade as Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows us that we need to do a job to sustain our family, to make a living, but this should not be something to occupy us and give us an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must do everything that we can to spread the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many Christians are nearly void of the truth; they have the Word of God, but they do not care for it nor do they realize how much is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this age of apostasy the Lord, by His mercy, has opened up His Word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of the divine riches have been printed and published.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more the riches are put out, the more we should be condemned and burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why do we not go out with these riches?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our edition of the Recovery Version is not as expensive as some other Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It would be wonderful if we could distribute some copies of this version to the Lord s seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all should have the spirit and the burden to spare some money to get some copies of the Recovery Version into others hands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is one of the ways to feed the Lord s people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some of us may not be able to afford to purchase extra copies of the Recovery Version, but all of us can distribute the rainbow booklets.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have many thousands of these inexpensive booklets stored away and we are still publishing them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we would practice this, this will be a base for us to stand before the Lord when He comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>None of us will care for money when we are standing before His judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To save some money and spend it on the Lord s work is to use the mammon of unrighteousness to make friends Luke 16:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you feed others with these spiritual publications, you will surely make friends.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord will reward you, and those who get saved and edified will receive you into the eternal tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, we can go to others with our Bible and read Matthew 24 and 25 to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many Christians need these chapters to wake them up from their stupor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My burden is not merely for a particular area of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My burden is for the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The entire island of Taiwan is ready to be fully evangelized.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church in Taipei recently sent out sixteen gospel teams to surrounding towns, and they baptized nineteen hundred seventy-five people within three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A number of these towns are ready for established churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everywhere the saints went, there was absolutely no opposition to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nearly everyone is open, especially the educated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The island of Taiwan is full of highly educated people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All over this earth people are not content to remain in ignorance or blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more knowledge and education that people get, the more they find out that human life is just vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They have a desire to know the truth, the reality, the real philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The real truth, the real philosophy, no doubt is in the Word we have in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should go out.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we would not go out, who would?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not adequate to raise up, fund, and establish seminaries to teach seminary students.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not up to the standard of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord has given talents to all His slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To one He gave five talents, to another two talents, and to another one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everyone was required to trade, to do business, to make money for the Lord s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to do this, we have to feed His people at the appointed time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every day is an appointed time, a meal time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every office hour is a meal time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is somebody ready to eat everywhere, so we need to be those using the Lord s talent in full.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The five-talented slave made a profit of five talents and the two-talented slave made a profit of two talents.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This indicates that they used the Lord s talent in full, without any loss or waste, so they both received the same reward.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Also, by His mercy and through His grace we must do the best not to beat the fellow slaves, the fellow believers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not criticize or murmur about them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not speak anything negative about them because you do not have the time to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Your mouth was not made for criticizing but for speaking forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To criticize the brothers is to beat the fellow slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This will cause us to be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should also not go into the world to enjoy ourselves with the stupefied, drugged, and worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to be the sober ones.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not dig into the earth to bury or hide our talent.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should have a job to maintain our living, but we should not dig into it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are different from the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I encourage all my grandchildren to do their best to get the highest education, but I do not agree that any one of them would dig into their education just to become an expert.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I also encouraged all the young people in the churches to get the highest education, but do not dig a hole that buries the talent the Lord gave you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We all need to be faithful in the Lord s service.</S>
