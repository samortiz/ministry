   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE FIFTY THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ASIA MINOR AND EUROPE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 16 Scripture Reading: Acts 18:23 19:20</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 18:19-21 Paul made a short visit to the strategic city of Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When he took leave of them he said, I will come back to you again, God willing v. 21 . As we shall see, on his third ministry journey 18:23 21:17 , Paul returned to Ephesus and stayed there for three years 18:24 19:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acts 18:23 says, And having spent some time there, he went off, passing through the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, establishing all the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was the start of Paul s third ministry journey, which ended in 21:17.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE MINISTRY OF APOLLOS Instructed in the Way of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>but Knowing Only the Baptism of John</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Acts 18:24 and 25 say, And a certain Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, arrived at Ephesus, and he was powerful in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 25 the way of the Lord is not the doctrine concerning the Lord, but the practical way in which the New Testament believers should walk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to 18:25, Apollos knew only the baptism of John.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that Apollos did not have a complete revelation of God s New Testament economy, although he was instructed in the way of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, there was a deficiency in the result of his ministry 19:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 26 continues, And this man began to speak boldly in the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him to themselves and expounded the way of God to him more accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Acts the way 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:14, 22 denotes the Lord s full salvation in God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is the way God dispenses Himself into the believers through Christ s redemption and the Spirit s anointing; it is the way the believers partake of God and enjoy God; it is the way the believers worship God in their spirit by enjoying Him and follow the persecuted Jesus by being one with Him; and it is the way the believers are brought into the church and built up into the Body of Christ to bear the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Helping the Believers through Grace</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 18:27 and 28 go on to say, And when he intended to pass through into Achaia, the brothers wrote, urging the disciples to welcome him; and when he arrived, he helped much through grace those who had believed; for he vigorously confuted the Jews publicly, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Literally, the Greek words rendered grace in verse 27 mean the grace, indicating the particular grace which Apollos enjoyed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This grace is just God Himself in Christ as the portion to the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have pointed out elsewhere, this grace is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply so that we may live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, grace is the Triune God becoming life and everything to us.</S>
