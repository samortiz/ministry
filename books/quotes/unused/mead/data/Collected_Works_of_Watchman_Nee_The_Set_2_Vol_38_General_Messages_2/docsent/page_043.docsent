   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRAYER OF THE CANAANITE WOMAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MATTHEW 15:22-28; MARK 7:24-30</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Canaanite woman was in distress, she cried out in her need, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matt 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Was she earnest in prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Truly she was.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But it is amazing that the Lord "did not answer her a word" v. 23 . The disciples seemed to be in sympathy with her because they said on her behalf, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us" v. 23 . But what did the Lord reply to them? He said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" v. 24 . The Lord's reply gave the woman the key to approach Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She saw that the Son of David was related only to the house of Israel, not to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So she came and worshipped Him, saying, "Lord, help me!" v. 25 . She called Him "Lord," not "Son of David." She realized that only the house of Israel had the right to use that title, so she forsook the wrong ground on which she had been standing and addressed her prayer to Him as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This prayer brought His answer: "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs" v. 26 . The answer seemed so cold that it sounded as though the Lord was rejecting and embarrassing the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, He was trying to show her where she stood so that she might know the meaning of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The woman saw her own place; she saw the Lord as well as His grace, and seizing the key to prayer, she said, "Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table" v. 27 . This called forth the Lord's commendation, and He said to her, "O woman, great is your faith!" v. 28 . She had found the key to prayer, and spontaneously she had faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Mark 7 the Lord said, "Because of this word, go.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The demon has gone out of your daughter" v. 29 . Her prayer was answered "because of this word." Her word touched the key to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is what we need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Often we pray, yet our prayer seems to disappear like a stone dropped into the ocean; it goes away without any answer from God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have not found the right key to unlock the door; however, we do not try to discover the reason that God has not answered our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brothers and sisters, how can we expect God to answer such foolish prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In all of our prayers we must first find the key; only as we do this can we expect to have constant answers from God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Having looked at these illustrations related to prayer, bear in mind that as we pray we should heed the inner voice and not be governed by our circumstances, thoughts, or affections.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When that still small voice within tells us to pray, when in the depths of our being we have a sense that we should pray, then we should pray at once.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Circumstances should only be a means of driving us into the presence of God to wait on Him; they should not be our master, and we should not be hindered by them from praying.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our mind should only serve to organize our inner feelings, which should be then expressed in words; our mind should not be the source of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Prayer is the expression of the inner feelings through the mind; it does not originate in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Prayer according to the will of God is only possible when we are in harmony with His will; it is not an exercise of forcing God to oblige man's emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unless our emotions are dealt with, it is impossible for us to pray; prayers will not have a way to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once we are under the control of our emotions, we will pray in a natural way according to our subjective desires; it will be hard to pray according to the inner leading.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we must touch the key to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we find ourselves praying ineffectively, fruitlessly, and insufficiently, we must ask the Lord for light and seek to discover the cause.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we inquire of the Lord, we will reach a point at which we feel that we have gotten through, when something within clicks, and a still small voice within says, "That's it!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have found the key to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we use the key and pray on, we can be assured that God will answer our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Isaiah 62:6 says, "Upon your walls, O Jerusalem,/I have appointed watchmen;/All day and all night/They will never keep silent."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These watchmen are men of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They have to be on watch tirelessly in order to know if something is happening and cry out when it does.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man of prayer must be one who reminds the Lord continually.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not the work of one individual or a few men; there is the need for a group of men to pray this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"All day and all night they will never keep silent."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are companies watching together, and together they discover something, and together they pray unceasingly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their prayers do not cease "until He establishes/And until He makes Jerusalem/A praise in the earth" v. 7 . We must persevere in prayer until the Body of Christ is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God needs our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He wants us to have a spirit of prayer, the atmosphere of prayer, and the key to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brothers and sisters, let us arise and learn to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us seek the key to prayer so that we may meet God's need today.</S>
