   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ALL DISCIPLES BEING APOSTLES, PROPHETS, EVANGELISTS, AND SHEPHERDS AND TEACHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every Christian who is up to the standard is an apostle, prophet, evangelist, and shepherd and teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>An apostle is not a king; he is a sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If I send you out to do a specific task, then you are my sent one, my apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 17:18 the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father, As You have sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The them in this verse refers not only to the twelve Apostles, but to all the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that all who believe in Christ should be sent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is confirmed by the Lord s word to the disciples in John 20:21: As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All disciples of the Lord Jesus, both male and female, are to be sent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have been a Christian for years without ever having been sent by Him, you are not up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we consider our past experience, we shall realize that many of us have been sent to our husband or wife, to our parents and relatives, and to our friends.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Like Paul, we are sent ones, we are apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are also prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the Scriptures, a prophet does not primarily predict the future; he is one who speaks for God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, when Moses was called by God in Exodus 3 and 4, he told the Lord that he was not eloquent 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord said that He would give Aaron to Moses to be his prophet 4:14-16; 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Aaron did not predict things for Moses; he spoke on his behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that to be a prophet is to be a spokesman.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just as we have functioned as apostles, so we have also been prophets, perhaps to our parents, relatives, and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As prophets, we speak on behalf of the Lord, telling others how the Lord loves them and desires to be life and everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more we speak in such a way, the more we function as prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In speaking for God, we also preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that we are evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be an evangelist is simply to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same principle, we are also shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In caring for the ones saved through our gospel preaching, we shepherd them and teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, we are apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To have a walk worthy of God s calling is to be one who is sent by God, who speaks for God, who preaches the gospel, and who shepherds others and teaches them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are not such a person, we are not up to God s standard.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Due to the influence of our religious background and environment, we are accustomed to thinking of apostles and prophets as extraordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But an apostle is an ordinary Christian, a Christian who meets God s standard.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not have a false humility and say that we are too small, too insignificant, to be apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a fact that we can be sent out by the Lord, at least to our relatives and friends, and that we can speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a fact that we all can be and should be God s sent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are of the same category as Paul, although, as apostles, we do not have, of course, as great a measure as he had.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE STEWARDSHIP OF THE GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ephesians 3:2 says, If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do you realize that not only Paul was a steward, but that you are a steward also?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Like Paul, you have received the stewardship of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A steward is a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, a steward or stewardess on an airplane serves the passengers and takes care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that a steward is not some kind of high official, but one who serves others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The service of a steward is called the stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to 3:2, our stewardship is the stewardship of the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all have received a certain amount of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 4:7 Paul says, But to each one of us was given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By receiving grace, we spontaneously have the stewardship of the amount of grace we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By grace we have been constituted stewards.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ephesians 3:2 says that grace has been given to Paul, and 4:7 says that grace has been given to each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the light of these verses, we should not consider that Paul was something that we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In fact, 3:8 reveals that Paul regarded himself as less than the least of all saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that all the saints can receive the same kind of grace as was given to the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As to the person of Paul, he was the least among the apostles 1 Cor 15:9 ; but as to his ministry, he was not behind the chiefest apostles 2 Cor 11:5; 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet, as one who received grace, he was less than the least of all saints.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This implies that all the saints can receive the grace which he received.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This can be compared to all the members of our physical body which receive the same lifeblood, however large or small they may be.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the ability, or the gift, that comes out of the lifeblood differs with the members.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the members of the Body of Christ can have the same grace of life as Paul, but their gifts are not the same as Paul s gift was.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If grace could be given to Paul, who thought of himself as less than the least of all saints, then it can certainly be given to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To Paul, it was not a matter of who had received more grace and who had received less.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to forget all such comparisons.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The important thing is that we see that we all can be the same as the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since one who was less than the least of all saints could be such a person as described in chapters three and four, then we have no excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, throughout the centuries, Christians have been under the influence of the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to this concept, one of the early apostles was enthroned to be a pope.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But we all can be popes in a proper sense, for a pope simply means a father.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This indicates that we all can be spiritual fathers to those we bring to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our mind needs to be purged from the natural concept that uplifts the apostles above the ordinary believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Apostles are simply those sent by God to carry out His purpose for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Certainly we all can be such sent ones, and, having been sent, we all can speak for God as His prophets, His spokesmen.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do not be held back by traditional teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Instead, believe the fact that the stewardship of the grace of God has been given to every believer.</S>
