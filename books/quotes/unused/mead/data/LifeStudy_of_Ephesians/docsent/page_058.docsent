   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE BODY,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE FULLNESS OF THE ALL-FILLING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Triune God is dispensed and wrought into us in the Body, the fullness of the all-filling Christ, that we may be His full expression v. 23 . The result of the sixth item is the producing of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This Body, being the fullness of the all-filling Christ, is the expression of the Triune God to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the ultimate consummation of God s dispensation according to His divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us review the seven points in chapter one which prove that God is being dispensed and wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first point concerns holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The only way we can be holy is for God to be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When God selected us, His intention was not that we wear a certain style of clothing or comb our hair in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to cast aside that concept of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Holiness is God Himself wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to take care of the dispensing of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The kind of clothes we wear should depend on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is living, real, and sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To be saturated with Him is to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, the way to become sons of God is not by improving ourselves nor correcting ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning this, teachings and regulations are of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The only thing that works is having the Son of God dispensed into us and wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The same is true of the redemption of our bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, we shall be fully redeemed by having God saturate us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This redemption is not the redemption by the blood; it is the redemption of our bodies through the saturation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 8 says that this redemption is the full sonship, the completion of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that the redemption of our bodies is the final step in the process of sonizing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is now sonizing us by saturating us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the time of the redemption of our bodies, this work of sonizing will be completed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The hope of glory is also related to the Triune God dispensed into us and wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the commonly-accepted Christian teaching, we shall one day suddenly find ourselves transported into a realm of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the only way we can be glorified is to be saturated with God day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The burden of my ministry is for you to be saturated with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I long for the Triune God to be dispensed into you and for you to be saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This saturation lasts forever; it cannot be eradicated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The glory comes from this saturation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the Christian life is a life of being saturated with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, through this saturation, we shall be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The divine power that is transmitted into us saturates us with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have seen that this power is to the church, toward us who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Greek word translated toward in verse 19 may also be rendered into.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, the divine power is into us who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This conveys the idea of saturation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every part and area of our being is to be saturated with the divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what the Lord is doing in His recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the day we repented, the divine power was installed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now it is no longer merely the power from on high; it is the power within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we open ourselves, this power comes into function to saturate us with the divine essence transmitted into us from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today this transmission is moving within us like the blood that circulates throughout our body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because we are not always open or because we may have problems in our conscience, mind, emotion, or will, the transmission may temporarily be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we would experience a continual transmission, we need to repent, confess, and make a clearance of all hindrances.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then the transmission will be restored and will continue to saturate our being.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is in the dispensing of the Triune God into us and His working of Himself into our being that we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now we can understand why the church is mentioned at the end of chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church is not produced by forming the saints into an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the contrary, the church is produced by the transmission from the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church produced in this way is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The so-called churches are not the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are not an organism; rather they are somewhat like an artificial body, an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church is the organism that comes out of the transmission of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This church, the Body of Christ, is the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What a great matter it is to see that chapter one of Ephesians issues in the Body!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church as the Body of Christ is produced by God s well-speaking, and the basic factor of this well-speaking is that the divine life is dispensed into us and wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church is the issue of God s well-speaking, the basic factor of which is the Triune God dispensed and wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God s dispensation began in eternity past; passed through creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension; and now reaches His chosen ones to make them His holy people, the sons of God, the sealed ones, and the Body as the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Body comes from the transmission of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This transmission is the sum total of God s well-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To enjoy the transmission we need a sober mind, a fervent emotion, a submissive will, and a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through the experience of this transmission, we become the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What we need today is more of this all-inclusive transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hallelujah, the Triune God is being transmitted into us!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, we do not have mere teachings we have dispensation, transmission, and saturation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the basic concept in Ephesians 1.</S>
