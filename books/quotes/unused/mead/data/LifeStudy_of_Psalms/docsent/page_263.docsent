   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As we have indicated, Psalms 90 through 92 are about the saints' deeper experience of God in the identification with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the deeper experience of God is to dwell in God, but what is revealed in these psalms concerning the identification with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To answer this question we need to read 91:9: "You have made Jehovah, who is my refuge,/Even the Most High, Your habitation."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moses, the writer of Psalm 90, took Jehovah as his dwelling place, and the writer of Psalm 91 did the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verses 11 and 12 indicate that "You" and "Your" in verse 9 refer to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These verses are quoted in Matthew 4:6 and applied to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This reveals that not only Moses took God as his dwelling place, but even the Lord Jesus, while He was on earth, took God the Father as His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moses, the lawgiver, and Christ, the grace-giver, were the same in taking God as their dwelling place, as their habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To take God as our habitation, our dwelling place, is the highest and fullest experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To take God as our dwelling place is to experience Him to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Probably no one among us would dare to say that he dwells in God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But this is what Christ did.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He was living His human life on earth, He continually took God the Father as His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be identified with Christ is to be identified with Him not only in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension but also in His taking God as His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are identified with Christ to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A number of good books have been written on our identification with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jessie Penn-Lewis emphasized the identification with Christ in His death; T. Austin-Sparks, the identification with Christ in His resurrection; and Brother Nee, the identification with Christ in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would be identified with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension, we need to abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not abide in Christ, we are separated from Him and thus are not identified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The only way that we can be identified with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension is to abide in Christ, and to abide in Christ is not only to remain in Him but also to dwell in Him, taking Him as our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To dwell in our house means that we have our living there in many different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For instance, I eat my meals at home, sitting in my comfortable seat at the dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, to dwell in God is to have our living in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Often we speak about eating Christ, but we need to see that when we eat Christ, we should be dwelling in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us now consider these three psalms one by one.</S>
