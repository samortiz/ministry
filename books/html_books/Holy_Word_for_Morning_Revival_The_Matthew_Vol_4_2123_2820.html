First, the chief priests, representing the authority of the Jewish religion, and the elders, representing the authority of the Jewish people, asked Him concerning His authority (21:23). Their question was according to their religious concept. Second, the Pharisees, the fundamentalists, and the Herodians, who were zealous in politics, asked Him a question related to politics [22:15-17]. Third, the Sadducees, the modernists, questioned Him concerning fundamental belief [vv. 23-28]. Fourth, a self-approved lawyer asked Him a question concerning the law [vv. 34-36]. After answering all their questions wisely, He asked them a question concerning the Christ. This is the question of questions. Their questions were related to religion, politics, belief, and the law. His question was concerning the Christ, who is the center of all things. They knew religion, politics, belief, and the law, but they paid no attention to Christ. Hence, He asked them, &#8220;What do you think concerning the Christ?&#8221; This question of questions must be answered by everyone.</p><p>When the Pharisees were asked this question by the Lord, they replied that Christ was David&#8217;s son (v. 42). No doubt, according to the Scriptures, this answer was correct. Then the Lord said, &#8220;...If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?&#8221; (vv. 43-45). The question here is how a great-grandfather could call his great-grandson Lord. This was one question the Pharisees did not know how to answer.</p><p>Christ is God; in His divinity He is the Lord of David. He is also a man; in His humanity He is the Son of David. The Pharisees had only half the scriptural knowledge concerning Christ&#8217;s person, i.e., that He was the Son of David according to His humanity. They did not have the other half, i.e., that He was the Son of God according to His divinity.</p><p>Do not think that we can understand Christ adequately today. No, He is too wonderful and too far beyond our comprehension. We do not even fully understand ourselves, much less Christ. Do you know where your spirit is, or where your soul is?...When I was very young, I thought I knew myself thoroughly. But the longer I have lived, the more I realize how little I know. If we cannot understand ourselves, how can we adequately understand Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God?...Jesus Christ is the Son and...He is also called the Father [Isa. 9:6]....He is one person with two natures and two lives. However, it is beyond our ability to understand this thoroughly. We simply believe whatever the Bible says and praise Him for being so wonderful! We need to worship Him, take Him in, enjoy Him, and experience Him as the wonderful One.

Eventually, He reached the point where He did not talk to them any further.

[He exposed their hypocrisy in the following areas: 1) seating themselves in Moses&#8217; seat and saying but not doing (vv. 2-3); 2) binding heavy burdens and laying them on the shoulders of others, but not moving them with their finger (v. 4); 3) doing all their works to be seen by men (v. 5a); 4) broadening their phylacteries and enlarging the fringes of their garments (v. 5b); 5) loving the place of honor at the dinners and the chief seats in the synagogues (v. 6); 6) loving the salutations in the market places and being called Rabbi by men (v. 7); and 7) a behavior that is in contrast to the humility of the kingdom people (vv. 8-12)].</p><p>In 23:13-36 the Lord pronounces an eightfold woe upon the scribes and Pharisees.

Everything found in 23:1-36 resembles the situation today. Remember, this rebuke is found in the book of the kingdom. Matthew&#8217;s intention is certainly to present the negative in order to reveal the positive. The kingdom life must be the opposite of what is exposed in 23:1-36. It must be an absolute contrast to this black and hellish picture. Only by the mercy and grace of the Lord can we escape the situation portrayed here.

Hence, when the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings,&#8221; He indicated that He was God Himself.</p><p>38<sup>1</sup> Since house here is singular, it must denote the house of God, which was the temple (21:12-13). It had been the house of God, but now it was called &#8220;your house&#8221; because the Jews had made it a den of robbers (21:13).</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>After the Lord had been tested and examined and after He had rebuked the scribes and Pharisees, He forsook Jerusalem with its temple. In 23:37-39 the Lord spoke a final word to Jerusalem. After this word, the Lord had nothing more to do with her.</p><p>As the Lord Jesus was declaring this final word to them, He was still like a loving hen, stretching out His wings to brood over the little ones. But they were not willing to be gathered under His wings.</p><p>In ancient times, according to the book of Ezekiel, God left His temple. The same thing was happening here. In chapter ten Ezekiel saw in a vision the glory of God leaving the temple. Thus, the temple was left desolate for the rebellious Jews, and eventually it was burned and destroyed. Here in Matthew 23 the Lord [who is the real glory, the manifestation of God], was once again about to leave the house desolate. Not too long afterwards, the temple was destroyed by the Roman army under Titus. Thus 23:38 corresponds to 24:2, which indicates that not one stone was to be left upon another. Both of these verses refer to the desolation of the temple in Jerusalem.</p><p>The Lord&#8217;s word here is brief, but it includes a number of things from the destruction of Jerusalem until the Lord&#8217;s second coming. Here the Lord made a clear declaration that He, the very glory of God, was leaving the nation of Israel and that they would not see Him until His coming again. Nearly two thousand years have passed since that time, and Israel still has not seen the Lord Jesus. Some may ask, &#8220;Does this mean that the Jews have no opportunity to believe in the Lord Jesus?&#8221; As individuals, the Jews still have the opportunity to believe, but as a nation they do not have this opportunity today. As a nation, Israel is through with the Lord. Thank the Lord that He is still merciful to the Jews. Even though He has left the nation of Israel, the back door is still open for individual Jews to come to Him. Today no Jew has the position to come to God as a representative of his nation. But when the Jews are persecuted by their enemies at the end of this age, they will cry out to their God. Then Christ will descend and place His feet on the Mount of Olives, which will be cleft like the waters of the Red Sea. This will enable the Jews to escape from persecution. At that time they will repent to the Lord and call upon Him, and the nation will be saved. This salvation will be not only for individuals, but for the entire nation. However, before the Lord&#8217;s coming back, it is impossible for the nation of Israel to repent. But, as we have pointed out, individual Jews can still repent today and come into God&#8217;s grace.

In this period of time He willingly presented Himself to the children of Israel for a thorough examination. Then He was crucified on the day of the Passover. This indicates that He was the real Passover Lamb; the lamb in Exodus 12 was a type.</p><p>As portrayed in Matthew 21:23-22:46, during His last visit to Jerusalem, the center of Judaism, Christ was surrounded by the chief priests, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, and Sadducees, along with a self-approved lawyer, all of whom endeavored to ensnare Him by asking puzzling and insidious questions. In responding to the chief priests and elders regarding His authority, He spoke three parables: the parable of the shifting of the birthright, the parable of the vineyard, and the parable of the wedding feast. After answering all their questions wisely, He asked them, &#8220;What do you think concerning the Christ?&#8221; This is the question of questions. The Pharisees replied that Christ was David&#8217;s son. Then the Lord said, &#8220;If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?&#8221; The question here is how a great-grandfather could call his great-grandson Lord. This was one question the Pharisees did not know how to answer. As God, in His divinity, Christ is the Lord of David; as a man, in His humanity, He is the Son of David.</p><p>After the Lord had been examined and tested by all His opposers, in His wisdom He muzzled their mouths. Eventually, in chapter twenty-three, He rebuked the Jewish religionists, first speaking against their hypocrisy (23:1-12), and then pronouncing an eightfold woe upon the scribes and Pharisees (vv. 13-36). This rebuke (vv. 1-36) affords us an accurate picture of today&#8217;s religion. The kingdom life must be the opposite of what is exposed in these verses. Only by the mercy and grace of the Lord can we escape the situation portrayed here.</p><p>In 23:37-39 the Lord forsook Jerusalem with its temple. As He was speaking a final word to Jerusalem, He was still like a loving hen, stretching out His wings to brood over the little ones, but they were not willing to be gathered under His wings. Here He made clear that He, the very glory of God, was leaving the nation of Israel and that they would not see Him until His coming again.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 17 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 24:1-5</h2><p>1 &nbsp;And Jesus came out <sup>1</sup>from the <sup>2</sup>temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the <sup>2</sup>temple.</p> <p>2 &nbsp;But He answered and said to them, Do you not see all these things?

This was to fulfill His word in 23:38, concerning His leaving the temple to the rejecting Jews as their house of desolation. This was equivalent to God&#8217;s glory leaving the temple in the ancient time (Ezek. 10:18).</p><p>1<sup>2</sup> The entire precincts of the temple.</p><p>2<sup>1</sup> This was fulfilled in A.D. 70 when Titus and the Roman army destroyed Jerusalem.</p><p>3<sup>1</sup> To receive the vision of the Lord&#8217;s prophecy concerning this age, we need to climb the high mountain to enter into His presence.</p><p>3<sup>2</sup> The disciples&#8217; question concerned three matters: (1) the time when &#8220;these things&#8221; would take place, including not only the destruction of the temple (v. 2) but also the things mentioned in 23:32-39; (2) the sign of Christ&#8217;s coming; and (3) the sign of the consummation of the age. The Lord&#8217;s word from 24:4-25:46 answered the disciples&#8217; question concerning these three matters.</p><p>3<sup>3</sup> Gk. parousia, which means presence. Christ&#8217;s coming will be His presence with His people. This presence (parousia) will begin with the rapture of the man-child (Rev. 12:5) and the rapture of the firstfruits (Rev. 14:1-4) and will end with His appearing on the earth with the saints. During the period of His parousia there will be the great tribulation (v. 21; Rev. 9:1-21; 11:14; 16:1-21), which will begin with supernatural calamities (Rev. 6:12-17; 8:7-12); Christ&#8217;s descending to the air (Rev. 14:14); the rapture of the majority of the believers to the air (1 Thes. 4:15-17); the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10); and the marriage of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9). (See the chart &#8220;The Seventy Weeks and the Coming of Christ, with the Rapture of the Saints&#8221; at the end of the New Testament.)</p><p>4<sup>1</sup> The Lord&#8217;s answer has three sections: the first section (vv. 4-31) concerns the Jews, who are the chosen; the second (v. 32-25:30) concerns the church; and the third (25:31-46) concerns the Gentiles (the nations). The first section, concerning the Jews, should be interpreted literally, whereas the second section, concerning the church, should be interpreted spiritually, because it is spoken in parables for the reason given in 13:11-13. For instance, the winter in v. 20 is the actual winter, but the summer in v. 32 is a symbol signifying the time of restoration. The third section, concerning the Gentiles, also should be interpreted literally.</p><p>4<sup>2</sup> Some aspects of the prophecy in vv. 4-14 have been fulfilled, and some are in the process of being fulfilled.

In His New Testament economy, God&#8217;s desire and purpose are to bring forth many sons (Gal. 3:26; Heb. 2:10) as His expression. Hence, birth pangs here refers to all the tribulations in the New Testament age, including wars, famines, earthquakes, afflictions, and persecutions, as mentioned in vv. 6-9 and 21. The birth pangs here are suffered only by the New Testament believers for the Lord&#8217;s sake, whereas the travailing in birth in Rev. 12:2 refers to all the travailings suffered throughout the generations by God&#8217;s people in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. These tribulations, along with the preaching of the gospel (v. 14), are used by God to produce His many sons so that He can constitute the church in this age, accomplish the kingdom in the coming age, and produce the New Jerusalem in eternity as the ultimate consummation of the church and the kingdom that He may have an eternal expression in eternity future.

This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole earth for a testimony to all the nations before the end of this age. Hence, that preaching, signified by the white horse of the first seal in Revelation 6:1-2, will be a sign of the consummation of this age. The gospel of the kingdom is a testimony to all the nations (Gentiles). This testimony must spread to the whole earth before the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation.

The mentioning of the Sabbath here indicates that the Jews would still keep the Sabbath after the restoration of the nation of Israel. The disciples, the audience for the Lord&#8217;s word here, had a twofold status, one as representatives of the remnant of the Jews and the other as the New Testament believers, who constitute the church. In the section of the Lord&#8217;s word that concerns the Jews (vv. 4-31), the disciples represent the remnant of the Jews, whereas in the section that concerns the church (24:32-25:30), they represent the New Testament believers. In the four Gospels, in matters regarding outward circumstances, the Lord treated His disciples as Jews, but in matters concerning spirit and life, He considered them New Testament believers.</p><p>21<sup>1</sup> The great tribulation will occur in the last three and a half years of this age. See note 24 in Rev. 11. The great tribulation spoken of here will have Jerusalem as its center and Judea as its circumference, whereas the trial mentioned in Rev. 3:10 will have Rome as its center and the whole inhabited earth as its circumference.</p><p>22<sup>1</sup> The chosen here refers to the Jews, God&#8217;s chosen people (Rom. 11:28).

The lightning here signifies the open aspect, which will take place after the great tribulation (vv. 29-30), whereas the thief&#8217;s coming in v. 43 signifies the secret aspect, which will occur before the great tribulation. Lightning may be considered as being concealed in a cloud, waiting for an opportunity to flash forth. In a similar way, Christ will be clothed with a cloud (Rev. 10:1) in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear, like a flash of lightning striking the earth. Hence, the Lord&#8217;s coming like a flash of lightning will be a sign of the end of the Lord&#8217;s parousia (see note 3<sup>3</sup>). This implies also that the Lord is like electricity.</p><p>28<sup>1</sup> Taken in context, vv. 15 and 21 imply that at the end of this age Antichrist will be the cause of the great tribulation. It is he who will need to be judged and destroyed. All people in Adam are dead (1 Cor. 15:22); thus, the evil Antichrist, who with his evil armies will war against the Lord at Armageddon (Rev. 19:17-21), is in the eyes of the Lord a stinking corpse, good for the vultures&#8217; appetite. Furthermore, in the Scriptures both the Lord and those who trust in Him are likened to an eagle (Exo. 19:4; Deut. 32:11; Isa. 40:31), and the swift, destroying armies are likened to flying eagles (Deut. 28:49; Hosea 8:1). Hence, the vultures here, being predatory birds of the eagle kind, refer undoubtedly to Christ and His overcomers, who will come as a swift, flying army to war against Antichrist and his armies and destroy them at Armageddon, thus executing God&#8217;s judgment upon them....</p><p>29<sup>1</sup> This is strong proof that the open coming of Christ will take place after the great tribulation (v. 21).</p><p>29<sup>2</sup> This supernatural calamity will occur in heaven after the great tribulation, at the close of the end of this age (see note 12<sup>2</sup> in Rev. 6). This differs from the calamities of the sixth seal and the fourth trumpet (Rev. 6:12-13; 8:12), which will occur at the beginning of the great tribulation.</p><p>30<sup>1</sup> We have no way of knowing what this sign is. However, it must be supernatural and clearly visible (perhaps like the lightning in v. 27), appearing in heaven.</p><p>30<sup>2</sup> The tribes here are the tribes of the nation of Israel, and the land is the Holy Land. At the Lord&#8217;s appearing, all the tribes of Israel will repent and mourn (Zech. 12:10-14; Rev. 1:7).<p>30<sup>3</sup> By this time the Lord will no longer be in the cloud but on the cloud, appearing to the people on earth. This is the open aspect of His second coming. See note 1<sup>2</sup> in Rev. 10 and note 14<sup>1</sup> in Rev. 14.</p><p>31<sup>1</sup> After the great tribulation, at His coming back to earth, the Lord will gather together to the Holy Land the scattered Jews from all parts of the earth.

But because of man&#8217;s lust Satan utilizes these necessities of human life to occupy man and keep him from God&#8217;s interest. At the end of this age, near the coming of the Lord&#8217;s parousia, this kind of situation will be intensified.</p><p>At that time [in verse 40] indicates that while the worldly people are befuddled by the material things and have no sense of the coming judgment, some of the sober and watchful believers will be taken. To the befuddled and senseless people, this should be a sign of Christ&#8217;s coming.</p><p>The two men in verse 40 must be brothers in Christ, and the two women in verse 41 must be sisters in the Lord.... Both watch therefore and your Lord [v. 42] prove that the two men and two women in vv. 40 and 41 are saved believers. The Lord would not charge unsaved people to watch, nor is He the Lord of the unsaved.</p><p>To be taken [vv. 40-41] means to be raptured before the great tribulation. This rapture is a sign of the Lord&#8217;s coming (parousia) and a sign to the Jews.</p><p>[In verse 43] householder refers to the believer, and house to the conduct and work that a believer has built up in his Christian life. A thief comes at an unknown time to steal precious things. The Lord will come secretly, as a thief, to those who love Him and will take them away as His treasures. Hence, we should watch (v. 42).

Watchfulness is for being raptured into the Lord&#8217;s presence (v. 42); faithfulness is for reigning in the kingdom (v. 47).</p><p>The household spoken of in verse 45 refers to the believers (Eph. 2:19), who constitute the church (1 Tim. 3:15). To give them food is to minister the word of God and Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church. We all must learn how to minister the life supply to the household of the Lord at the appointed time.</p><p>[Matthew 24:46-47 says], &#8220;Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing. Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions.&#8221; Here to be blessed is to be rewarded with the authority to rule in the manifestation of the kingdom. In the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord will set the faithful slave over all His possessions. This will be a reward to him.</p><p>The evil slave [in verse 48] is a saved believer, as seen in the fact that (1) he was appointed by the Lord (v. 45), (2) he called the Lord &#8220;my Master,&#8221; and (3) he believed that the Lord was coming. Verse 49 says that the evil slave beats his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the drunken. To beat the fellow slaves is to mistreat the fellow believers, and to eat and drink with the drunken is to keep company with worldly people, who are drunk with worldly things.</p><p>Verses 50 and 51 say, &#8220;The master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know, and will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites.

He does not like to live the kind of life that is prepared for the Lord&#8217;s coming. Therefore, when the Lord comes back, He will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites.

On the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to the Lord privately, saying, &#8220;When will these things be?&#8221; The disciples&#8217; question concerned three matters: (1) the time when &#8220;these things&#8221; (Matt. 24:3) would take place, including not only the destruction of the temple (v. 2) but also the things mentioned in 23:32-39; (2) the sign of Christ&#8217;s coming; and (3) the sign of the consummation of the age. The Lord&#8217;s word from 24:4-25:46 answered the disciples&#8217; question concerning these three matters.</p><p>The Lord&#8217;s answer has three sections: the first section (vv. 4-31) concerns the Jews, who are the chosen; the second (v. 32-25:30) concerns the church; and the third (25:31-46) concerns the Gentiles (the nations). The first section, concerning the Jews, should be interpreted literally, whereas the second section, concerning the church, should be interpreted spiritually, because it is spoken in parables for the reason given in 13:11-13. The third section, concerning the Gentiles, also should be interpreted literally.</p><p>In Matthew 24:4-14 we see the actual history concerning the Jews from Christ&#8217;s ascension until the end of this age, the three and a half years of the great tribulation. Before the great tribulation comes, everything in these verses will transpire. The last item will be the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom. The gospel of the kingdom, which includes the gospel of grace (Acts 20:24), brings people not only into God&#8217;s salvation but also into the kingdom of the heavens (Rev. 1:9). This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole earth for a testimony to all the nations before the end of this age.</p><p>The prophecy in Matthew 24:15-31, concerning the remnant of the Jews, definitely will be fulfilled in the last three and a half years of this age, the time of the great tribulation, the second half of the last week prophesied in Daniel 9:27, which will begin with the setting up of Antichrist&#8217;s image (the idol) in the temple (Matt. 24:15) and will end with Christ&#8217;s open coming (v. 30).</p><p>The second coming of Christ has two aspects: one is the secret aspect, related to His watchful believers; the other is the open aspect, related to the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles. The lightning (v. 27) signifies the open aspect, which will take place after the great tribulation (vv. 29-30), whereas the thief&#8217;s coming in verse 43 signifies the secret aspect, which will occur before the great tribulation.</p><p>Matthew 24:32-25:30 is concerned with the church. In chapter twenty-four watchfulness and readiness are covered in verses 32 through 44, and faithfulness and prudence in verses 45 through 51. All of this is related to us. We need to watch and be ready for the Lord&#8217;s coming back so that we may be raptured early. We also need to be faithful and prudent in serving the Lord so that we may receive the reward. Thus, watchfulness is for the early rapture, and faithfulness is for reward.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 18 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 25:1-5</h2><p class="bold">1 &nbsp;At that time the <sup>1</sup>kingdom of the heavens will be likened to <sup>2</sup>ten <sup>3</sup>virgins, who took their <sup>4</sup>lamps and <sup>5</sup>went forth to meet the <sup>6</sup>bridegroom.</p><p class="bold">2 &nbsp;And <sup>1</sup>five of them were <sup>2</sup>foolish and <sup>1</sup>five were prudent.</p> <p class="bold">3 &nbsp;For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take <sup>1</sup>oil with them;</p><p class="bold">4 &nbsp;But the prudent took oil in their <sup>1</sup>vessels with their lamps.</p> <p class="bold">5 &nbsp;And while the bridegroom delayed, they all became <sup>1</sup>drowsy and <sup>2</sup>slept.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>1<sup>1</sup> See note 3<sup>4</sup> in ch. 5 and notes 3<sup>1</sup> and 24<sup>1</sup> in ch. 13.</p><p>1<sup>2</sup> Ten is the major part of twelve (Gen. 42:3-4; 1 Kings 11:30-31; Matt. 20:24). Hence, the ten virgins represent the majority of the believers, who will have died before the Lord&#8217;s coming. The two men or two women in 24:40-41 represent the remaining believers, who will live until the Lord&#8217;s coming.</p><p>1<sup>3</sup> Virgins signify believers viewed from the aspect of life (2 Cor. 11:2). Believers, who are the kingdom people, are like chaste virgins. As virgins they bear the Lord&#8217;s testimony (the lamp) in the dark age and are going out of the world to meet the Lord. For this they need not only the indwelling but also the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>1<sup>4</sup> Lamps signify the spirit of the believers (Prov. 20:27), which contains the Spirit of God as the oil (Rom. 8:16). The believers shine forth the light of the Spirit of God from within their spirit. Thus, they become the light of the world and shine as a lamp in the darkness of this age (5:14-16; Phil 2:15-16), bearing the testimony of the Lord for the glorification of God.</p><p>1<sup>5</sup> Went forth signifies that the believers are going out of the world to meet the coming Christ.</p><p>1<sup>6</sup> The bridegroom signifies Christ as the pleasant and attractive person (John 3:29; Matt. 9:15).</p><p>2<sup>1</sup> Five is composed of four plus one, signifying that man (signified by four) with God (signified by one) added to him bears responsibility. The fact that five of the virgins are foolish and five are prudent does not indicate that half the believers are foolish and the other half are prudent. It indicates that all believers bear the responsibility of being filled with the Holy Spirit.</p><p>2<sup>2</sup> Being foolish does not make these five virgins false. In nature they are the same as the five prudent ones.</p><p>3<sup>1</sup> Oil signifies the Holy Spirit (Isa. 61:1; Heb. 1:9).</p><p>4<sup>1</sup> Man is a vessel made for God (Rom. 9:21, 23-24), and man&#8217;s personality is in his soul. Hence, vessels here signifies the souls of the believers. The five prudent virgins not only have oil in their lamps but also take oil in their vessels. That they have oil in their lamps signifies that they have the Spirit of God dwelling in their spirit (Rom. 8:9, 16), and that they take oil in their vessels signifies that they have the Spirit of God filling and saturating their souls.</p><p>5<sup>1</sup> Becoming drowsy signifies becoming sick (Acts 9:37; 1 Cor. 11:30).</p><p>5<sup>2</sup> Sleep signifies death (1 Thes. 4:13-16; John 11:11-13). While the Lord delays His return, a majority of the believers become sick and then die.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>We have seen that the section of the prophecy of the kingdom concerning the church covers two aspects: the aspect of being watchful and ready and the aspect of being faithful and prudent....In life we need to be watchful and ready, and in service we need to be faithful and prudent....Although both these aspects are covered in chapter twenty-four, they are not covered fully.

[They] will come to help God&#8217;s people.</p><p>Buy [in verse 9] indicates that a price must be paid. Having the filling of the Holy Spirit is at a cost, such as giving up the world, dealing with self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ. If we do not pay this price today, we will have to pay it after we are resurrected. Those who do not pay the price do not have the extra portion of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>The word came [in verse 10] refers to the Lord&#8217;s coming to the air (1 Thes. 4:16), a part of His coming (parousia). Those who are ready must be those who are invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9 and note 1).</p><p>Not know [in verse 12] carries the sense of not recognize, not approve, as in Luke 13:25. The foolish virgins had their lamps lighted, went forth to meet the Lord, died, and were resurrected and raptured, but were late in paying the price for the filling of the Holy Spirit. Because of this the Lord would not recognize them, approve them, for participation in His wedding feast. They miss this dispensational reward but do not lose their eternal salvation.

The believers&#8217; status in relation to Christ is of two aspects: in life they are virgins living for Him; in service, in work, they are His purchased slaves serving Him.</p><p>14<sup>3</sup> His possessions signifies the church (Eph. 1:18) with all the believers, who constitute God&#8217;s household (24:45).</p><p>15<sup>1</sup> A talent, the largest unit of weight, was worth 6,000 denarii (see note 7<sup>1</sup> in John 6). In the parable of the virgins, oil signifies the Spirit of God (vv. 3-4), whereas in this parable, talents signify spiritual gifts (Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 12:4; 1 Pet. 4:10; 2 Tim. 1:6). For life we need oil, the Spirit of God, even His filling, that we may be enabled to live the virgin life for the Lord&#8217;s testimony; for service, for work, we need the talent, the spiritual gift, that we may be equipped as a good slave to accomplish what the Lord intends to accomplish. The filling of the Spirit in life enables us to use the spiritual gift in service (work), and the spiritual gift in service matches the filling of the Spirit in life, that we may be a perfect member of Christ.</p><p>15<sup>2</sup> Own ability signifies our natural ability, which is constituted of God&#8217;s creation and our learning.</p><p>16<sup>1</sup> Traded with them (talents) signifies our using of the gift that the Lord has given us.</p><p>16<sup>2</sup> Gained another five (talents) signifies that the gift we received from the Lord has been used to the fullest extent, without any loss or waste.</p><p>18<sup>1</sup> The main emphasis in this parable is on the one-talented one, who received the smallest gift. It is very easy for the least gifted to mistreat or ignore their gift.</p><p>18<sup>2</sup> The earth signifies the world; thus, dug in the earth signifies becoming involved in the world. Any association, any involvement, with the world, even a little worldly talk, will bury the gift we have received from the Lord.</p><p>18<sup>3</sup> Hid his master&#8217;s money signifies rendering the Lord&#8217;s gift useless, letting it lie waste under the cloak of certain earthly excuses. To make any excuse for not using the Lord&#8217;s gift is to hide the gift.

After burying the talent in the earth, the evil slave thought that all would be well. Little did he know that his master would come to settle accounts with him. Settled accounts signifies the Lord&#8217;s judging at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10) in the air (within His parousia), where the believers&#8217; living, conduct, and work will be judged for reward or punishment (1 Cor. 4:5; Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 3:13-15).</p><p>The coming [in verse 20] of the five-talented one refers to the coming to the judgment seat of Christ. The gaining of another five talents is the result of the full use of the gift of the five talents.</p><p>[In verse 21] a few things signifies the Lord&#8217;s work in this age, over signifies the ruling authority in the coming kingdom, and many things signifies the responsibilities in the coming kingdom. The joy of your master signifies the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming kingdom. This refers to inward satisfaction, not to outward position. To participate in the Lord&#8217;s joy is the greatest reward, better than the glory and position in the kingdom. Here we see two aspects of the reward given to the faithful slave: authority and enjoyment.</p><p>[According to verse 23 the Lord gave the same reward to the two-talented one as He did to the five-talented one.] Although the gift given to the two-talented one was smaller than that given to the five-talented one, the Lord&#8217;s appraisal and reward were the same in both cases. This indicates that the Lord&#8217;s appraisal and reward are not related to the size and quantity of our work, but to our faithfulness in using His gift to the fullest extent. The same appraisal and reward would have been given to the one-talented one if he had been as faithful.</p><p>The one-talented one also, who did not gain any profit for the Lord, came [v. 24] to the judgment seat of Christ in the air. This proves that he was not only saved but also raptured to the air. No unsaved person can be raptured and come to the judgment seat of Christ.</p><p>To be afraid [in verse 25] is negative. We should, rather, be positive and aggressive in using the Lord&#8217;s gift....[Furthermore], the one-talented slave went away and hid the talent in the earth. In doing this he was too passive. We should be active in the Lord&#8217;s work....Merely to keep the Lord&#8217;s gift and not lose it is not sufficient; we must gain a profit by using it....What the Lord has given you contains the producing element....This productiveness, however, depends upon your practice, your exercise of the talent. If you use the talent, it will produce.

At the end of this age, the people on earth will be in three categories: the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles. The word but at the beginning of verse 31 indicates that what is spoken from verse 31 to verse 46 is another section, the section concerning the Gentiles.</p><p>[Christ on the throne of glory is revealed in verse 31.] The Son of Man is the title of Christ in relation to His kingdom, the Messianic kingdom (13:41). His judgment here is a preparation for that kingdom. [Moreover], the coming spoken of in this verse is the open aspect of the Lord&#8217;s coming. It will be the continuation of His coming mentioned in 24:30. His glory comprises the glory of His divinity (John 17:22-24), the glory of His humanity (Psa. 45:3), the glory of His resurrection (John 7:39; Acts 3:13-15), and the glory of His ascension (Heb. 2:9). The throne on which He will sit is the throne of David (Luke 1:32-33), which will be in Jerusalem (Matt. 19:28; Jer. 3:17).</p><p>All the nations [in verse 32] refers to all the Gentiles who remain at Christ&#8217;s coming back to the earth, after He has destroyed those Gentiles who follow Antichrist at Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16; 19:11-15, 19-21). These remaining Gentiles will all be gathered and judged at Christ&#8217;s throne of glory. This will be Christ&#8217;s judgment of the living before the millennium (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1). It differs from His judgment of the dead at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15) and will be executed on the earth after His judgment of the believers at His judgment seat in the air (vv. 19-30).</p><p>Verses 32 and 33...[indicate] that the Lord is the Shepherd not only of the believers (John 10:11; Heb. 13:20) and the Jews (Psa. 80:1; Jer. 31:10) but also of all the Gentiles (Psa. 100:1-3). The sheep will be gathered to His right hand, the place of honor (1 Kings 2:19; Psa. 45:9).</p><p>After the judgment at Christ&#8217;s throne of glory [in verse 34], the sheep will be transferred into the millennium to be the people living under the kingly ruling of Christ and the overcoming believers (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4-6) and under the priestly ministry of the saved Jews (Zech. 8:20-23). In this way the sheep will inherit the (coming) kingdom. In the millennium there will be three sections: (1) the earth, where the blessing of God&#8217;s creation will be, as mentioned in Genesis 1:28-30; (2) the nation of Israel in Canaan, from the Nile to the Euphrates, from which the saved Jews will rule over the whole earth (Isa. 60:10-12; Zech. 14:16-18); and (3) the heavenly and spiritual section (1 Cor. 15:50-52), the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, where the overcoming believers will enjoy the kingdom reward (Matt. 5:20; 7:21). The kingdom that the sheep will inherit consists of the first section.</p><p>The blessing of the first section in the millennium, the blessing of God&#8217;s creation, was prepared for the sheep from the foundation of the world [Matt. 25:34], whereas the blessing in the third section, the blessing of the heavenly and spiritual kingdom, was ordained for the believers before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:3-4).

How to watch and be ready is revealed in the parable of the virgins (25:1-13), and how to be faithful and prudent is revealed in the parable of the talents (vv. 14-30). In watchfulness we are virgins. This relates to what we are. But in faithfulness we are slaves. This relates to what we do.</p><p>Virgins signify believers viewed from the aspect of life (2 Cor. 11:2). Believers, who are the kingdom people, are like chaste virgins. As virgins they bear the Lord&#8217;s testimony (the lamp) in the dark age and are going out of the world to meet the Lord. For this they need not only the indwelling but also the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>To be regenerated is to have the Spirit indwelling our spirit, that is, to have the oil in our lamp. But to have the Spirit in our soul means that we grow in life, are transformed, and have our soul saturated with the Holy Spirit of God. This is to have the oil in the vessel. Hence, Matthew uses the word buy in 25:9, indicating that a price must be paid. Having the filling of the Holy Spirit is at a cost, such as giving up the world, dealing with self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ. If we do not pay the price today, we will have to pay it after we are resurrected.</p><p>The man in verse 14 signifies Christ, who was going abroad, that is, into the heavens, and delivered His possessions to His slaves. Slaves signify believers viewed from the aspect of service (1 Cor. 7:22-23; 2 Pet. 1:1; James 1:1; Rom. 1:1). The talents delivered to the slaves in verse 15 are the man&#8217;s possessions in verse 14. Today the Lord&#8217;s possessions primarily are the gospel, the truth, the believers, and the church. If we do not care for these things, we will not have any talents. Therefore, we must diligently seek the gospel and the truth, experience the truth concerning the church, and have a heart to care for the saints.</p><p>In the eyes of the Lord, it is evil to bury the talent and not to multiply it. The Lord does not care for our argument or excuses. He cares only that the one talent is multiplied into two, two talents are multiplied into four, and five talents are multiplied into ten. Furthermore, according to Matthew 24:45 the slave is to supply food to those in the household. Therefore, the result of our service has two aspects. The first aspect is that others are fed and given rich nourishment. The second aspect is that the Lord&#8217;s possessions are multiplied.</p><p>In the first two sections of the Lord&#8217;s prophecy of the kingdom, the Lord covered the Jews and the church. The third section covers the Lord&#8217;s word concerning the judgment of the nations in Matthew 25:31-46. The Lord will sit on the throne of His glory, the throne of David (Luke 1:32-33) in Jerusalem, and judge the nations not according to the law of Moses or the gospel of Christ, but according to the eternal gospel. This is a matter of God&#8217;s dispensation. Those who obey that gospel and treat the suffering believers well during the great tribulation will be blessed and reckoned as righteous and will inherit the kingdom (Matt. 25:34), but those who do not will be cursed (v. 41) and will perish for eternity.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 19 - DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 26:1-5</h2><p class="bold">1 &nbsp;And when Jesus finished all these words, He said to His disciples,</p> <p class="bold">2 &nbsp;You know that after two days the <sup>1</sup>Passover takes place, and the Son of Man is being delivered up to be crucified.</p> <p>3 &nbsp;Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</p> <p>4 &nbsp;And they took counsel together to seize Jesus by craftiness and kill Him.</p> <p>5 &nbsp;But they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>It is not an easy matter to understand the doctrinal point Matthew conveys in his Gospel. Many of us were taught that the Gospel of Matthew was simply a storybook. However, Matthew is not a storybook, but a book on the doctrine of the kingdom of the heavens. In order to touch the depths of this book, we need to apply this point to every chapter. In chapters twenty-six through twenty-eight we cannot find the term the kingdom of the heavens. However, everything contained in these chapters is related to the kingdom of the heavens. If we spend time in the Lord&#8217;s presence to see the significance of these chapters in relation to the kingdom of the heavens, He will reveal it to us.</p><p>The word and at the beginning of verse 1 joins chapter twenty-six with chapters twenty-four and twenty-five, the prophecy concerning the Jews, the believers, and the Gentiles. Immediately after giving this prophecy of the kingdom, the Lord told His disciples that in two days the Passover was coming and that the Son of Man was being delivered up to be crucified. The significance of the Lord&#8217;s word here is that His crucifixion is the fulfillment of the Passover. This Passover was to be the last. The Passover had been observed for more than fifteen centuries. But now the Passover was to be terminated and, in a sense, replaced. By putting together the Passover and the crucifixion of the Son of Man, the Lord was implying that His crucifixion was the fulfillment of the Passover and that He Himself was the Passover Lamb.</p><p>As the Passover Lamb, Christ was a test to all the people. Throughout the centuries, Christ has constantly been such a test. We cannot be neutral regarding Him. Rather, whatever we are will be tested by Him. We must do something about Him, and we must react to Him. Our reaction will reveal our attitude toward this Passover Lamb.</p><p>Verses 3 through 5 indicate that Christ was hated by the religionists. The chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel together how they might seize Jesus by craftiness and kill Him. Can you believe that religion exercised craftiness in order to kill the Lord Jesus? Verse 5 says, &#8220;But they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.&#8221; Eventually, under God&#8217;s sovereignty, they did kill the Lord Jesus at the feast (27:15) for the fulfillment of the type. This indicates that Christ&#8217;s crucifixion was sovereignly under God&#8217;s hand to fulfill the Passover. By hating the Lord Jesus, the first class of people, the religionists, were exposed. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 783-785)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>2<sup>1</sup> The Passover was a type of Christ (1 Cor. 5:7). Christ was made the Lamb of God that God may pass over us, the sinners, as portrayed in type by the Passover in Exo. 12. For the fulfillment of the type, Christ as the Passover Lamb had to be killed on the day of the Passover.</p><p>In the type, during the four days preceding the day of the Passover, the Passover lamb had to be examined in relation to its perfection (Exo. 12:3-6). Before His crucifixion Christ came to Jerusalem for the last time, six days before the Passover (John 12:1), and likewise was examined by the Jewish leaders for a few days (21:23-22:46). No blemish was found in Him, and He was proved to be perfect and qualified to be the Passover Lamb for us.

A saved sinner would always do this.</p><p>8<sup>1</sup> The disciples considered Mary&#8217;s love offering to the Lord a waste. Throughout the past twenty centuries thousands of precious lives, heart treasures, high positions, and golden futures have been &#8220;wasted&#8221; upon the Lord Jesus.

Hence, she grasped the opportunity to pour upon the Lord the best that she had. To love the Lord with our best requires a revelation concerning Him.</p><p>13<sup>1</sup> In the foregoing verse the Lord spoke of His burial, implying His death and resurrection, accomplished for our redemption. Hence, in this verse He called the gospel &#8220;this gospel,&#8221; referring to the gospel of His death, burial, and resurrection (1 Cor. 15:1-4).</p><p>13<sup>2</sup> The story of the gospel is that the Lord loved us, and the story of Mary is that she loved the Lord.

According to the Lord&#8217;s testimony, Mary certainly received His word regarding this, for the Lord testified that in pouring out the ointment, she had done it for His burial. This was a sign that Mary understood what the Lord had prophesied concerning His crucifixion.

It is also called the Passover (Luke 22:1; Mark 14:1). Actually, the Feast of the Passover was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Exo. 12:6, 11, 15-20; Lev. 23:5). The table mentioned in [Matthew 26:20] refers not to the Lord&#8217;s table, but to the table of the Feast of the Passover.</p><p>Verses 21 through 25 reveal that the Lord established the table at the time of His betrayal....After Judas had gone,...[the Lord established the table with the eleven real believers.] Thus, Judas participated in the Passover feast, but he did not partake of the Lord&#8217;s table.</p><p>Beginning at verse 26, the Lord&#8217;s table is established. The Lord and the disciples first ate the passover (Matt. 26:20-25; Luke 22:14-18). Then the Lord established His table with the bread and the cup (Matt. 26:26-28; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Cor. 11:23-26) to replace the Feast of the Passover because He was going to fulfill the type and be the real Passover to us (1 Cor. 5:7). Now we are keeping the real Feast of Unleavened Bread (Matt. 26:17; 1 Cor. 5:8).</p><p>The bread of the Lord&#8217;s table is a symbol signifying the Lord&#8217;s body, which was broken for us on the cross to release His life that we may participate in it. By participating in this life we become the mystical Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27), which also is signified by the bread of the table (1 Cor. 10:17). Hence, by partaking of this bread we have the fellowship of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:16).</p><p>The Lord&#8217;s blood redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God and back to God&#8217;s full blessing. Concerning the Lord&#8217;s table (1 Cor. 10:21), the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God&#8217;s blessing. Hence, the cup is called the cup of blessing (1 Cor. 10:16). In it are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion (Psa. 16:5). In Adam our portion was the cup of God&#8217;s wrath (Rev. 14:10). Christ drank that cup for us (John 18:11), and His blood constitutes the cup of salvation for us (Psa. 116:13), the cup that runs over (Psa. 23:5). By partaking of this cup we have the fellowship of the blood of Christ (1 Cor. 10:16).</p><p>Some manuscripts insert the word new before the word covenant in [Matthew 26:28]. The Lord&#8217;s blood, having satisfied God&#8217;s righteousness, enacted the new covenant. In this new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings. When this new covenant is given to us, it is a cup (Luke 22:20), a portion for us. The Lord shed His blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion. The blood is the price that Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed that God made for us, and the cup is the portion that we receive from God.

The King can take this pathway, but we in our natural life cannot. Therefore, the Lord must die for us and enter into resurrection for us. Through His death our negative situation is settled, and by His resurrection He is able to be taken in by us and even become us.</p><p>What was Matthew&#8217;s main intention in 26:31-75-to unveil the victory of Christ or to expose the defeat of Peter? I believe that his intention was to present both-each in vivid contrast to the other....In the light of the contrast between Christ&#8217;s victory and Peter&#8217;s failure, let us now consider verses 31 through 75. [Notice that the Lord warned the disciples in verse 31 that they all would be stumbled because of Him.] The Lord was the Shepherd, and the disciples were the sheep who were to be scattered. However, all the disciples said that they would not deny Him. All of them, especially Peter, had the assurance and the confidence that they would follow the Lord to the end, no matter what the pathway might be.</p><p>In His warning the Lord promised that He would be raised up and go to meet with them in resurrection in Galilee (v. 32). He also predicted that, on the night of His betrayal, Peter would deny Him three times (v. 34).</p><p>After warning the disciples, the Lord went with them to Gethsemane (v. 36). Gethsemane means oil press. At Gethsemane the Lord was pressed so that the oil, the Holy Spirit, could flow out. After taking Peter, James, and John aside, the Lord went to pray alone. When He returned from praying the first time, He found the disciples sleeping (v. 40). The Lord Jesus had told them seriously that His soul was &#8220;exceedingly sorrowful, even to death,&#8221; and He had asked them to watch with Him (v. 38)....When the Lord came back after praying the third time, the disciples were still sleeping. In verses 36 through 46 we see a contrast between the life that is absolutely able [to be] for the kingdom and the life that is completely unable....The life we have by our natural birth is completely unable to be for the kingdom.</p><p>In the garden of Gethsemane, the Lord was pressed to be sorrowful and deeply distressed, even unto death. After praying to the Father three times, He took the Father&#8217;s will and was prepared to be crucified for the fulfillment of the Father&#8217;s will.

As far as our natural life is concerned, we are all Peter. For the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there was the need of a man like Jesus. Throughout chapter twenty-six, the Lord Jesus stood in the position of a man, not in the position of the Son of God. In order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, He stood as a man, a successful man, a victorious man, as a man that could withstand any hardship, defeat, opposition, and attack.</p><p>As we consider this picture of the Lord Jesus, we should receive the clear impression that in our human life it is impossible for us to be the kingdom people. The twelve disciples had been under the Lord&#8217;s teaching and training for three and a half years....The Lord took special care to train Peter in a particular way....Time and time again, Peter was adjusted. It is difficult to believe that such a qualified and trained person could take the lead in denying the Lord.... Not even Peter himself believed that he would do this [v. 35].</p><p>We should not read this account merely as a story about Peter, for it reveals that it is impossible for our natural life to enter into the kingdom. Because we all are the same as Peter, we should not try to follow the pathway into the kingdom by our natural life. No matter what kind of mind or will we may have, we cannot succeed. The test will come that will fully expose us. Sooner or later, all of us on the pathway to the kingdom will face the same tests. Praise the Lord that there is still the way of repentance, weeping, and confessing that brings in the Lord&#8217;s forgiveness and His further visitation. For the kingdom, we must have another life and be another person. Only after we have passed through all the tests and have suffered all the defeats and failures will we realize our need for another life.</p><p>Praise the Lord for the strong contrast presented in this chapter! In Peter we see the black, and in the Lord Jesus we see the white. All the way from the garden to the cross, Peter and the other disciples were defeated. Only one man, Jesus, was victorious. Actually, He was not even arrested; He handed Himself over to those who came for Him. Thus, His death was not a matter of compulsion, but a voluntary fulfillment of the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning His crucifixion. Truly, only the life of Jesus is good for the kingdom.

The significance of the Lord&#8217;s word here (Matt. 26:1-2) is that His crucifixion is the fulfillment of the Passover.</p><p>Matthew 26:3-5 reveals that the Lord Jesus was plotted against by religion. The chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel together how they might seize Jesus by craftiness and kill Him.</p><p>Although the religionists hated the Lord Jesus, His disciples loved Him (vv. 6-13). We must love the Lord and grasp the opportunity to love Him. The story of the gospel is that the Lord loved us, and the story of Mary is that she loved the Lord. We must preach both-the Lord&#8217;s loving us and our loving the Lord. One is for our salvation, and the other is for our consecration.</p><p>In verses 14 through 16 we see that the Lord Jesus was betrayed by the false disciple. The idea of betraying the Lord Jesus did not originate with Judas, but with the enemy, the devil (John 13:2, 27).</p><p>The keeping of the Passover and the establishing of the table are revealed in Matthew 26:17-30. The Lord and the disciples first ate the passover (vv. 20-25; Luke 22:14-18). Then the Lord established His table with the bread and the cup (Matt. 26:26-28; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Cor. 11:23-26) to replace the Feast of the Passover because He was going to fulfill the type and be the real Passover to us (5:7). When we see the bread at the Lord&#8217;s table, we need to realize that it is a symbol both of the Lord&#8217;s physical body and His mystical Body. For this reason, when we break the bread and eat it, we have the fellowship of the Lord&#8217;s Body (10:16). Concerning the Lord&#8217;s table (v. 21), the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God&#8217;s blessing. Hence, it is called the cup of blessing (v. 16). In this cup are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion (Psa. 16:5). Moreover, the product of the vine (Matt. 26:29) within the cup of the Lord&#8217;s table also is a symbol, signifying the Lord&#8217;s blood shed on the cross for our sins. His blood was required by God&#8217;s righteousness for the forgiveness of our sins (Heb. 9:22). The Lord&#8217;s blood, having satisfied God&#8217;s righteousness, enacted the new covenant. The blood is the price Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed God made to us, and the cup is the portion we receive from God.</p><p>Following the establishing of the table, the Lord warned the disciples that they all would be stumbled because of Him. Then He was pressed in Gethsemane, arrested by religion, judged by the Sanhedrin, and denied by Peter. Because we all are the same as Peter, we should not try to follow the pathway into the kingdom by our natural life. No matter what kind of mind or will we may have, we cannot succeed. Only after we have passed through all the tests and have suffered all the defeats and failures will we realize our need for another life.

The record of Judas testifies of righteousness. Even the betrayer of the Lord Jesus eventually realized that He was a righteous man and that what had been done to Him was altogether unrighteous. In an attempt to be righteous, he threw away the thirty pieces of silver, for his conscience did not allow him to keep them. This is righteousness. When Judas returned the money, the religious leaders seemed to say, &#8220;We cannot keep this money, the price of blood, for the service of God. It is better that we use it to buy a parcel of land for burying strangers [vv. 6-7].&#8221; This shows that even the religious leaders had a formal righteousness.</p><p>The concept here in chapter twenty-seven is rather deep. In chapter twenty-six we saw a contrast between the life that can make it to be for the kingdom and the life that cannot make it. Now in chapter twenty-seven we have a contrast between righteousness and unrighteousness....This contrast implies that the kingdom of the world cannot stand. The reason it cannot stand is that it is not built upon righteousness....Because of the unrighteousness of the government of the kingdom of this world, Christ was wrongly condemned to die.

In human honor of a high standard, the Lord rested on the Sabbath day (Luke 23:55-56), waiting for the time to rise from the dead.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 812-814; Hymns: #1089, #169 (vv. 1, 3, 5)</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 20 - DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">Matt. 5:10 &nbsp;Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>6:33 &nbsp;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</p><p class="bold">Rom. 1:16 &nbsp;For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek.</p> <p class="bold">17 &nbsp;For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith....</p><p>Psalm 89:14 &nbsp;Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne....</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>[Matthew 5:10, 20 and 6:33] reveal that righteousness is related to the kingdom and that the kingdom is built upon righteousness. We need to be clear about this if we are to get into the depth of chapter twenty-seven.</p><p>In Matthew 27 we see a contrast between man&#8217;s unrighteousness and God&#8217;s righteousness....Praise God that man&#8217;s unrighteousness turned into God&#8217;s righteousness!</p><p>The basic way in which man&#8217;s unrighteousness turned into God&#8217;s righteousness was through Christ....In all of human history there has not been a case in which man&#8217;s unrighteousness has been as totally exposed as in the crucifixion of Christ. As we all know, there is unrighteousness in the judicial branch of any earthly government. But no earthly court has seen as much unrighteousness as was exposed in the case of the trial and crucifixion of the Lord Jesus.</p><p>Second, the Christ who exposed man&#8217;s unrighteousness to the uttermost also bore all the unrighteousness He had exposed....This is like housecleaning....In cleaning a room the dust is first exposed. Then it is swept into the dustpan. Likewise, on the day of the Passover, the Lord Jesus first exposed all the &#8220;dust,&#8221; all of man&#8217;s unrighteousness. Then He cleaned up the &#8220;dust&#8221; He had exposed. Oh, the very presence of the Lord Jesus exposed every particle of hidden &#8220;dust&#8221; in the whole universe. Eventually, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself became the &#8220;dustpan,&#8221; and all the &#8220;dust&#8221; was collected upon Him....Thus, after all man&#8217;s unrighteousness had been exposed, it was borne by Christ on the cross. This made everything ready for the righteous God to come in to judge the unrighteous ones and all their unrighteousness.</p><p>This matter of righteousness is a crucial aspect of the truth of the gospel. This is very basic, for it is our ground and basis for being saved....Through Christ our Substitute, we have already been judged according to righteousness on the cross. Therefore, God must save us.</p><p>Nothing binds God as much as His righteousness [Psa. 89:14]. If God&#8217;s righteousness could be taken away, His throne would be cast down. We can say, &#8220;Praise the Lord! Even if God wants to change His mind, He cannot do it because He is a just God!&#8221; How meaningful this is!</p><p>Righteousness, or justice, is a judicial matter. Love, on the contrary, is a matter of the emotion....Whether God loves us or gives us up, He is not wrong. He also would not be wrong in showing grace to us or in not showing grace to us. Grace is a matter of God&#8217;s wish....But righteousness is a matter neither of emotion nor of wish, it is a judicial matter. A judicial matter is related to the execution of the law, to legislation. God&#8217;s gospel is altogether a judicial matter, a matter of divine legislation....Of course, God&#8217;s salvation is initiated by His love and accomplished through His grace. Eventually, however, it issues in His righteousness....Our salvation has been sealed and confirmed by God&#8217;s righteousness. Now not even God Himself can change our salvation....It is upon this righteousness that the kingdom of God is built.

But after God had judged Christ in full, God&#8217;s righteousness held Him responsible to release Christ from death and to raise Him up from among the dead.</p><p>We need to consider Romans 4:25. This verse says, &#8220;Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification.&#8221; This verse links resurrection with righteousness....Therefore, Christ&#8217;s resurrection is a proof both of God&#8217;s righteousness and of our justification....In the sphere of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, God is the righteous God, and we are the justified people of God. Here we have the kingdom.</p><p>The resurrection of Christ was first discovered by two sisters, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary. They discovered it by loving the Lord to the uttermost. Then they became the first two witnesses of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection.</p><p>The Jewish leaders with the Roman soldiers spread a false rumor about Christ&#8217;s resurrection [Matt. 28:11-15]. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money to say that the Lord&#8217;s disciples came by night and stole Him away while the guards slept. This word from the mouth of the religious leaders was a bare lie, indicating the lowest standard and falsehood of their religion. In verse 14 they said to the soldiers, &#8220;And if this comes to the governor&#8217;s ears, we will persuade him and make sure that you have nothing to worry about.&#8221; The evil religionists always persuade the evil politicians to perpetrate falsehood. Verse 15 indicates that this lie concerning the Lord&#8217;s resurrection was widely spread, as were the rumors concerning His followers and His church after His resurrection (Acts 24:5-9; 25:7).

Now, for God&#8217;s economy of the New Testament the disciples needed to go to the mountain again. Only on the high level of a mountain can we see clearly the New Testament economy.</p><p>Because all authority was given to Him (v. 18), the heavenly King sent His disciples to disciple all the nations. They go with His authority. To disciple the nations is to make the heathen the kingdom people for the establishing of His kingdom, which is the church, even today, on this earth.... Notice [in verse 19] that the Lord did not charge the disciples to preach the gospel, but to disciple the nations....To disciple the nations is to cause the Gentiles to become the kingdom people. We have been sent by the Lord not only to bring people to salvation, but also to disciple the nations. This is a matter of the kingdom. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 826-828)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>19<sup>1</sup> Baptism brings the repentant people out of their old state into a new one by terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ that they may become the kingdom people. John the Baptist&#8217;s recommending ministry began with a preliminary baptism, a baptism by water only. Now, after the heavenly King had accomplished His ministry on earth, had passed through the process of death and resurrection, and had become the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God. This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water and the invisible aspect by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38, 41; 10:44-48)....The disciples baptized the new converts (Acts 2:38) not only into water but also into the death of Christ (Rom. 6:3-4), into Christ Himself (Gal. 3:27), into the Triune God (v. 19), and into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13)....Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord here baptizes people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>19<sup>2</sup> Into indicates union, as in Rom. 6:3 and Gal. 3:27. The same Greek word is used in Acts 8:16; 19:5; and 1 Cor. 1:13, 15. To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into spiritual and mystical union with Him.</p><p>19<sup>3</sup> There is one name for the Divine Trinity. The name is the sum total of the Divine Being, equivalent to His person. To baptize someone into the name of the Triune God is to immerse him into all that the Triune God is.</p><p>20<sup>1</sup> ...Among the four Gospels the Lord&#8217;s ascension is recorded only in Mark (Mark 16:19) and Luke (Luke 24:51). John testifies that the Lord, as the Son of God, even God Himself, is life to His believers. As such, He can never and would never leave them. Matthew proves that He, as Emmanuel, is the heavenly King who is with His people continuously until He comes back. Hence, in John and Matthew the Lord&#8217;s ascension is not mentioned.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 826-831; Hymns: #608, #7</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><p class="bold">WEEK 20 - PROPHECY</p><h2 class="uhead1">Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="4"><li>The King&#8217;s being rejected (12:1-27:66)	<ol class="upper-alpha" start="6">	<li>The completion of rejection (26:1-27:66)		<ol class="decimal" start="12">		<li>Judged by Pilate (27:1-26)</li>		<li>Mocked by the heathen soldiers (27:27-32)</li>		<li>Crucified (27:33-56)			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Killed and mocked by men (vv. 33-44)</li>			<li>Judged and forsaken by God (vv. 45-50)</li>			<li>The effect of His crucifixion (vv. 51-56)</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Buried by a rich man (27:57-66)</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>The King&#8217;s victory (28:1-20)	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Resurrected (vv. 1-15)</li>	<li>Reigning (vv. 16-20)</li>	</ol></li></ol><h2 class="uhead1">Crucial Points</h2><p>In chapter twenty-six we saw a contrast between the life that can make it to be for the kingdom and the life that cannot make it. Now in chapter twenty-seven we have a contrast between righteousness and unrighteousness. Because of the unrighteousness of the government of the kingdom of this world, Christ was wrongly condemned to die. Nevertheless, actually He was rightly sentenced to death by the righteousness of God.</p><p>Pilate, the Roman governor, should have judged Christ according to righteousness. According to Roman law, the Sanhedrin acted illegally in arresting Christ. If Pilate had been just, he would have stopped the Sanhedrin from doing this. Because he was unrighteous and afraid of the Jewish religious leaders, he acted against Roman law. As a result, he released to the crowd Barabbas, the guilty one, but Jesus, he scourged and delivered up to be crucified.</p><p>Verses 27 through 32 show how the Lord Jesus was mocked by the heathen soldiers. He was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, fulfilling Isaiah 53:7-8. Following this, Matthew 27:33-44 reveals how the Lord was mocked by men and killed. They gave Him wine mingled with gall, a stupefying drink, but the Lord would not be stupefied. Rather, He would drink the bitter cup to the dregs. Moreover, when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves, casting lots. Thus, the Lord was robbed to the uttermost by sinners, fulfilling Psalm 22:18.</p><p>By the time of Matthew 27:45, unrighteous men had exhausted their deeds. They had done everything they could. At that time, God came in, in a righteous way to judge this crucified Savior and to forsake Him. The Lord Jesus suffered on the cross for six hours. In the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God&#8217;s will; in the last three hours He was judged by God to accomplish our redemption. It was during this time that God counted Him as our Substitute who suffered for our sin (Isa. 53:10). Darkness fell over all the land (Matt. 27:45) because our sin and sins and all negative things were being dealt with there, and because of our sin God forsook Him (v. 46).</p><p>The effect of the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion is revealed in verses 51 through 56. Hallelujah, His death tore the veil of the temple from top to bottom, shook the base of Satan&#8217;s rebellion, and broke the strongholds of Satan&#8217;s kingdom!</p><p>Afterwards, the Lord was buried in a new tomb by a rich man (vv. 57-66). In human honor of a high standard, the Lord rested on the Sabbath day (Luke 23:55-56), waiting for the time to rise from the dead.</p><p>After God had judged Christ in full, God&#8217;s righteousness held Him responsible to release Christ from death and to raise Him up from the dead. Hence, in Matthew 28:1-20 the King&#8217;s victory is manifested: first, in His resurrection (vv. 1-15) and then in His reigning (vv. 16-20).</p><p>Because all authority was given to Him (v. 18), the heavenly King sent His disciples to disciple all the nations, charging them to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God, that is, to immerse them into all that the Triune God is.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p></body></html>
