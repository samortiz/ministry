	 <h2 class="head2">B. The Mystery Spoken by Paul in Romans 11</h2>
<p>In Romans 11:25 Paul says, &ldquo;I do not want you, brothers, to be ignorant of this mystery (lest you be wise in yourselves), that hardness has come upon Israel in part, until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in.&rdquo; The <em>fullness of the Gentiles</em> refers to the repentant and believing Gentiles. Now is the time for many Gentiles to repent. Hence, the fullness of the Gentiles has not yet been completed. It is continuing at the present time. When &ldquo;the fullness of the Gentiles comes in,&rdquo; according to Paul&rsquo;s declaration in verse 26, &ldquo;all Israel will be saved, as it is written, &lsquo;The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.&rsquo;&rdquo; At that time all the remaining Israelites will be saved. This is the restoration of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Hosea prophesied that in the restoration the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which is immeasurable and innumerable. They will not be merely the people of God but also the sons of God. Israel will return to Jehovah, and He will enliven them after two days. On the third day He will raise them up, and they will live in His presence. When Jehovah turns the captivity of His people, there will be a harvest appointed for Judah. Israel will have a wonderful transformation based on the factor of love in life. Joel prophesied that God desires to bless His land and is willing to save Israel. Jehovah will reign, and the land of Israel will be blessed. The mountains will drop down fresh wine, and the hills will flow with milk. A fountain will go forth from the house of Jehovah, the temple, to water the entire Holy Land. Amos prophesied that Jehovah will rebuild the fallen tabernacle of David, and all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah. Jehovah will turn the captivity of the people of Israel and plant them upon their land, and they will not be plucked up again from their land, which He has given to them. Obadiah prophesied that the house of Jacob will possess Edom&rsquo;s possessions. Saviors will come up on Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau, and the kingdom will be Jehovah&rsquo;s. Micah prophesied that Jehovah will gather and deliver Israel so that when Israel is restored in the millennium, they will eat and drink for their enjoyment in peace. Christ will come as Israel&rsquo;s Ruler, Shepherd, and peace. The remnant of Jacob will be blessed by Jehovah, and they will also be victorious among the nations. Zechariah prophesied that Jehovah desires to restore Israel. He will save His people from the land of the east and from the land of the going down of the sun and bring them to Jerusalem where they will dwell. The children of Israel will be priests to the nations and will teach the nations to worship and serve God. All the fighting of the Israelites will cease. Peace and the eternal kingdom, as God&rsquo;s dominion, will be on the earth from sea to sea. Jehovah God will also pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplications. He will provide the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem with an open fountain for sin and for impurity. Jerusalem will be blessed, and living waters will go forth from Jerusalem. Malachi prophesied that Christ, the Angel of the covenant, will execute upon Israel the covenant that He enacted through His death. At that time all the repentant and believing Jews will become beneficiaries of the new covenant. Christ will also renew, sanctify, and transform Israel to be His priests.</p>
<p>There are also prophecies concerning the restoration of Israel in the New Testament. The Lord prophesied in Matthew 24 that when the branch of the fig tree, which signifies the nation of Israel, becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, which happened when the nation of Israel was restored in 1948, we should know that the summer, the full restoration of the Messianic kingdom, is near. Paul says in Romans 11 that hardness has come upon Israel in part, until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in, after which all Israel will be saved.</p>
