In a case where there are contrary opinions between two different teachers, whom should one obey? How do we know whom to follow without an absolute outward standard of judgment of spiritual authority?</p><p>Watchman Nee: If a man has never touched authority, he cannot establish a proper relationship between submission and authority while abiding by the principle of submission. Those who have touched authority can immediately identify the proper relationship between submission and authority. The New Testament describes those who offend authority as animals without reason (2 Pet. 2:10-12; Jude 8-10). There is no way for an animal to know the relationship between submission and authority. If two dogs are put together, it is impossible to appoint one as the authority and ask the other to submit to the first. When they want to fight, they simply fight. They do not know authority, and they never touch authority. The same can be said of applying the principle of submission to those who have never touched authority; it simply does not work. Once a man touches authority, all problems are solved. As soon as he offends authority, he realizes that he has offended God. It is useless to point out a mistake to a man who has never seen the matter of authority. We have to lead him to the knowledge of authority before pointing out his mistake. Once we touch authority, there is a new consciousness in us. We will not need to resort to dialogues, votes, elections, and consensus. Those who know authority are no longer like animals without reason. We cannot be hasty in our work. We have to bring others slowly and gradually under the rule of authority. This means that we must experience these things first; we first must touch authority ourselves.</p><p>In the church those who have the gift of teaching should give themselves to coordination in the Body. If a person functions as a teacher independently, it is easy for him to develop a spirit of rebellion. If we take care of the matter of coordination, things will turn out well even if there are few gifts among us. If we do not take care of coordination, however, a great gift will become a source of trouble and even a tool for rebellion. Among the elders there are always some who are more senior and more respected than others. They are the ones who should take the lead. There are also apostles who are appointed by God. But even among the apostles, there are great ones and small ones, renowned ones and not so renowned ones. Even among the twelve apostles there were differences in rank; some were leaders to the others. There is an explicit injunction in the Bible to submit to elders and apostles. However, nothing is legal among us. We cannot say that we cannot find our deputy authority because God has not explicitly pointed him out to us. If we have not met or found our deputy authority, it simply means that we are, in Peter's words, animals without reason. No remark can be stronger than this one. If someone wants to offend authority, let him offend; but as for us, we choose to submit absolutely. The Lord rebukes the antagonizers. They either fall down or slide back. If they remain in the church, we can ignore them, mark them out, and refuse to communicate with them. God will eventually prevail, and the brothers and sisters will eventually take this way.</p><p>The church can fail no longer. We should never say that the church has failed and that we will wait for the next thing to happen to rectify the situation. The church must arrive at the glory and victory of Ephesians 4 and 5. We must believe this. If the church continues to fail, what will happen to it? The kingdom will not come in to rectify the church's failure. Rather, the victory of the church ushers in the kingdom. Eventually, this victory will be extended to the world and then to the entire universe. May God set us firmly on this ground so that we never fail. If the brothers and sisters are willing to take this word, we have a way to go on. If they are not willing to take this word, we still must go on. We have to turn the whole church around so that everyone touches authority. May God prepare their hearts to be good soil. When we return to our localities, we have to find the time to pray with three or five brothers and sisters and help each one of them deal with the matter of authority and settle it. If they do not settle it now, they will not have a way to go on later. If we do not settle this matter here on the mountain, we should not leave here. We have to settle this matter right here and not postpone it. Even if we say that we cannot get through, we still have to get through. We have to force ourselves to get through in this matter. We have to be bold and strong before the Lord and be very clear about this way. We all have to make it; we should not allow anyone to say that he cannot make it. If we delay the Lord's time, I am afraid we will have to wait for another twenty years. The Lord does not have that much time. The Bible is being fulfilled, and the church will arrive at the oneness of the faith. It will reach that state. Some have asked, "What if the church cannot reach that state?" We cannot ask this. We cannot let go. My purpose for bringing us here is to get through; we cannot fail. We cannot have one part which gets through and another part which fails. The church is the final work of God on earth today. We should consider ourselves to be the final work. There will be no one after us. For this reason we must succeed.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_082.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_084.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 59: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (1) &nbsp; pg 83</div><br></body></html>
