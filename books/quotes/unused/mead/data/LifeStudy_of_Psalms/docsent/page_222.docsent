   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Psalmist's Expression</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>from His Complex Sentiments</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>concerning His Enemies</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even in such a good psalm concerning Christ, there is a portion that falls short of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am referring to Psalm 69:22-24, 27-28, verses which are the psalmist's expression from his complex sentiments concerning his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A PRAYER OF THE PSALMIST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psalm 70 is a prayer of the psalmist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. The Psalmist's Seeking for God's Deliverance</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verses 1, 4, and 5 the psalmist seeks for God's deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is surely nothing wrong with this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the contrary, here we have a good example of seeking God's deliverance, His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 1 the psalmist prays, "O God, hasten to deliver me;/O Jehovah, hasten to help me."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This prayer is quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verses 4 and 5 the psalmist continues his prayer, saying, "May all those who seek You/Be glad and rejoice in You;/And may those who love Your salvation/Say continually,/May God be magnified!/But I am poor and needy;/O God, hasten to me./You are my help and my Deliverer;/O Jehovah, do not delay."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. The Psalmist's Expression</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>from His Complex Sentiments</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>concerning His Enemies</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"May those who seek my life/Be put to shame and confounded;/May those who take delight in my misfortune/Be turned back and humiliated;/May those who say, Aha!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Aha!/Turn away because of their shame" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These verses, which surely are inferior to the prayer for deliverance in verses 1, 4, and 5, are another instance of the psalmist's expression from his complex sentiments concerning his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>David found it very difficult to forget his enemies.</S>
