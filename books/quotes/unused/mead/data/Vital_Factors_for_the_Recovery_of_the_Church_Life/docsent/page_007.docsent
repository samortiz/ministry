   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE FACTOR OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE FACTOR OF THE DIVINE LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:2; John 1:29; Rom 8:3; 2 Cor 5:21; John 3:14; Heb 2:14; 1 Cor 15:45; Col 1:15; Eph 2:14-15; Gen 1:2; 2:7-8; Luke 1:35; 4:1; John 7:39; 2 Cor 3:17; John 20:22; Acts 2:33</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous chapter we covered the first factor which is vital to the recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This factor is Christ, the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this chapter we will cover two additional factors the factor of the Spirit and the factor of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, and life is the divine life, the eternal, uncreated life of God 1 John 1:2; Eph 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before covering these two factors, however, I would like to say something further concerning Christ s death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>CHRIST DYING ON THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>WITH A SEVENFOLD QUALIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ died on the cross with a sevenfold qualification: He was the Lamb of God; He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin; He was in the form of a brass serpent; He was the last Adam, the last of mankind; He was the Firstborn, the first item, of all God s creatures; He was the Peacemaker; and He was a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These are the seven qualifications with which Christ died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Among Christians it is commonly taught that Christ died on the cross as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is absolutely correct, but it is too general.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ died as our Redeemer, but what does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was very young I heard this kind of teaching and even preached this kind of gospel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, I did not know what it meant to say that Christ died as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I only understood that Christ was our Redeemer to save us from God s judgment and from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But after I was saved, I spent a great deal of time studying the Bible concerning Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have studied this matter for approximately fifty years, and I have come to the conclusion that, according to the complete word of God in the Bible, Christ died on the cross as seven items.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ died on the cross not only as one item our Redeemer but as seven items.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, Christ died on the cross as the Lamb of God to take away our sin John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second, He died on the cross in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, He died on the cross in our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fact that Christ died on the cross in the likeness of the flesh of sin means that He died in our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The flesh of sin actually denotes sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To say that we are the flesh of sin means that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ died on the cross in the likeness of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He Himself was not a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He knew no sin 2 Cor 5:21 and He had no sin Heb 4:15 , yet He died in the likeness of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, third, Christ died in the form of a brass serpent John 3:14; Num 21:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When He was crucified on the cross, in the eyes of God He was a brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He died in the form of a brass serpent to destroy the old serpent, Satan, the Devil Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fourth, Christ died on the cross as the last Adam, the last of mankind 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fifth, He died as the Firstborn of all creation, the first item of all the creatures Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since Christ became a man, He surely was a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the eyes of God, Christ as a man was considered the first item of all the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He died as the first of the creatures to terminate all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, sixth, Christ died on the cross as a Peacemaker Eph 2:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the Peacemaker, and even as the very peace, He made peace between us and God and between all the different nations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lastly, He died as a grain of wheat to produce many grains for His multiplication, His increase, and His propagation John 12:24 .</S>
