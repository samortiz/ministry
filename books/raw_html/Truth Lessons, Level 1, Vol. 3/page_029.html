	 <h2 class="head1">VII. THE TIME OF BAPTISM</h2>
<p>Once a person has believed in the Lord, he must be baptized immediately and not wait one moment. On the day of Pentecost, when the three thousand received the gospel preached by Peter, they believed in the Lord and were baptized immediately (Acts 2:41). The Samaritans, having heard the gospel preached by Philip, also believed and were baptized (Acts 8:12). The eunuch from Ethiopia believed while on the road, and it was not convenient for him to be baptized, yet he did not hesitate but was baptized immediately after he believed (Acts 8:37-38).</p>
<p>The Philippian jailer and his household believed in the Lord at night and were baptized immediately the same night (Acts 16:33). They were Gentiles who had never known God or the word of the Lord, and when they believed it was already midnight. Yet Paul and Silas, still bearing stripes from being beaten with rods, without hesitation immediately baptized these people who had only heard the gospel once and had believed in the Lord.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the case of Saul, Ananias was sent by the Lord to Saul, saying, &ldquo;And now, why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name&rdquo; (Acts 22:16). Only three days had passed (Acts 9:9) since Paul had believed, yet the Holy Spirit blamed him for delaying his baptism. Today if someone is baptized after having believed for only three days, people may blame him for doing it too soon. However, in this matter we must follow the mind of the Holy Spirit, not our own concept. It is a delay to the Holy Spirit if someone is not baptized after having believed for three days, for the Lord&rsquo;s intention is that a person be baptized immediately after he has believed in the Lord, without waiting even a moment.</p>
<p>Therefore, concerning baptism, we must be recovered to the extent that the water of baptism always follows the preaching of the gospel. Once a person receives the gospel and believes in the Lord, immediately he goes into the water to be baptized. To practice this way is according to the Lord&rsquo;s mind; it is to follow the Bible&rsquo;s example, and it is spiritually profitable. However, it also requires faith and spiritual power. We need to preach the gospel with power and have the faith to baptize. Otherwise, we are merely imitating the letter of the Scriptures without spiritual reality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. THE PLACE OF BAPTISM</h2>
<p>There is no restriction concerning the place of baptism; any place with water is good for baptism. After the eunuch from Ethiopia believed the gospel, Philip baptized him along the road when they came to some water (Acts 8:36-38).</p>
<p>John 3:23 also says, &ldquo;And John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and they came and were baptized.&rdquo; Because there was much water in Aenon, John baptized there. This shows that a place that is right for baptism must have sufficient water. As long as a place has enough water for a person to be immersed, that is a suitable place to have a baptism.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. THE CORRECTION OF BAPTISM</h2>
<p>Acts 19:3-5 says, &ldquo;And he said, Into what then were you baptized? And they said, Into John&rsquo;s baptism. And Paul said, John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people that they should believe in the One coming after him, that is, in Jesus. And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; These verses tell us that there were about twelve disciples in Ephesus who were baptized with John&rsquo;s baptism of repentance. They were not aware of the fact that John&rsquo;s ministry was to lead men to believe in the Lord Jesus and that the baptism of repentance which he preached had passed away with him after the ministry of the Lord Jesus had begun, so that men must now be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. Once they realized this matter, they immediately were corrected. In the early days this out-of-date baptism of repentance, which was inaccurate, needed to be corrected. Likewise, today there are also some improper practices of baptism, such as baptism by sprinkling, infant baptism, and baptism performed on those who have not yet properly believed in the Lord or who do not yet have a spiritual contact with Christ. These also need to be corrected. Of course, in making the correction, we also must exercise our faith to receive all the spiritual realities of baptism.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Baptism, as the conclusion of our repentance and faith, is closely related to our salvation. It is a condition for us to be regenerated and enter into the kingdom of God. Through baptism we are forgiven of our sins and receive the Holy Spirit, we are put into Christ, and we are saved. As long as we have believed in the Lord Jesus with all our heart, we are qualified to be baptized. Nothing less than faith is acceptable, and nothing more than faith is necessary. Furthermore, whoever has the authority to preach the gospel has the authority to baptize. Anyone who is a disciple may baptize. Concerning the time of baptism, once a person has believed in the Lord, he must be baptized immediately and not hesitate a minute. This example is clearly set forth in the Scriptures. All these points, of course, are given here as principles. In practice, we must have the leading of the Holy Spirit, and we also need faith and spiritual power. We must preach the gospel with power and baptize with faith. Concerning the place of baptism, there is no restriction except that there should be enough water for a person to be immersed. If a person&rsquo;s baptism was improper, it should be corrected.</p>
