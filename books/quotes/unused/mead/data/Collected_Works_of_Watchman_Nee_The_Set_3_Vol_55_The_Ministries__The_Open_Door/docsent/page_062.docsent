   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Only One Church in One Locality</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is one thing we must all notice: The world does not have a church; therefore, the Roman Catholic Church is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A country does not have a church; therefore, the Anglican Church i.e., the Church of England or the Episcopal Church is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A province does not have a church, nor does a race.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible only the smallest administrative unit is related to the church only a locality or a city has a church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church in one locality cannot combine with the church in another locality to become one church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each city can only be matched with one church, just as a husband can only be matched with one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, in Antioch, there is the church in Antioch, not the churches in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It would be wrong to say the churches in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to God's arrangement, a locality can only be matched with one church, not many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible we can never find the churches in Corinth or the churches in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the Bible does say the church in Antioch, the church in Philippi, and the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All of these churches are referred to in the singular.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There were not multiple churches in Antioch, Philippi, or Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's arrangement for the church on the spiritual side is the authority of the Holy Spirit, and in its outward appearance, it is the limitation of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the church in Corinth was about to divide itself into four parts, Paul immediately rebuked them for being divisive and fleshy 1 Cor 1:10-13; 3:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Corinthians were about to divide into a few smaller churches, one of Paul, another of Cephas, another of Apollos, and another of Christ, the Holy Spirit said that was fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Each city, each locality, can only be matched with one church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever more than one appears, it is a division, a sect, which God rejects.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From God's point of view, the church in Corinth became fleshy because there can only be one church in one locality; a second church can never be established.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If one church is already established, the second is a division and is fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There can never be more than one church in one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Someone may say that he desires to supply others with spiritual food, but supplying spiritual food is not sufficient ground to establish a church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Someone may say that he wants to help others to understand the Bible, but helping others understand the Bible is also not sufficient ground to establish a church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Neither is teaching others to know the Holy Spirit adequate grounds for establishing a church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Someone may say that we need a revival and that a revival church should be established.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Recently in a certain place, someone established a Revival Church for the sole purpose of revival, but revival is not sufficient grounds to establish a church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Men cannot establish a church, because men do not have the ground to establish a church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul did not have the ground to establish a church; neither did Cephas or Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesus had the ground to establish a church, but Paul was not equal to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Corinth had the ground to establish a church, but Paul was not equal to Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Neither was Cephas or Apollos; they were all not equal to Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They did not have the ground, and they were not qualified to establish a church, because a church must be matched with a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anything that comes short of a locality cannot establish a church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there is no locality, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is more than evident that God takes the boundary of locality as the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There Can Only Be One Church in Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Shanghai the church does not stand on denominationalism, sectarianism, or any other ground, but on the ground of Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose I have a quarrel with Brother Chang.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I let him meet on Nanyang Road, while I find a place on North Szechuan Road.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One goes south and the other goes north in the opposite direction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At North Szechuan Road I can preach the gospel, and a group of people can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>While the meeting hall on Nanyang Road can seat 2,400 people, I can build a bigger hall to seat 2,600.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even though I preach the gospel and start a meeting, bringing many to salvation, giving messages, and edifying the saints, I can never become the church because the qualification to take Shanghai as the ground of the church has already been taken.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am not qualified to set up another church because there can only be one church in Shanghai.</S>
