   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Teaching of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being the Real Leadership</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1986 we had an elders' training on the one accord see Elders' Training Book 7 One Accord for the Lord's Move, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During that time I talked about the leading of the apostles and the leadership in the Lord's ministry, but I do not feel that what I said was accurately understood by some.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of this misunderstanding, I gave the last two messages in the summer training of 1987 on this matter see chapters eighteen and nineteen of The God-Ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In those messages, I pointed out that the leadership in the New Testament ministry in actuality is not the leadership of one controlling person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, we have the leadership of one controlling revelation in the one ministry through those who bring in the revelation of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Testament leadership is in the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the four Gospels, the leadership was with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That was the leadership in a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus was the Leader who had the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus sent His disciples to certain places.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His disciples were to obey whatever He said.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Acts and the Epistles, Peter and Paul were supposed to be the leaders, but for the most part, they did not send anyone anywhere to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of the going-out workers were sent by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Acts 13 tells us that Barnabas and Saul were "sent out by the Holy Spirit" v. 4 from Antioch to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of course, Paul did charge some of the younger brothers who were closely related to him, such as Timothy and Titus, to go to certain places and to do certain things 1 Cor 4:17; Titus 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He charged both Timothy and Titus to come to him, and they received these orders 2 Tim 4:9; Titus 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But there is at least one case referred to in 1 Corinthians 16:12 that we must see: "Now concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him much that he would come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come whenever he has opportunity."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul was very burdened to help the Corinthians solve their problems, and their problems involved him and Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why Paul expected that Apollos would go to see the Corinthians personally.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul did not say that he charged Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He said, "I urged him."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To urge someone to do something is much different from charging them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul said, "I urged him much...and it was not at all his desire."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although Paul urged him, Apollos still had the liberty, the freedom, not to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And he did not do what Paul wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Apollos said that he would come whenever he had opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This may seem like a small verse, but it is very important to the truth concerning the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This verse is very strong to prove that Paul did not exercise any control over the work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul was not the leader in the New Testament move of God in the sense of commanding the co-workers to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peter and Paul were not strict in this matter of the movement of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If they urged a worker to do something, and he felt not to do it, there was no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But all the apostles were very strict in the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4, Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently from God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The apostles would not tolerate any teaching that was different from God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The aged Apostle John, in his second Epistle, told the saints not to receive anyone who brings a teaching other than the teaching of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said that these ones went beyond the teaching of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that they went beyond the teaching concerning Christ, which is the basic teaching of the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John was strict to the extent that he even charged the saints not to greet such ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the matter of the teaching of the apostles, the apostles were very strict.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This proves that the teaching of the apostles actually is the real leadership in the New Testament.</S>
