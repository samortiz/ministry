<h2 class="head1">SIGNS AND WISDOM</h2><p>Verse 22 says, &ldquo;Since Jews indeed ask for signs and Greeks seek wisdom.&rdquo; A sign is a miraculous token (Matt. 12:38-39) to substantiate what is preached. Religion needs signs, and the Jews kept requiring them. Wisdom pertains to philosophy and was constantly sought by the Greeks.</p><p>In verse 22 Paul refers to two kinds of people&mdash;to religious Jews and philosophical Greeks. The religious ones desire signs, miracles, and the philosophical ones pursue wisdom. But in preaching Christ crucified, Paul cared for neither wisdom nor signs.</p><p>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, the Jews mocked Him and said, &ldquo;You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!&rdquo; (Matt. 27:40). The chief priests, the scribes, and the elders said, &ldquo;He saved others; himself he cannot save! He is king of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe on him&rdquo; (v. 42). They challenged the Lord to prove that He was the Christ, the Son of God, by delivering Himself from the cross. However, the Lord remained silent; He did not do anything to save Himself. Instead of a miracle and wisdom, there were weakness and foolishness. According to man&rsquo;s wisdom, it would be utterly foolish to be crucified.</p><p>In saying, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Cephas,&rdquo; the Corinthians were exercising their wisdom. They were following their philosophy, not following Christ. But Paul preached to them Christ crucified, an offense to miracle-seeking Jews and wisdom-pursuing Greeks. But to those who are called, this Christ is God&rsquo;s wisdom and God&rsquo;s power.</p><h2 class="head1">PREACHING CHRIST CRUCIFIED</h2><p>It is significant that Paul did not tell the Corinthians, &ldquo;We preach Christ resurrected.&rdquo; The focus of the preaching in Acts is on the resurrection of Christ. According to the book of Acts, this preaching is a testimony that Jesus Christ, the One who was crucified, has been resurrected. But in this Epistle Paul does not emphasize Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Rather, he emphasizes the preaching of Christ crucified. No doubt, both the Jews and the Greeks would have preferred to hear of a resurrected Christ. For Jews, this would have been a great miracle. How miraculous for someone to rise out of the tomb and ascend into the heavens! The Greeks may have regarded a word about resurrection as very philosophical. In their quest for wisdom they may have been interested to learn how a dead person could become alive again. Nevertheless, Paul preached a crucified Christ, a Christ who did not do anything to save Himself. Paul followed this crucified Christ and preached Him to the Corinthians. Therefore, verse 23 declares, &ldquo;But we preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offense, and to the nations foolishness.&rdquo; It was offensive to Jews and foolishness to Greeks that Paul followed a crucified Christ.</p><p>In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom.&rdquo; Those who are called are the believers who were chosen by God in eternity (Eph. 1:4) and who believed in Christ in time (Acts 13:48). To these called ones, the crucified Christ preached by the apostles is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom. Wisdom is for planning, for purposing; power is for carrying out, for accomplishing, what is planned and purposed. In God&rsquo;s economy Christ is both. Praise the Lord that for us today the crucified Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God!</p><p>In verse 25 Paul concludes, &ldquo;Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.&rdquo; Even God&rsquo;s foolishness is wiser than our wisdom, and His weakness stronger than our strength.</p>
