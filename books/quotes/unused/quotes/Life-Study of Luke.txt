It may seem that the Gospel of Luke is not as profound as the Gospel of Matthew or as mysterious as the Gospel of John
Although the Gospel of Luke is not the most profound or mysterious of the four Gospels, it is the most sweet and pleasant of the Gospels
The word 'many' in verse 1 indicates that there were more than four who wrote an account of the Savior's earthly life
Verse 2 indicates that the writer of this Gospel was not among those disciples who were with the Savior in His earthly life
The Greek word rendered 'attendants' means official servants, who attend or serve an officer or who have authority to carry out his orders
It narrates a complete genealogy of the Man Jesus, from His parents back to Adam, the first generation of mankind
As such, its record is according to the sequence of morality, not according to the sequence of historical events
The subject of the Gospel of Luke is marvelous: the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality
Not many readers of this Gospel realize that the Man-Savior and His salvation are both in the highest standard of morality
We need to keep in mind that the subject of the Gospel of Luke is the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality
In contrast to the Man-Savior, we have only one essence, the human essence, for we were conceived of man and born of woman
In ancient times there was a debate regarding the mingling of the divine essence and the human essence in the Person of the Lord Jesus
Some who misunderstood this mingling said that it caused a third nature to be produced, something which is neither divine nor human
According to this definition, when two or more things are mingled together, their original natures are not lost but remain distinguishable
When tea is mingled with water to make a beverage, neither the essence of tea nor the essence of water is lost
These two essences mingle together to produce a beverage, but they do not produce a third nature, something which is neither tea nor water
He is a Person with two essences-the divine and the human-mingled together without a third nature being produced
As the Man-Savior, the Lord Jesus possesses both the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues
Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence, He possesses the divine nature with the divine attributes
According to John 1:1 and 14, in the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, and this Word, which is God, became flesh
The makeup of the Man-Savior's being, His constitution, is a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues
In the Man-Savior man and God, God and man, are mingled to form a composition full of the divine attributes and the human virtues
If we read the Gospel of Luke carefully, we shall see that the divine attributes strengthen and enrich the human virtues
We have indicated that in the Gospel of Luke there are a number of gospel messages, gospel parables and gospel cases
In the following message we shall consider in more detail the meaning of the highest standard of morality portrayed in the Gospel of Luke
In this message we shall go on to consider what it means to say that the Man-Savior's salvation is in the highest standard of morality
The Man-Savior's salvation, which is in the highest standard of morality, is a salvation in His human virtues with His divine attributes
In this simple story, which even children may appreciate, we see that the Man-Savior lived in the highest standard of morality
The good shepherd loves the lost sheep, the woman treasures the lost coin, and the loving father receives the prodigal son when he returns
The Man-Savior's salvation in the highest standard of morality is also shown in the gospel cases recorded in Luke
Today the very Christ who lives in us is still the One who possesses the human virtues strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes
Have you ever realized that the Christ who lives in you is a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues?
In this book we have a picture of a Man who is genuine, moral, and perfect, a Man who reveals God in His saving grace to fallen mankind
The contents of the Gospel of Luke impress us with the completeness and perfection of the Man-Savior's humanity
The more we read this Gospel, the more we are impressed that it is the record of a Man, a full, whole, complete, perfect, and real Man
If we spend time to consider these gospel messages, gospel parables, and gospel cases, we shall be helped in our preaching of the gospel
One strong indication of this is 4:25-27, where the Lord refers first to the widow of Sidon and then to Naaman the Syrian
Of being written according to the sequence of historical events, the Gospel of Luke is written according to the sequence of morality
As we read the Gospel of Luke, we shall find certain cases that are recorded in a sequence different from that in the Gospel of Mark
Matthew's sequence is the sequence of doctrine concerning the kingdom, and Luke's sequence is the sequence of morality
In Matthew we have the view of doctrine; in Mark, the view of historical events; and in Luke, the view of morality
My burden in this message is to point out that the Man-Savior and His salvation are in the highest standard of morality
In the law we have the basic principle of divine love, divine light, divine holiness, and divine righteousness
If man had taken God into him as life, then the divine attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness would also have come into man
From the beginning, in the first two chapters of Genesis, we see that man with the human virtues was created by God according to what He is
In particular, since God is light and love and is holy and righteous, He created man according to these attributes
We have pointed out that at the time of his creation man did not have the reality of love, light, holiness, and righteousness
In this lengthy section of the Gospel of Luke we have a full picture showing us how the Man-Savior was prepared for His ministry
They were both righteous in the sight of God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless'
righteous' means to be right, blameless in the sight of God according to the Old Testament commandments and ordinances
They still needed the unblemished sin and trespass offerings in type for their atonement that they might have contact with God
The forerunner of the Man-Savior, John the Baptist, was not conceived by his parents' natural strength, for they were overage
Concerning this, 1:7 says, 'And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in age'
Luke 1:10 says, 'And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of the burning of incense'
It implies that our natural strength must be brought to an end so that God's operation may begin by His divine act
The Greek word for John is Ioannes, meaning Jehovah is favorable, Jehovah shows grace, or Jehovah is the gracious Giver
The Man-Savior was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence in a human virgin with the human essence
The virgin Mary lived in a despised city of a region without fame, but she was a descendant of the royal family of King David
According to 1:28-30, the angel told Mary that she was a favored one, one endued with grace, and that she had found favor, grace, with God
In verse 31 the angel Gabriel went on to say, 'And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus'
Jesus' is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word Joshua , which means Jehovah the Savior, or, the salvation of Jehovah
As the cloud overshadowed the Mount of Transfiguration and the tabernacle , the power of the most High would overshadow Mary
Matthew 118 and 20 tell us that Mary was found having in womb out of the Holy Spirit and the thing begotten in her is out of the Holy Spirit
Through this, God joined Himself to humanity that He might be manifested in the flesh and might be a Man-Savior
Even though this word has been used wrongly, the Bible reveals the truth that Christ our Lord is the mingling of God with man
We need to be deeply impressed with this matter, for it is the basic element for our knowledge of the wonderful Person of the Lord Jesus
Because the conceiving was of the Holy Spirit, what was born of this conception was a holy thing, something intrinsically holy
The second part of 1:32 says concerning the Man-Savior, 'The Lord God will give to Him the throne of David His father'
Luke 1:33 goes on to say, 'And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom there shall not be an end'
In the brief word spoken to Mary by the angel there is a clear revelation that the One who was to be born of her is both God and man
In the previous message we began to consider the conception of John the Baptist, the Lord's forerunner, and the conception of the Man-Savior
In this message we shall consider the blessing of the mother of the Man-Savior's forerunner and the praise of the Man-Savior's mother
Verse 42 says, 'And she lifted up her voice with a loud cry and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb'!
Such a blessing indicates that Elizabeth was also a godly woman, fit for God's use in carrying out His purpose
The Greek word rendered 'fruit' in verse 42, karpos, is used for Christ in the sense of offspring only here and in Acts 2:30
Christ is the branch of Jehovah and of David , and the fruit of Mary and of David that we may eat of Him as the tree of life
The forerunner of the Man-Savior even exulted upon meeting the Savior, while both of them were still in their mothers' wombs
It also indicates that the Lord Jesus would grow up in a family which would be filled with the knowledge and love of God's holy Word
Although Mary was a young woman, she was very knowledgeable concerning the Old Testament and could quote verses from it in her praise to God
Her spirit was filled with joy in God her Savior so that her soul manifested her joy for the magnification of the Lord
She does not say anything concerning Christ as does Elizabeth in her blessing and Zachariah in his prophecy through the Holy Spirit
He should be magnified in our thoughts, in our likes and dislikes, and in our decisions concerning our direction
Both Mary and Zachariah stress Gods mercy realizing their low estate and humbly recognizing that they are not worthy of being favored by God
When we are in a pitiful condition, His mercy first reaches us and brings us into a situation where God is able to favor us with His grace
In verses 51 and 52 she says He has done mighty things with His arm He has scattered those who are proud in the understanding of their heart
Because their estate was so low, they needed God's mercy to reach them, for His mercy extends further than His grace
He has succored Israel His servant to remember mercy, even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever'
Gods mercy takes care of their condition and His faithfulness takes care of His position so that He can favor them with His gracious doings
She could speak concerning Gods mercy and His mighty doings in caring for His people according to the faithful promises given to the fathers
As we consider Mary's praise, we can see something of the reason she was chosen by God for the conception of the Man-Savior
She went on to praise God in His mercy and in His faithful doings in taking care of His people, who were in a low estate
In this section we have already covered the conception of John the Baptist, the Lord's forerunner , and the conception of the Man-Savior
The conception of the Man-Savior was of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence in the womb of a human virgin with the human essence
We have pointed out that the conception of John the Baptist and that of Jesus the Savior are different in essence
The result of this conception was simply a man, one who was filled with the Spirit of God but who lacked the nature of God
Concerning this miraculous birth, 1:57 and 58 say, 'Now the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth to give birth, and she brought forth a son
When they gestured to Zachariah as to what his child should be called, he wrote on a tablet, 'John is his name'
The Greek word rendered John is Ioannes,meaning Jehovah is favorable, Jehovah shows grace, or Jehovah is the gracious Giver
After Zachariah wrote John's name on the tablet, 'his mouth was opened instantly, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke blessing God'
By raising up Christ as a horn of salvation and as the rising sun, God's redemptive work results in the salvation of His people
As the fruit in Elizabeth's blessing , He is life to us ; as the sun in Zachariah's prophecy, He is the light to us
When we compare Zachariah's word in verse 69 with that in verse 78, we see that he speaks concerning Christ's dual Person
Regarding this Zachariah says To show mercy to our fathers and to remember His holy covenant the oath which He swore to Abraham our father
It was easy for their child to grow and become strong in his spirit, with the result that he lived in the wilderness
Luke 2:1-3 says, 'Now it came about in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for all the inhabited earth to be enrolled
Apart from the decree of Caesar Augustus, it might not have been possible for Joseph and Mary to go from Nazareth to Bethlehem
Such a move was necessary in order for Christ to be born in Bethlehem to fulfill the prophecy in the Old Testament
Luke describes His genuine human birth according to the law of Gods creation of man so that He might be a ManSavior for the salvation of man
Lukes record of the same birth and the same youth is of another category that of events which offer strong proof of Jesus genuine humanity
The birth of the Man-Savior was announced to the shepherds by an angel as the good news of great joy to all the people
Verse 8 says, 'And there were shepherds in the same country, living in the fields and keeping the nightwatches over their flock'
When the angel of the Lord stood by the shepherds and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, they feared greatly
In verse 12 the angel went on to say, 'And this is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger'
The exultation of the angels, who were excited by the birth of the Savior for man's salvation , resulted in praise to God
According to verse 14, the coming of the Savior rendered glory to God in the heavens and brought peace to men on earth
The praise of the heavenly army has two aspects: glory in the highest places to God and peace among men on earth
In 2:15-20 we are told that the shepherds went to Bethlehem and 'found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger'
The shepherds, after hearing the preaching of the angel and after coming to see the little child, began to preach to others
As a Child on the one hand He was presented offered to God on the other hand simultaneously He was adored praised and worshipped by man
Anna was a widow 'up to the age of eighty-four, who did not depart from the temple, serving with fastings and petitions night and day'
In 2:21-38 we see that the Man-Savior, in order to be a proper Israelite according to the law, was circumcised, named, and offered to God
Luke 239 says And when they had finished all things according to the law of the Lord they returned into Galilee to their own city Nazareth
Luke 2:40 says, 'And the little child grew and became strong, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him'
If we do not have grace, we shall not have the power, strength, or energy to carry out a certain matter in the proper way
If we have wisdom without grace, we shall be disappointed because we shall not be able to fulfill our responsibility
In 2:41-51 we see that the Lord Jesus cared for God's interest at the age of twelve and also subjected Himself to His parents
According to verses 43 through 48, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and His parents did not know it
In order for Him to be the King, there was the need of certain events to prove that He was the genuine heir and successor of David's throne
In order for Him to be revealed as a real Man, there was the need of evidences to prove the genuineness of His humanity
Through His conception, birth, and youth He was prepared as a complete Person to be our Savior in His humanity with His divinity
Verse 3 says that 'he came into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins'
Baptism is a matter of burying the repenting people, terminating them so that the Man-Savior may germinate them by regeneration
In 34 to prepare the way of the Lord and to make His paths straight means to change peoples minds turning their minds toward the ManSavior
Both the condition of men's hearts and their relationships need to be dealt with for the way to be prepared for the Savior's coming
In verse 8 John the Baptist told the people that God was able to raise up children to Abraham out of the stones
In 3:10-14 we have a record of John's word to the crowds, to the tax collectors, and to some who were serving in the military
Verse 15 says Now while the people were in expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John whether he might be the Christ
We see that although John preached a baptism of repentance, the goal of his ministry was a wonderful Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God
He realized that he was only a messenger sent by Jehovah of hosts to bring people to Jesus Christ and exalt Him as the goal of his ministry
In verse 16 John said that he baptized with water, but the One coming, the Man-Savior, will baptize people in the Holy Spirit and fire
The first was a sign of John's ministry of repentance; the latter, a sign of the Man-Savior's ministry of life
The Holy Spirit, into whom the Man-Savior baptizes those who believe in Him, is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God
According to the context, 'fire' in 3:16 and 17 is not the fire in Acts 2:3, which is related to the Holy Spirit
In these verses there are three kinds of baptism: the baptism in water, the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and the baptism in fire
The baptism in water is for repentance, the baptism in the Holy Spirit is for life, and the baptism in fire is for perdition
Luke 3:17 indicates that the Lord will gather the wheat into His barn, but will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
By being baptized He lived and ministered in resurrection even before His actual death and resurrection three and a half years later
By the Spirit of God descending upon Him as a dove the Lord Jesus ministered in gentleness and singleness focusing solely on the will of God
Whereas the descending of the Spirit is the anointing of Christ, the speaking of the Father is a testimony to Him as the beloved Son
The fact that John the Baptist baptized the Man-Savior with water indicates that it was necessary even for Him to be baptized
He allowed Himself to be put into death so that He might minister not in a natural way, but in the way of resurrection
According to chapter two of Genesis, this God-created man with his human virtues was placed in front of the tree of life
When the tree of life is added to the God-created man, the result is a living in the highest standard of morality
Although the Lord Jesus was a complete and perfect Man, He needed to be put aside in order to live a life that expressed God
To be baptized simply means to be put aside, to be terminated and buried so that we may live not by ourselves but by God
If we are set aside in this way, we shall be able to live a human life with the divine attributes expressed in the human virtues
The Lord Jesus was a perfect Man, a Man with all the human virtues, yet He was nevertheless in the likeness of the flesh of sin
When the Lord Jesus came out to minister at the age of thirty, He was the representative of mankind in two aspects
On the one hand, He represented the God-created man; on the other hand, in appearance He represented fallen man
We would emphasize the fact that the Lord Jesus did not have the actual nature of fallen man, but He did have the appearance of fallen man
In actual nature He represented the God-created man, and in appearance, likeness, but not in nature, He also represented fallen man
In His actual human nature He represented the man created by God; in appearance He represented the man who had become fallen
In order that He might express God in His human living, at the beginning of His ministry the Lord put Himself aside through baptism
If we would enter into a particular service to God, we need to be set aside; that is, we need to be terminated and buried
After John the Baptist had baptized the Lord Jesus, God the Father sent His Holy Spirit upon this baptized Man
The Spirit of God descended upon a terminated and buried Man to inaugurate Him into His living ministry for God
The Holy Spirit's conceiving of Jesus in 1:35 is essential, related to the divine Being, the divine Person, of Jesus
The essence of the Holy Spirit's divine element in the conception of Jesus is unchangeable and cannot be removed
It was in this economical way that God forsook Jesus and left Him when He was carrying the sinners' sin in dying for them on the cross
He was constituted of the Holy Spirit as the intrinsic essence of His being when He was conceived in the womb of the virgin Mary
It is very important that we see these two aspects of the Holy Spirit-the essential aspect and the economical aspect
We have the confidence to say that the indwelling Spirit is essential; it is a matter of essence for being, for existence
In Luke 3:21 and 22 we see that the Lord Jesus as the Man-Savior was inaugurated into His office and ministry by two steps
After the Lord Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, God the Father sent the Holy Spirit upon the Lord economically for His ministry
The New Testament at its beginning presents four biographies to portray the four main aspects of this all-inclusive Christ
The kingdom of which Christ is the King is composed of Abrahams descendants including both his descendants in the flesh and those in faith
Based upon this, it may be said that he was the son of God, even as the heathen poets considered all mankind to be the offspring of God
We were created by God, we became fallen in Adam, we received God's promise in Abraham, and we were saved in Jesus who is Christ
Because the Lord's genealogy begins with man and ends with God, passing through Abraham and Adam, it is truly unique
We were created by God, we became fallen in Adam, we received the promise in Abraham, and we have been saved in Jesus, who is Christ
After being baptized in water and anointed with the Spirit of God, Jesus as a Man moved according to the leading of the Spirit
The Lord, however, was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness in order that He might be tempted by the Devil
We should not be proud, thinking that because we have the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit we are now able to withstand temptation
Through the testing of the Man-Savior, God was able to show His enemy, Satan, the Devil, that there is a Man who can withstand temptation
The Holy Spirit will never lead us to be tempted by the Devil, because we are not able to withstand Satan's temptation
The only One in this universe with the humanity that can withstand the temptation of God's enemy is the Lord Jesus, our Man-Savior
According to Luke 4:3, the Devil said to the Lord Jesus, 'If You are the Son of God, speak to this stone that it may become bread'
Although He stood on the ground of a man, He was also the Son of God, as God the Father had declared at His baptism
If the Lord assumed His position as the Son of God before the enemy, He would have lost the standing to defeat him
Luke 4:5-7 says, 'And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in a moment of time
In Luke 48 we have the Lords answer to the Devils temptation It is written You shall worship the Lord your God and Him alone you shall serve
The Man-Savior, the One who lived in the highest standard of morality, could not be seduced or moved by anything
Concerning this, 4:13 says, 'And when the Devil had concluded every temptation, he went away from Him until an opportune time'
In 1:30-35 we have the prophecy of the archangel Gabriel, who came to Mary and told her that God intended that she conceive the Man-Savior
Gabriel said that the Man-Savior would be called Jesus , which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah
Gabriel indicated that the coming Man-Savior would be called Son of the Most High , a title that refers to His deity
The archangel Gabriel refers to the coming Savior as 'the holy thing' which is to be born and who will be called Son of God
According to Gabriel's word, the Man-Savior is Jesus, the Son of the Most High, a descendant of David, and the holy thing
In 211 we have the angels announcement at the birth of the ManSavior A Savior was born to you today in Davids city who is Christ the Lord
The second angel was the one who made the announcement to the shepherds concerning the birth of the Man-Savior
The five people involved in the preparation of the Man-Savior were Zachariah, Mary, Elizabeth, Simeon, and Anna
Love, light, holiness, and righteousness are God's attributes, and God created man according to these attributes
Because God wanted the man created by Him to become a God-man, after creating man God placed him in front of the tree of life
God's intention was that the man created by Him would receive Him, as signified by the tree of life, and thereby become a God-man
In Genesis 2 there is the indication that God wanted the man created by Him to receive Him by partaking of the fruit of the tree of life
Because man had not become a God-man, because he did not actually have God within him, he was not able to withstand the enemy's temptation
In Genesis 1 and 2 we have a God-created man, a man who was not able to withstand the temptation of God's enemy
When the Lord Jesus set Himself aside at the time of His baptism, the economical Spirit descended upon Him to anoint Him
Of waiting for the enemy to come to Him, the Lord Jesus, being led of the Spirit, went to the place where the enemy was
When the human virtues created by God are strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes, that is the highest standard of morality
If we understand this matter, we shall understand the basic and crucial principle followed by Luke in writing his Gospel
In 4:1-13 we see that the fully equipped Man-Savior was led by the Spirit to the wilderness where He faced the tempter and defeated him
After gaining the victory over the Devil's temptation, He was fully prepared and equipped to carry out the ministry God had given Him
The first section is the introduction , and the second concerns the preparation of the Man-Savior in His humanity with His divinity
The third section, which is quite lengthy, covers the ministry of the Man-Savior in His human virtues with His divine attributes
As we read the account of this incident, we see that Jesus, the Man-Savior, conducted Himself in His human virtues
In this situation the Man-Savior was very kind and patient, realizing that this woman had been convicted of her sins
In addition to exercising kindness, patience, and mercy toward the woman, the Lord Jesus also exercised His understanding
In 7:36-50 we see the Man-Savior in the house of a Pharisee acting in His human virtues with His divine attributes
It is easy to see the human virtues of the Samaritan, but where in this parable do we see the divine attributes?
In the Lord's word to the thief we see not merely the human virtues, but also the divine attributes manifested in the Lord's human virtues
These illustrations should help us understand how the Lord ministered in His human virtues with His divine attributes
His teaching released the word of light to enlighten those in the darkness of death so that they might receive the light of life
We see that the Spirit of the Lord was upon the Man-Savior because God had anointed Him to bring good news to the poor
The words of grace refer to the words in verse 21, including the words in verses 18 and 19, which are words of the gospel
Verse 22 indicates that those in the synagogue knew the Savior according to the flesh , not according to the Spirit
Although the people marveled at the words of grace that proceeded out of the Lord's mouth, it is not likely that they understood these words
Although they marveled at the words of grace proceeding out of the Lord's mouth, they were nevertheless filled with anger
In the foregoing message we pointed out that the Lord Jesus began His ministry by proclaiming the jubilee of grace
It is not likely that before Luke 4 the Jews understood Isaiah's word concerning the acceptable year of the Lord
One day the Lord Jesus entered into the synagogue and read from Isaiah 61 regarding the acceptable year of the Lord
In Psalm 90:10 Moses said that the days of our years are threescore years and ten, and by reason of strength they may be fourscore years
The one who has lost everything, including his land and himself, would surely look forward to the year of jubilee
When the year of jubilee came, he would rejoice at being released and recovering the right to his portion of the land
Every fallen human being has lost the right to enjoy God as the tree of life and the right to enjoy Christ as the good land
The year of jubilee indicates that we can be released from bondage and recover the right to enjoy Christ as our portion
According to chapter four of the Gospel of Luke, the Lord Jesus proclaimed the jubilee on a particular Sabbath day in Galilee
We have been recovered to the enjoyment of the Triune God as the tree of life and of Christ as our land, our portion
The good land is actually more mysterious than the tree of life, for the good land is the fulfillment of the tree of life
Adam did not eat of the fruit of the tree of life, but the children of Israel partook of the riches of the good land
Today we are enjoying the Triune God as the tree of life, and, even the more, we are enjoying Christ as the good land
Once we were captives, but we have been released from slavery and brought back to the freedom of the glory of the children of God
Since the New Testament age is the real year of jubilee, this means that God will restore us to our original condition
We have emphasized the fact that the Gospel of Luke presents the Man-Savior in the highest standard of morality
In Luke 4:31-44 the Man-Savior carries out His fourfold commission: teaching, casting out demons, healing, and preaching
As the One authorized by God, the Lord Jesus taught realities whereas the scribes taught vain knowledge without authority or power
The Man-Savior had not only spiritual power to subdue people, but divine authority to subject them to the divine ruling
The fallen angels work with Satan in the air , and these demons, the unclean spirits, move with him on the earth
After the Lord cast out the demon, 'amazement came upon all, and they spoke to one another, saying, What is this word?
In 4:38 and 39 we have the record of the Lord's healing of Simon's mother-in-law, who had been seized with a high fever
In addition to teaching, casting out demons, and healing the sick, the Lord was also 'preaching in the synagogues of Judea'
In the remainder of this message we shall consider 5:1-11, a case of the Man-Savior's attracting the occupied ones
Luke 51 says Now it came about as the crowd pressed upon Him and listened to the word of God that He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret
Human beings were created by God for Himself, but they are occupied and kept from Him by the matter of making a living
The first disciples were called and attracted by the Lord not from their sinful life, but from their occupation
Those who are occupied with making a living usually give excuses when invited to hear the gospel or to attend a meeting
As we read Matthew and Mark, we may wonder why Peter and the others followed the Lord when He told them to come and follow Him
In Luke 5 we have an additional record indicating that when the Lord Jesus called Peter, He performed a miracle related to fishing
A few years later, after the Lord's resurrection, it seemed that Peter had nothing to do, and he announced that he was going fishing
Verse 2 says, 'He saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing the nets'
He taught the crowds from the boat and when He had ceased speaking He said to Simon Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch
The Greek word, a different one from that translated Master in 2:29, denotes one who exercises any kind of oversight
Peter was a professional fisherman, the lake had an abundance of fish, and night was the proper time for fishing
The reason the Lord exercised His sovereignty in this way was that His intention was to attract Simon and his brother
We are told that 'amazement had taken possession of him and all who were with him at the catch of the fish which they took'
Luke's intention in 5:1-11 is to show how the Man-Savior acted in His ministry in His human virtues with His divine attributes
Immediately following, we have the case of the cleansing of a man full of leprosy, the cleansing of a contaminated one
In addition to being occupied and contaminated, we are paralyzed, despised, and under the bondage of the deformed regulations
No matter what a person's occupation may be, when he is called by the Lord and released, he immediately realizes that he is sinful
After they are healed, they come to see that they are 'tax collectors,' despised persons considered to be of no value
Eventually, they understand that they are under the bondage of certain regulations and are in need of both satisfaction and liberation
In each of these cases we can see the human virtues of the Man-Savior and also the divine attributes expressed in His human virtues
As man He was filled with the human virtues, and as God He had the divine attributes that enabled Him to cleanse the man's leprosy
In the case of the healing of the paralytic , we also see the Lord's divine attributes expressed in His human virtues
The Lord Jesus exercised His divine authority to forgive the paralytic's sins and His divine power to heal him
Matthew was one of the tax collectors , probably in a high position, a man who was condemned, despised, and abhorred by the Jews
There must have been some attracting power with the Lord, either in His word or appearance, that caused Matthew to follow Him
We have pointed out that the Jewish people despised the tax collectors because they were collecting taxes for the Roman imperialists
The great reception held for the Lord Jesus in Matthew's house might have been financed with unrighteous money
It was an excellent opportunity for him to invite a large crowd of tax collectors and sinners to eat with the Lord Jesus
In 530 the Pharisees and the scribes murmured at the Lords disciples saying Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners
The judgment of a judge is according to righteousness, whereas the healing of a physician is according to mercy and grace
The Lord's word here implies that the self-righteous Pharisees did not realize their need of Him as a physician
According to their meager knowledge of the Scriptures, they cared for the ritual of keeping the Sabbath, not for the hunger of the people
He, the Son of Man, was the very God who ordained the Sabbath, and He had the right to change what He had ordained concerning the Sabbath
In these two instances the Lord broke the deformed sabbatical regulations for the sake of people's satisfaction and liberation
We have been attracted away from our occupations and we have been cleansed, healed, uplifted, satisfied, and freed
Luke 6:12 says, 'And it came about in these days that He went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God'
The Lord Jesus prayed in order to have fellowship with God and seek God's will and pleasure concerning His ministry
The Man-Savior did not carry out His ministry by Himself in a way that was independent of God or according to His own will
Rather, He fulfilled His ministry according to God's will and pleasure by being one with God to fulfill His purpose
The main point in the choosing of the twelve as described in 6:13-16 is that the Lord Jesus set Himself aside and did not act by Himself
Much of the Lord's teaching in 6:17-49 is similar to that in chapters five through seven of the Gospel of Matthew
Whatever is decreed in Matthew 5-7, as the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, constitutes the reality of the kingdom of the heavens
At the time of speaking, this portion, except verses 24 through 26 and 39, applied to the believing remnant of the Jews
We have seen that in chapters five through seven of Matthew we have the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens
The first principle in these verses is that we who believe in Christ and who have been born of God should be a people blessed by God
It is often difficult for those who are rich in earthly, material things to be poor in heavenly, spiritual things
If someone chosen and called by God becomes rich in material things it may be very difficult for that one to become poor in spiritual things
Our human spirit, the deepest part of our being, is the organ for us to contact God and to realize spiritual things
We need to be poor, emptied, unloaded, in this part of our being so that we may realize and possess the kingdom of God
The second characteristic of a blessed people is to hunger now: 'Blessed are those who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied'
We realize that we are poor in spiritual things, and then we hunger after the things we lack in the spiritual realm
Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner their fathers did to the prophets'
The reason for this is that the entire world is following Satan, and we are following the Lord to go in the opposite way
Verses 24 through 26, at the time of speaking, could apply to the unbelieving Jews, who hardened their hearts to reject the Savior
It is also the highest standard of morality to bless those who curse us and to pray concerning those who revile us
In verse 30 the Lord goes on to say To everyone who asks of you give and from him who takes away your things do not require their return
As Spirit is the nature of God's Person, and light is the nature of God's expression, so love is the nature of God's being
In this message we shall continue to consider 6:17-49, where the Lord Jesus teaches His disciples the highest morality
The Lord is saying that when we give to others, our Father in heaven will always return to us much more than we give
In 6:40 the Lord continues, 'A disciple is not above his teacher; but everyone who has been perfected will be as his teacher'
In 6:41 and 42 the Lord says, 'And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but the log in your own eye you do not consider?
Hypocrite, first take the log out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck in your brother's eye'
In 6:43 and 44 the Lord says, 'For there is no good tree producing rotten fruit, nor again a rotten tree producing good fruit
For each tree is known by its own fruit; for they do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a thornbush'
If our being and our work are based upon the Lord's word, they will be able to withstand any kind of test, any 'flood' or 'river'
Our being and work must be founded on the word of the Man-Savior for the accomplishment of the will of our Father
The crucial point here is that if we would have a certain being and behave in a certain way, we must have a certain kind of life
When Christ, the God-man, was on earth, He lived a life that was according to the highest standard of morality
The teaching in 61749 was given by the Godman after He had prayed throughout the night and after He had appointed twelve to be His apostles
The fact that He prayed all night indicates that He did not initiate this teaching and that He was not its source
No doubt, after spending the entire night in prayer, the Lord Jesus was absolutely out of Himself and in God the Father
It was in the Father, not in Himself, that He appointed the twelve and taught the disciples the highest standard of morality
The living that is according to the highest standard of morality issues from the divine life with which we have been born of the Most High
For each tree is known by its own fruit; for they do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a thornbush'
Confucius was not able to present the kind of teaching we have in 6:17-49, because he did not have the divine life or know the divine life
In a very real sense, He Himself was the divine life, and He imparted Himself to the disciples as the divine life
When these elders reached Jesus, 'they entreated Him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that You should grant this to him
The Gentile centurion recognized the authority of the Man-Savior and realized that His word was a word with healing authority
The centurion had only one hundred soldiers under his authority, but the Lord Jesus has the whole universe under His authority
He volunteered, in His tender mercy, His power of resurrection to raise the widow's son from death, without being asked to do so
In His raising up the dead son and giving him to his mother we see the expression of the ManSaviors divine attributes in His human virtues
When we put these two cases together, we see that the Man-Savior, the God-man, was full of human virtues with the divine attributes
Coming up to Him, the men said, John the Baptist sent us to You, saying, Are You the One who is coming, or should we expect another'?
After that, he was put into prison and there he waited, expecting that Christ would do something to deliver him
When John the Baptist was conceived, it was said that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah
John and the Lord Jesus also 'sang a dirge' to preach repentance, but these ones 'did not weep' for the grief of sin
In verse 33 the Lord continues, 'For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon'!
John the Baptist, who came to bring men to repentance and cause them to grieve for sin, had no taste for eating or drinking
Christ is not only the Savior, but also the Friend of sinners, the One who sympathized with their problems and sensed their griefs
They said that John had a demon and that the Lord Jesus was a glutton, a wine drinker, and a friend of tax collectors and sinners
Those who believe in Christ are the children of wisdom, those who justify Christ and His deeds and follow Him as their wisdom
Those who have been forgiven and who now love the Lord, follow Him, and minister to Him should grow in life and shine as lamps
We may say that by accepting the Pharisee's request that He eat in his house, the Lord afforded the woman an opportunity to contact Him
Otherwise, this woman who was sinful and who was known for her sinfulness may not have had a way to contact the Savior
By accepting the Pharisees request to come to his house to eat the Lord gave an opportunity to this saved sinner to express her love for Him
A considerable crowd in Nain, having witnessed the Man-Savior's power of resurrection, recognized Him as a great prophet
Simon considered the woman a sinner, but did not consider himself a sinner, and he doubted that the Savior knew that she was a sinner
According to verse 42, when the two debtors had nothing to repay the moneylender, he graciously forgave them both
In verse 42 the Lord Jesus asked Simon which of the debtors would love the moneylender more as a result of having been forgiven by him
Verse 49 says, 'And those who were reclining at the table with Him began to say among themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins'?
In verse 50 we have the conclusion of this incident: 'But He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace'
The forgiven woman had not only love toward the Lord but faith in Him, a faith that operated through love and issued in peace
As we have pointed out, this should be regarded as the underlying principle in the writing of the Gospel of Luke
Regarding the two debtors who were forgiven by the moneylender, the Lord asked, 'Which of them therefore will love him more'?
According to verse 49, those who were reclining at the table with the Lord said among themselves, 'Who is this who even forgives sins'?
Luke's purpose is to show us that as those who are living in peace, following the Lord, and ministering to Him, we should grow in life
In 8:5-8 the Lord Jesus tells the parable of the sower; in verses 9 through 15 He explains this parable to His disciples
A heart that is like the wayside, like the soil beside the road, is a heart in which there is too much traffic of worldly business
The result will be that our heart will not be the proper soil for the growing of Christ, for it will be a heart hardened by worldly traffic
A person with such a heart may receive Christ and be saved; however, it will be difficult for him to grow in life
Such a heart gives all the ground to receiving the word so that the word may grow, bear fruit, and produce even a hundredfold
After we have been forgiven and have begun to live a life in peace, we should follow the Lord and minister to Him
The desire for a certain kind of new car may become a 'rock' in our hearts, a rock that makes it difficult for Christ to grow within us
In order for Him to grow within us, our hearts need to be free from anxiety, the deceitfulness of riches, and the pleasures of life
If we do not take the way of the world with its traffic, pleasures, and anxiety, our hearts will be released and available for Christ
For nothing is hidden that shall not become manifest, nor concealed that shall not by all means be known and become manifest'
The lamp which shines light indicates that the Man-Savior's ministry not only sows life into His people, but also brings light to them
Luke 8:19 says, 'And His mother and His brothers came up to Him, and they were not able to get to Him because of the crowd'
If we care for the word, we shall become the real relatives of the Man-Savior, and He will recognize us as such
By the authority of the kingdom, the storm is calmed, the demons are defeated, the sick are healed, and the dead are raised
In Luke these things are put together in order to show the journey we must make as those who believe in the Lord Jesus and follow Him
We see that while the Lord was asleep, a whirlwind came down upon the lake, and the boat was being filled with water
They were afraid and marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him'?
Since the disciples had both the Lord's word and His presence, they should have been at peace, not caring about the storm
When He tells us to go over to the other side, we may be sure that we shall reach the other side, no matter what kind of storms may come
Luke's account in 8:22-25 does not show a dispensational change; neither does it present the authority of the kingdom of God
According to the portrait in Luke, while we are taking the way ordained by the Lord, the Lord will be at rest, and the enemy will be busy
We need to remember that actually this is not our journey; it is the Lord's journey, and we are journeying with Him
Although the 'boat' of the church may be in the midst of a whirlwind and raging waters, we should not be troubled
Eventually the Lord and His disciples reached their destination, 'the country of the Gerasenes, which is across from Galilee'
The Lord cast out all these demons, giving them permission to enter into the many hogs that were feeding nearby
And the demons, coming out from the man, entered into the hogs; and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and were drowned'
We shall see that in such a place the Lord casts out a legion of demons and clears up the unclean business of hog raising
In the Life-study of Mark we pointed out that the business of raising hogs signifies the unclean industry of today's world
As a result, just as the Gerasenes begged the Lord to depart from them, the worldly people will ask us to go away from them
In 8:40-56 we have an account of the Lord's healing a woman with a flow of blood and His raising up a dead girl
In 8:41-42 Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, asked the Lord Jesus to heal his daughter, who was 'about twelve years old, and she was dying'
When his death sickness of sin is dealt with by the Savior's redeeming death , he rises up out of death into life
In order to understand the record of the Gospel of Luke, we need to see the significance of all the cases included in this Gospel
In our journey we may follow the Lord to a certain place, and there we shall meet legions of demons and unclean industry
In 7:36-50 we are represented by the sinful woman who had her sins forgiven and then began to love the Lord and live a life of peace
According to chapter eight, we follow Him, minister to His need, grow in life, shine as lamps, and become real relatives of the Lord
Because we are journeying at the Lord's word and with the Lord Himself in our boat, we should not be frightened by the storms
From experience we know that we are more likely to call on the Lord in a storm than when we are safe and at peace
As followers of the Lord Jesus taking the way He has ordained for our journey, we shall always become a blessing to society
We have seen that Matthew, Mark, and Luke all record the same three instances we have been considering in this message
In Luke these events are recorded in order to show us the journey that has been ordained for us by the Man-Savior
Because we take this journey at the Lord's word, we shall reach our destination no matter how many storms there may be
As His relatives, we are ready to journey on the way He has ordained and to travel and visit different places with Him
We may say that in chapters six through eight the twelve apostles were apprentices following the Lord to learn how to carry out His ministry
As indicated by the record in 7:36-8:56, their sins were forgiven and they began to love the Lord and live a life of peace
Chapter nine begins another section of the Gospel of Luke, a section concerned with the spreading of the jubilee
As we have seen, this gospel is the proclamation of the release of the captives and of the recovery of the lost birthright
Beginning with 9:1 we see the spreading of the ministry, the spreading of the jubilee, through the twelve apostles
The jubilee had already been proclaimed by the Man-Savior, and this proclamation continued until the end of chapter eight
Luke 9:1 says, 'And having called together the twelve, He gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to heal diseases'
Demons are the spirits of the living creatures who lived in the preadamic age and were judged by God when they joined Satan's rebellion
In particular, it is to proclaim the positive aspect of the jubilee-the recovery of our lost right to the enjoyment of God
Luke 9:6 says, 'And going out, they passed through from village to village, bringing the good news and healing everywhere'
The jubilee was declared in chapter four by the Man-Savior, but in chapter nine it was applied to those in Judea by the twelve
In 9:10 and 11 Luke goes on to say, 'And when the apostles returned, they related to Him whatever they had done
Luke 9:12-17 indicates that in the jubilee no one will be in want; no one will lack, and there will not be any poverty
The Lord seems to be saying, 'To those who are poor and have nothing to eat, you should give food without cost, without charge'
There should always be something left over, just as there were twelve baskets full of broken pieces left over in 9:17
They ate and were all satisfied; and they took up that which was left over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets'
We need to see the crucial point that Luke recorded this miracle in his Gospel from the point of view of the jubilee
After making that proclamation, He called certain ones to be His disciples, and of these He chose twelve to be His apostles
In this portion of the Gospel of Luke we have the spreading of the Man-Savior's ministry through the twelve apostles
When many readers of this Gospel come to chapter nine, they may forget about the jubilee that was announced in chapter four
We should not make this mistake, but should keep the jubilee in mind as we read through chapters five through twenty-four
If we have this view as we read 9:10-17, we shall want to see how the Man-Savior handles the situation with the hungry multitude
Luke 9:17 says, 'And they ate and were all satisfied; and they took up that which was left over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets'
In the jubilee there are no captives; on the contrary, all captives are released and brought back to the enjoyment of God
The disciples answered, 'John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and others that one of the ancient prophets has risen'
Luke 9:1 and 2 say, 'And having called together the twelve, He gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to heal diseases
We see that when the Man-Savior sent out the twelve to spread His ministry, He gave them power and authority over demons and disease
In God's kingdom we have the jubilee, and in the jubilee there is satisfaction but no hunger, fullness but no lack
The record concerning the recognizing of Christ in Matthew 16 involves the establishment of the kingdom and the building up of the church
Luke's intention is to show us that for the jubilee there is the need of the Christ, the Messiah, the anointed One
Immediately after the Lord was recognized as the Christ, He spoke to His disciples concerning His death and resurrection
Why, immediately after they recognized Him as the Christ, did He tell them that He was about to be crucified and resurrected?
The answer to these questions is that there cannot be a jubilee without Christ and without His death and resurrection
Our release from bondage is absolutely due to the all-inclusive death of Christ, a death that has released us from sin and Satan
When we believe in the all-inclusive, victorious death of Christ, we are released from sin, Satan, and ourselves
On the other hand, there is the need for us to identify ourselves with His death so that we may enjoy the jubilee
To identify ourselves with Christ's death is to bear the cross, and to bear the cross is to deny our soul life
In order to participate in the jubilee accomplished by Christ's death, it was necessary for them to bear the cross and deny the soul life
In 9:23 the Lord says, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me'
Because in resurrection He has become the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit , we follow Him in our spirit
In Luke 9:25 the Lord continues, 'For what is a man profited, having gained the whole world, but having lost or forfeited himself'?
The actual experience and enjoyment of the jubilee by the believers is found not in the Gospels but in the Acts and the Epistles
Through Christ with His death and resurrection Paul was released from his captivity into the enjoyment of the jubilee
According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, we need transfiguration in order to enjoy the jubilee
The Greek word rendered transfigured in Matthew 172 is the same as that translated transformed in Mark 92 2 Corinthians 318 and Romans 122
The ManSavior in the flesh needed transfiguration because He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin the likeness of the flesh of fallen man
A matured believer is one who has been fully transformed in his soul, that is, transformed in his mind, will, and emotion
Paul's word in Romans 8 indicates that although we are in the jubilee today, we are not yet in the jubilee in a full way
Many believers know only that their sins have been forgiven, but they do not know that their spirit has been regenerated
When we called on the name of the Lord for salvation and experienced the forgiveness of sins, our spirit was regenerated
We in the Lord's recovery have been brought back from theology and from mere doctrinal, mental understanding to our regenerated spirit
As we experience 2 Corinthians 3:18 and Romans 12:2, that is, as we are being transformed in our soul, we enjoy the jubilee
Soon after we were regenerated, many of us were misled by blind teachers, and we lost the enjoyment of the jubilee
Now in the Lord's recovery we have come back to our regenerated spirit, and we have begun to experience transformation in our soul
In 9:23 and 24 the Lord says, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul life will lose it, but whoever loses his soul life for My sake, this one shall save it'
The Lord's death crosses off the natural life and the old creation so that we may enter into the new creation, into a transfigured condition
When Peter, John, and James were in the atmosphere of the Lord's transfiguration, they were in the kingdom of God
Not many Christians have seen that the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus was the appearing of the kingdom of God and was also the jubilee
Although they were in the jubilee, they did not actually know anything about it, because they had not yet been transfigured
We need to be impressed that the transfiguration of the Man-Savior is related to the jubilee and is also the appearing of the kingdom of God
While the transfiguration was taking place on the mountaintop, down in the valley the disciples were trying to cast out a demon
Only three of the disciples-Peter, John, and James-were on the mountain with the Lord to participate in the jubilee
Because the disciples were still in the old creation, still in the natural life, they could not participate in the jubilee
The Lord seemed to be saying, 'I must die in order to accomplish the jubilee, and you need to die in order to participate in the jubilee
Without My death there will not be a jubilee, and without your death with Me you cannot participate in the jubilee'
Although the Lord had told the disciples to 'put these words' into their ears, they did not have the ability to hear what He was saying
For the jubilee and the experience of the jubilee, it was necessary for the Lord to die and for us to die with Him
He died for the accomplishment of the jubilee, and we died with Him in order to participate in the enjoyment of the jubilee
In reading the Gospel of Luke, we need to have the view that the jubilee declared in chapter four is the key to interpreting the entire book
The jubilee had not yet been accomplished, for it could only be accomplished by the death of Christ and in His resurrection
Realizing the situation, the Lord knew that it was difficult for Him and those with Him to pass through Samaria
Since the Lord sent out these seventy, it may have been that even more were following Him on the way through Samaria to Jerusalem
Because the Lord was rejected by the Samaritans, there was no way for Him and His followers to stay in that village
The following doubtful reading appears in a few manuscripts: 'and said, You do not know what kind of spirit you are of'
A few manuscripts add this doubtful reading at the end of verse 56 For the Son of Man did not come to destroy mens lives but to save them
He saw crowds being attracted to the Savior and wanted to follow Him out of curiosity, without counting the cost
In 9:57 and 58 we see that those who want to follow the Lord Jesus out of curiosity do not know the cost of following Him
The Savior encouraged him to pay the price that he might become a follower in His great commission to publish the kingdom of God
The answer of the one who asked to first go and bury his father indicates that he overly considered the cost of following the Man-Savior
To publish the kingdom of God is a living deed, a deed that makes the dead alive to enter into the kingdom of God
In verse 62 the Lord said to this one, 'No one putting his hand on a plow and looking at the things behind is fit for the kingdom of God'
To follow the Savior requires us to forget everything else and to press straight forward for the kingdom of God
We may say that the entire world today is like the region of Samaria in that the world utterly rejects the Man-Savior
In the last case, seen in 9:61 and 62, we realize that we cannot look backward or be held back by anything if we are to follow the Lord
The Savior appointed seventy disciples to share His ministry, even as Moses appointed seventy elders to share his burden as God charged him
The word 'harvest' indicates that the kingdom of God is established with things of life that can grow and multiply
The Lord considered the time of this sending to be the time of jubilee, and in the jubilee no one will be short of anything
In 10:5 and 6 we have an important word concerning peace: 'And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house
Luke 10:17 says, 'And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name'
Christ had to die in order to accomplish the jubilee, and we need to die in order to participate in the jubilee
In 10:20 the Lord told the disciples not to rejoice over the subduing of the demons, over the fact that the spirits are subject to them
Now no one knows who the Son is except the Father and who the Father is except the Son, and he to whom the Son wills to reveal the Father
The Son in 10:21 praised the Father that He has 'hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to babes'
Of considering ourselves wise and intelligent, we should regard ourselves as babes, as those who are not knowledgeable
Concerning the Son, only the Father has such knowledge, and concerning the Father, only the Son has such knowledge
Luke 10:23 and 24 say, 'And turning to the disciples, He said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see
Concerning this we should notice that in verse 21 the Lord speaks of 'these things,' and in verse 22, of 'all things'
The Lord exulted in the Holy Spirit that the Father has hid these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to babes
Following this, He privately told the disciples that their eyes were blessed for seeing the things that they see
We have seen that the seventy returned with joy, rejoicing that the demons were subject to them in the Lord's name
The Lord told them not to rejoice that the spirits were subject to them, but to rejoice that their names are inscribed in the heavens
Finally, He told them that they were blessed for seeing and hearing the things that they were able to see and hear
The fourteen Epistles of Paul are needed to describe what is involved in the inscribing of our names in the heavens
God in His wisdom has ordained and prepared for us many deep and hidden things, such as justification, sanctification, and glorification
In chapter ten of the Gospel of Luke the Lord Jesus goes quite far in touching the mysterious things that are unveiled in Paul's Epistles
Rather, the reality of the jubilee is that we are brought into what was ordained for us by God before the foundation of the world
God chose us and predestinated us to enjoy His eternal plan, a plan that is carried out in His New Testament economy
He has also predestinated us to enjoy all the things related to His economy, the things that are fully unveiled in the Epistles of Paul
The inscribing of our names in the heavens, therefore, points to all the mysteries revealed in Paul's Epistles
If we want a thorough understanding of these things, all things, and the things, we need to go to the Epistles of Paul
The Assyrians captured Samaria and brought people from Babylon and other heathen countries to the cities of Samaria
In John 8:48 certain Jews said to the Lord, 'Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon'?
To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded in the coming age with the enjoyment of the divine life in the manifestation of the kingdom
To be saved is to have God's life enter into us, whereas to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to enter into God's life
According to the New Testament, to receive eternal life is one thing, and to inherit eternal life is another thing
When the scribe asked the Man-Savior about what he should do to inherit eternal life, the Lord said to him, 'What is written in the law?
In the parable that follows, the Lord answered the lawyer by showing him that he did not need a neighbor to love
The man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho fell among robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead
These robbers signify the legalistic teachers of the Judaic law , who used the law to rob the lawkeepers like the self-justified lawyer
The lawyer is likened to the one going down from Jerusalem to Jericho who fell among these robbers and was stripped and beaten by them
In the parable, a priest was going down in the same way, but he was unable to render any help to the beaten one
Verse 32 says, 'And likewise also a Levite, coming down to the place and observing him, passed by on the opposite side'
Under the blindness of self-justification, he did not know that he himself needed a neighbor, the Man-Savior, to love him
The Greek words rendered, 'the one who showed mercy to him' may also be translated, 'the one who dealt mercifully with him'
The self-justified one was helped to know that he needed a loving neighbor to love him, not a neighbor to be loved by him
The giving of the Spirit, divine life, the blessing, and the repayment of the church are all related to the divine attributes
It is difficult to clearly distinguish them by categories, because they are mingled to produce the highest standard of morality
In the parable of the good Samaritan we see that the morality of the Man-Savior was a morality of the highest standard
In this parable we clearly see that the Man-Savior carried out His ministry in His human virtues with His divine attributes
Immediately after the parable of the good Samaritan Luke puts the record of the Man-Savior being received by Martha at Bethany
The connection is that after we have been saved through realizing the Savior's compassion and love, we should serve Him
According to the record of the Gospels, in the Lord's last visit to Jerusalem, He remained in the city only during the day for His ministry
It is quite significant that this story of Martha and Mary follows immediately after the parable of the good Samaritan
The Savior's compassion and love are for our salvation by Him; the Lord's desire and preference are for our service to Him
For our salvation we need to realize the Savior's compassion and love; for our service we need to know the Lord's desire and preference
Do you think that when the Lord came into Martha's home in Bethany His desire was to be served with material things?
When we realize the Savior's compassion and love, we shall enjoy His saving grace, which is full of human virtues and divine attributes
Although there is no need for us to do anything to be saved, fallen man thinks that he must do many things for his salvation
Once we have been convinced by the Savior's compassion and love and are saved, we may try to do many things for the Lord
She was simply sitting at the Lord's feet and listening to His word, and the Lord seemed to appreciate Mary's silence
Having heard and received the Lord's word concerning His death, she looked for the opportunity to anoint Him before He died
The only one who had a heart for the Lord's word concerning His death and who sat quietly listening to His word was Mary
The two cases in 10:25-42, the Lord's portraying Himself as the good Samaritan and His being received by Martha, are related
The first shows the Savior's compassion and love for our salvation, and the second reveals His desire and preference for our service to Him
There is no need for us to do anything for our salvation, and we should not do anything in ourselves in the Lord's service
We shall know the Man-Savior's compassion and love for our salvation and His desire and preference for our service
In nature Mary was rebellious, but she became submissive not only to the Lord's compassion and love but also to His desire and preference
In composing his Gospel, Luke put the Lord's portraying Himself as the good Samaritan together with His being received by Martha at Bethany
Luke's purpose in doing this was to show how to receive the Lord's salvation and how to serve Him after we have been saved
The Gospel of Luke is based upon the fact that the Lord has two essences-the divine essence and the human essence
We need to keep these three matters in mind in reading the Gospel of Luke, for they will help us understand this Gospel
In this mingling, however, the Man-Savior loses neither the divine nature, the nature of God, nor the human nature, the nature of man
As the complete God He has the divine nature with the divine attributes and as a perfect man He has the human nature with the human virtues
These elements include the Lord's divine nature with its divine attributes and His human nature with its human virtues
Now we must go on to see that apart from chapter eleven it would be difficult for us to experience the jubilee
If we read this section carefully again and again, we shall see that prayer means that we pray ourselves into God
When some hear this, they may say, 'We cannot find such a point in the pattern of prayer set up by the Lord Jesus in His teaching
Give us each day our bread for the day; and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone indebted to us
My conclusion is that if we would pray this way again and again, the result will be that we shall pray ourselves into God
Because we are easily distracted from God, we should spend time every morning with Him, praying ourselves into Him
Regarding the commandments in the Scriptures for which the requirements have not been fulfilled, we need to ask
After giving His disciples a brief word of instruction concerning prayer, the Lord went on to give an illustration of praying persistently
To ask is to pray in a common way, to seek is to supplicate in a specific way, and to knock is to reach the door in the closest way
The Lord's word in 11:11-13 indicates that our intention in prayer should be to seek the life supply, to seek loaves, fish, and eggs
Loaves represent the riches of the land; fish, the riches of the sea; and eggs the riches of something both in the air and on the earth
Loaves, fish, and eggs represent the riches of the land, the water, and the air; that is, these represent different kinds of riches
After we have prayed ourselves into God, then, as those in God, we receive the life supply as indicated by the loaves, the fish, and the egg
The point is that when you pray for healing you should observe the governing principle of prayer and pray yourself into God
If your way of praying distracts you from the Lord and does not bring you into Him, you should change your way of praying
We know from our experience with the Lord that often we have prayed properly and have prayed ourselves into God
Dumbness by demon possession signifies the inability to speak for God and praise God due to the worship of dumb idols
The speaking of the mute man here signifies the recovery of the speaking and praising ability by being filled with the Lord in the spirit
It was changed in contempt by the Jews to Baalzebel, which means lord of the dunghill, and used for the ruler of the demons
He has his authority and his angels , who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world
To cast out the demons does not need the hand of God nor the arm of God ; just the finger of God is powerful enough to do this
We see the matter of praying ourselves into God and remaining in Him to receive the life supply, the riches of the Holy Spirit
The Lord is so strong that in order to cast out demons it is not necessary for Him to use His arm or even His hand
If we are those who pray ourselves into God and remain in Him to receive the life supply, we shall be one with the Man-Savior
The believers as a lighted lamp should not be covered by the bushel, an item pertaining to eating, which causes anxiety
Verse 37 says, 'Now as He spoke, a Pharisee asked Him if He would have a meal with him; and He went in and reclined at the table'
The Pharisee's reaction gave the Lord an opportunity to unveil something to the hypocritical Pharisees and lawyers
In verse 41 the Lord goes on to say, 'But give the things which are within as alms, and behold, all things are clean to you'
The word 'within' here refers to the contents of the cup and the platter , signifying what is in the hearts of the Pharisees
The Lord commands them to give as alms what they are coveting in their hearts so that all things may be clean to them
If we put together the four sections of Luke 11, we see a portrait of the Man-Savior with the highest standard of morality
We may say that the 'wisdom of Solomon' in Luke 11:31 indicates the mysteries revealed in the fourteen Epistles of Paul
The contents of God's wisdom are the hidden things of God, the mysteries hidden in God and revealed to us through Paul
In particular, this is the wisdom concerning God's New Testament economy, the wisdom concerning Christ with the church
Chapter eleven of the Gospel of Luke includes a number of matters related to the Man-Savior's highest standard of morality
In order to understand Luke 11 we need the proper understanding of the intrinsic elements of the Gospel of Luke
By praying ourselves into God to enjoy the riches of His supply, we experience the divinity and humanity of Christ
We live a life which is of the highest standard of morality, and this standard of morality enables us to enjoy the New Testament jubilee
As we consider these chapters, we need to realize that our natural understanding of the holy Word is altogether not reliable
In order to understand any book of the Bible, we need to know the principles and elements according to which that book was written
We need to receive these three warnings, warnings that are actually a continuation of the Lord's word in chapter eleven
We need to remember that the Lord's words recorded in chapter eleven were spoken as He was approaching Jerusalem
As the capital of Judea, Jerusalem was characterized by religion and culture with its enjoyment of material things
In Jerusalem the Lord would die to religion and culture; He would die to this present life and all earthly possessions
Since they all came out of a Jewish source, they had a deep appreciation of the Jewish religion and a high regard for the Pharisees
As the genuine followers of the Lord are enjoying the jubilee, they will be opposed by the hypocritical ones in the hypocritical religion
In Jerusalem there was not only the peril of religious hypocrisy, but also the peril of the covetousness of material possessions
Luke 12:13 says, 'And someone out of the crowd said to Him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me'
If we are in the jubilee participating in the New Testament inheritance of the Triune God we need to beware of coveting earthly possessions
Hypocrisy and covetousness are great problems related to the enjoyment of the New Testament jubilee by the genuine followers of Jesus
We should learn to be watchful and faithful, that is, to serve our Lord, who is coming back, with watchfulness and faithfulness
We need to pay careful attention to the third warning, for it concerns our participation in the jubilee in the coming age
In the New Testament the jubilee is of two ages the present age the age of grace and the coming age the age of the kingdom or the millennium
The Lord Jesus was bringing Peter, John, James, and the other disciples into the reality of the jubilee in the age of grace
In the warnings recorded in chapter twelve there is an indication that there will be a further jubilee in the coming age
The Lord seemed to be warning the disciples, 'You are following Me now, and you may participate in the jubilee in this age
We may be in the jubilee in this age, but if we are not faithful in its enjoyment, we will miss the jubilee in the coming age
For this reason, in verses 35 through 38 we have a warning regarding the loss of the jubilee in the coming age
After our inheritance, our right to enjoy the Triune God, has been recovered, we need to be watchful and faithful
While we are enjoying the jubilee in the present age, we need to be watchful and faithful during the Lord's absence
Let us beware of hypocrisy in religion and of the anxiety that causes us to worry about our life, especially about food and clothing
In 12:1-48 the Man-Savior warned His disciples of the hypocrisy of religion , covetousness , and concerning watchfulness and faithfulness
He needed to be released through death; that is, He desired that His divine being would be released through death
These divisions come from the fire which is the impulse of the spiritual life, and this impulse comes from the Lord's released divine life
The cup signified that His death was the God-given portion for Him to take for the sinners whom He would redeem for God
Baptism denoted that His death was the God-ordained way for Him to pass through for the accomplishment of God's redemption for sinners
His divine life, after being released through His physical death, became the impulse of His believers' spiritual life in resurrection
The conflict between the satanic life and the divine life is actually a warfare between the kingdom of Satan and the kingdom of God
In the same principle, the human kingdom depends on the human life, and the kingdom of God depends on the life of God
In Luke 12:52 the Lord continues, 'From now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three'
The kind of division described here is not pleasant, for it is due to the struggle between two lives, the divine life and the satanic life
Now that we understand the thought conveyed in these verses, we should not do anything to start a war in our family
You know how to discern the face of the earth and the heaven; how is it then that you do not discern this time'?
The Greek words rendered 'how is it then that you do not discern' may also be rendered 'but this time you do not know how to discern'
The Greek word translated 'copper coin' is lepton, the second smallest coin of the Greco-Roman coinage of Palestine
The 'judge' will be the Lord, the 'officer' will be the angel, and the 'prison' will be the place of discipline
We follow other versions to use the word 'now,' not to convey the element of time but to indicate continuation
Now' indicates that 13:1-9 continues the last verses of chapter twelve, dealing further with the matter of repentance
He goes on to refer to a second case, the case of the 'eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them'
In verses 6 through 9 the Lord goes on to tell the parable of a certain man who had a fig tree planted in his vineyard
The word 'and' at the beginning of verse 6 indicates that these verses are the continuation of the foregoing verses concerning repentance
The passages in 11:29-32 and 42-52, unveiling the Jewish people as an evil generation, confirm this interpretation
The vinedresser, the Lord Jesus, begged the Father not to do this until, by means of His death, He dug around the tree
Because the Jews did not repent, even after the Lord Jesus died and resurrected and the Spirit came, the 'fig tree' was 'cut down'
In 13:10-17 we have the case of the Man-Savior healing and releasing a bent-double and Satan-bound woman on the Sabbath
Behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years; and she was bent double and utterly unable to stand erect'
We see that the woman did not ask the Lord to heal her rather He initiated the healing and release of the bentdouble and Satanbound woman
We see that Satan uses not only the evil spirit to possess the woman, but also the religious ruler to oppose the woman's release by the Lord
Does not each one of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away, and give it a drink?
When the Lord Jesus healed the woman who had been bound by Satan and bent double, He brought the jubilee to her
In chapter four He had declared the jubilee, in which the captives would be released and the oppressed would be set free
Here He talks to the disciples concerning the kingdom in a negative way, teaching them about the kingdom as a grain of mustard and as leaven
The fact that this mustard seed grew into a tree indicates that it did not grow into something according to its own kind
Contrary to the law of God's creation that every plant must be after its kind, its nature and function were changed
The birds of heaven here must refer to Satan's evil spirits with the evil persons and things motivated by them
The Lord Jesus, in particular, does not use the word leaven in a positive sense, but always in a negative sense
The church, as the practicality of the kingdom of God with Christ-the unleavened fine flour-as its content, must be unleavened bread
What is described in Luke 13:20 and 21 corresponds to the fourth of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the church in Thyatira
The proclamation of the jubilee in chapter four is a governing principle both for Luke's writing of this book and our understanding of it
Whatever is mentioned in chapters four through twenty-four is related to the jubilee either directly or indirectly
In 13:22-30 we have the Lord's teaching on the way to Jerusalem concerning the entrance into the kingdom of God
The record in 13:22-30 is according to Luke's way of putting various points together to show us aspects of the jubilee
Luke 13:22 and 23 say, 'And He was passing throughout the cities and villages, teaching and making His way toward Jerusalem
Gentiles will come from east and west and from north and south and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God
The 'first who will be last' refers to the believing Jews who will believe in the Lord later than the Gentile believers
Verse 31 says, 'In the same hour some Pharisees came up, saying to Him, Get out and go from here, for Herod wants to kill you'
In 13:34 and 35 the Lord says, 'Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets and stones those who have been sent to her!
Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord, the One who will bring in the enjoyment of the jubilee in the millennium!
In 14:1-6 we see that a Pharisee invited the Lord Jesus to eat in his home, and the Lord accepted this invitation
They may have thought that the sabbatical regulations were right and that the religion of keeping the Sabbath was also right
The Lord did this purposely in order to show His disciples that He was not going to Jerusalem for the sake of the Sabbath-keeping religion
While the Lord Jesus was in the house of the Pharisee, He observed the situation among the Pharisees and lawyers
The Lord concludes this parable by saying Because everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled and he who humbles himself shall be exalted
Those mentioned in verse 13-the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind-are the people whom God invited to His salvation
The resurrection of the righteous spoken of in verse 14 is the resurrection of life , when God will reward the saints at the Lord's return
One of those reclining at the table with Him, hearing these things, said to Him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God'!
God, as the certain man, has prepared His full salvation as a great dinner and sent the first apostles as His slaves to invite the Jews
After that, because there was still room in God's salvation, God sent His slaves into the Gentile world to gather more people into His feast
Eventually those who had first been invited by Godthe Pharisees the scribes and the lawyerswill not be able to enter into the kingdom of God
God's economy, however, includes more than salvation, It also includes the reward of entering into the blessing of the kingdom age
God's salvation is for us to enjoy the jubilee today, and His reward is for us to enjoy the jubilee in the coming age
The enjoyment of the jubilee in eternity in the new heaven and new earth will be the full taste of God's full salvation
In order to receive the reward of the jubilee in the coming age, we need to enjoy Christ faithfully in this age
For this reason, God has set up a reward as an incentive that we may enjoy Christ faithfully in this present age
The kingdom will be a reward in the thousand years to the faithful enjoyers of Christ, and that reward will also be a jubilee
Many Jews have excused themselves from accepting God's invitation and have denied this jubilee and as a result cannot share its enjoyment
The kingdom of God, which is Christ Himself, has set us free from the bondage of sin, Satan, the world, and the self
The kingdom of God has also recovered our right to the divine inheritance, the right to enjoy the Triune God in Christ
Properly and faithfully we need to enjoy God's Son who is the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit
Receiving this reward requires the fulfillment of a condition, and this condition is that we faithfully and continually enjoy Christ today
We have received God's salvation, but we must fulfill the requirement in verse 26 in order to receive the reward
In verse 27 the Lord goes on to say, 'Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me, cannot be My disciple'
After being organically united with Him through faith they should remain on the cross keeping their old man in the termination of the cross
The believers in Him have been crucified first and then carry the cross so that they may remain in the termination of their old man
As we remain in this crucifixion, this termination, we carry our own cross and experience and enjoy Christ as our jubilee
Otherwise, we shall be a failure and become the tasteless salt to be thrown out of the glorious realm to a sphere of shame
In verse 33 the Lord says, 'So therefore, everyone of you who does not renounce all his own possessions cannot be My disciple'
To the corrupted earth, the followers of the Lord Jesus should be such an element keeping the earth from being fully corrupted
They have been saved from eternal perdition, but they did not renounce the earthly things and have lost their function in the kingdom of God
We have pointed out that the 'soil' refers to the church as God's farm issuing in the coming kingdom and that the manure pile signifies hell
Why, then, does He in verse 26 apparently teach us to hate our father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and even ourselves?
The reason for His teaching here is that this kind of love often frustrates us from the proper and faithful enjoyment of Christ
The Lord does not teach us to hate persons, but He does teach us to hate the distractions, frustrations, hindrances, and obstacles
If we do not have a hatred for what frustrates our enjoyment of Christ, we shall be disqualified from enjoying the jubilee in the coming age
A person who is truly saved and yet is not faithful in enjoying Christ will be fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile
We have seen that the soil signifies God's farm, which is the church, and the church will issue in the coming kingdom
You certainly will not be fit for hell, the manure pile, because the Lord's blood has washed you and you have been saved
Salt that is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile will be thrown out of the glory of the coming kingdom
The Lord's word in Luke 14 clearly reveals that in addition to God's salvation there is the reward in the coming kingdom
We may be in the jubilee today, but, if we do not fulfill the requirement set down by the Lord, we shall miss the jubilee in the coming age
Next, the jubilee requires that we accept God's invitation and take what He offers us so that we may be saved to enjoy His rich Christ
The Lord was going to Jerusalem in order to die so that through His death and resurrection He might bring in the jubilee
On the way to Jerusalem He encountered frustration from the religious people, especially from the Pharisees and lawyers
Many of the cases that took place on the way from Galilee to Jerusalem are related to the frustration caused by the religious ones
All three parables emphasize the love of the Divine Trinity more than the fallen condition and repentance of the penitent sinner
Clearly, the shepherd refers to the Son, the woman refers to the Spirit, and the father refers to the heavenly Father
In Luke we first have the Son as the shepherd, then the Spirit as the woman, and finally the Father as the father receiving his returned son
The Son comes to accomplish redemption, which is the first need, because redemption is the foundation of our salvation
After the accomplishment of redemption by the Son, we see from the book of Acts that the Spirit comes to seek us and find us
The shepherd going into the wilderness to seek the lost sheep indicates that the Son has come to the world to be with men
The lamp signifies the word of God used by the Spirit to enlighten and expose the sinner's position and condition so that he may repent
In verse 9 the Greek words 'friends' and 'neighbors' are feminine, differing from friends and neighbors in verse 6, which are masculine
Verses 14 and 15 say, 'And when he had spent all, a severe famine occurred throughout that country, and he began to be in want
He went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed hogs'
Verse 16 says, 'And he was longing to be satisfied with the carob pods which the hogs were eating, and no one gave him anything'
In verse 19 we see that the prodigal intended to say to his father, 'I am no longer worthy to be called your son
The father said to his slaves, Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet'
According to verse 22, the father also told the slaves to put a ring on his son's hand and sandals on his feet
In verse 23 the father goes on to say to the slaves, 'And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry'
Christ as our righteousness is our outward salvation; Christ as our life for our enjoyment is our inward salvation
The best robe qualifies the prodigal son to match his father's requirements and satisfy his father; the fattened calf satisfies his hunger
In verses 31 and 32 we have the father's response to the older son: 'Child, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours
We had to be merry and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive, and was lost and was found'
In 15:8-10 we have the Spirit as the woman lighting a lamp, sweeping the house, and seeking carefully for a lost silver coin
In the parable of the loving father, the father must have been outside the door of his dwelling when he saw his son approaching
According to this interpretation, when a sinner repents and comes back to God, one day God will receive him into a heavenly mansion
It is not logical to say that we have come back to the Father and He has received us and yet we are still not in His house
If this house signifies heaven then where are we who have been saved and who have been received by the Father since we are not yet in heaven
In these three parables the Son came into the wilderness, the Spirit came into our being, and the Father receives us into His house
The fact that the Spirit's finding us takes place within the 'house' of our being reveals that we were lost in ourselves
The best robe put on the son is a full type of Christ as our righteousness in whom we are justified before God
The sandals put on the son's feet signify that God's salvation separates us from the world and unto Him so that we may then take His way
The outward aspect is Christ as our righteousness to justify us, and the inward aspect is Christ as our life and life supply to satisfy us
In 15:3 we see that the Lord spoke these parables to the Pharisees and scribes in the presence of the tax collectors and sinners
The religious ones must have been unhappy, but the tax collectors and typical sinners must have been filled with rejoicing
In the four gospels only in chapter fifteen of Luke do we have the picture concerning God's salvation worked out by the Divine Trinity
In Luke 15 we see that the sinners are blessed, whereas the dissenting religious ones remain in their foolishness
Now we are no longer in the wilderness and no longer in the 'house' of the self-now we are in the Father's house, the church
On the negative side, the prodigal is released from bondage; on the positive side, he begins to enjoy the riches of the Father's inheritance
In the Gospel of Luke we see that whenever the Lord Jesus speaks of salvation, He goes on further to reveal something concerning the service
The steward says he is not strong enough to dig as a farmer digging in the field, and he is ashamed to beg as a beggar begging for help
Verses 5 through 7 say, 'And he called to him each one of his lord's debtors and said to the first, How much do you owe my lord?
In verse 8 the Lord Jesus explains that the sons of this age are more prudent than the sons of light in their own generation
To make friends by means of mammon is to help others by the use of money to do things according to God's leading
The word 'fails' indicates that when the satanic world is over, mammon will be of no use in the kingdom of God
In verse 11 the Lord says, 'If therefore you have not become faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you the true'?
It is not God's intent in His New Testament economy for the New Testament believers to care for material possessions
The Lord indicates that to serve Him requires us to love Him, giving our hearts to Him, and cleave to Him, giving our entire being to Him
In the Life-study of Mark we pointed out that the seed of the kingdom in Mark 4 may be called the kingdom gene
When the Lord Jesus comes back and we are received into His kingdom, some of us will have a number of people welcoming us
Suppose you use an amount of your money to publish gospel tracts for the purpose of bringing people to the Lord
In the same principle, while we are still on the way to the kingdom, we should use our money for the benefit of others
Certain groups require their members to pledge ten percent of their income, and these groups always have money in abundance
Those who give to the Lord faithfully and consistently can testify that the more they give, the more they receive
When some hear this word about faithfulness and giving, they may say that they do not have enough faith to give consistently
We have seen that in 16:1-13 the Lord teaches about the prudence of a steward, in particular, about prudence in the proper handling of money
In verses 17 and 18 the Lord says to the Pharisees But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one serif of the law to fall
You need to realize that now is no longer the dispensation of the law, but the dispensation of the acceptable year of the Lord
On the other hand, they were somewhat happy in that they may have thought that they no longer needed to keep the law
Today a large percentage of wealthy professional men have been divorced at least once, and a number have been divorced more than once
Luke 16:19 says, 'Now a certain man was rich, and clothed himself in purple and fine linen, making merry splendidly every day'
Through this story the Lord warns them by unveiling that their miserable future will be like that of the rich man
In this story the rich man habitually clothed himself in purple and linen and made merry splendidly, sumptuously, every day
Hades is not an eternal abode for people in the next life; Hades is a place where disembodied spirits are kept temporarily
There are two sections in Hades: the section of comfort, a pleasant section, for the saved, and the section of torment for the unsaved
The Lord told the thief on the cross who begged the Lord to remember him in His kingdom that he would be with Him in Paradise
As we have pointed out, this Paradise is the pleasant section in Hades, a section of comfort for God's redeemed people
In this story of the rich man and Lazarus the Lord Jesus revealed to the rich Pharisees their destiny, their future
Lazarus, the poor man, went to the section of comfort because he listened to the word of God conveyed in Moses and the prophets
The rich man then said to Abraham, 'No, Father Abraham, but if someone from the dead would go to them, they will repent
He said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead'
If people do not hear what the word of God says, they will not be persuaded even by one who resurrects miraculously from the dead
Even though they offended others, once they themselves were offended by someone, they would never forgive the one who offended them
From this we can see that the teaching in 17:1-10 was given by the Lord over against the background provided by the Pharisees
In any kind of circumstance or environment, we need to exercise our faith, believing in God and trusting Him for everything
Although we may be somewhat useful and profitable, weshould humble ourselves and not think of ourselves as being useful
It is still necessary for him to go to the kitchen, prepare food for his master, and serve him so that he may be satisfied
According to this admonition, it is possible for us first to build up and then to tear down more than what we have built up
On the one hand, some servants of the Lord stumble others, and, on the other hand, are easily offended by others
According to the Lord's word in 17:4, even if a brother sins against us seven times a day, we should always be ready to forgive him
In addition to being careful not to offend and being ready to forgive, we need to exercise faith in God under all kinds of circumstances
Luke 17:11-13 says, 'And it came about as He was going to Jerusalem, that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee
We know from chapter ten of the Gospel of Luke that while the Lord was on the way through Samaria, He was rejected in Samaria
In the Lord's answer to the Pharisees, there is a strong indication that the kingdom of God is actually the Savior Himself
Christ will also be clothed with a cloud in the air for a time, and then He will suddenly appear like a flash to the earth
People will be stupefied by the necessities of this life, not knowing that God's judgment will come upon them by the Lord's coming
The believers, however, should be dedrugged and soberly know that the Lord is coming to execute God's judgment upon this corrupted world
Due to man's lust, Satan utilizes these necessities of human life to occupy man and keep him from God's interests
Toward the end of this age, this situation will be intensified and will reach its climax during the days of the Son of Man
The characteristics of this generation are eating, drinking, marrying, giving in marriage, buying, selling, planting, and building
In verse 30 the Lord goes on to say, 'It will be in the same way on the day in which the Son of Man is revealed'
The Greek words translated 'it will be in the same way' literally mean, 'according to the same things it will be'
In 17:31-36 the Lord indicates that the kingdom of God is related to Him and the rapture of His overcoming believers
By the time of the rapture, the 'air,' the indwelling Christ, will rapture us, the 'balloon' filled with this air, this pneuma
That look indicated that she loved and treasured the evil world which God was about to judge and utterly destroy
If we love the Lord and are warned by the case of Lot's wife, we shall not care for material things or set our hearts on them
In 17:34 and 35 the Lord says, 'I tell you, in that night there will be two on one couch; the one will be taken, and the other will be left
Those who are taken in this way will be raptured before the great tribulation , which will be a severe trial upon the whole inhabited earth
Although the believers should not be stupefied by the necessities of this life, they need to work for a living
When the rapture takes place some will be raptured in the night and others will be raptured in the day depending on where they live on earth
Perhaps the saints in the Far East will be raptured in the night, and the saints in the West will be raptured in the day
The Pharisees asked the Lord as to when the kingdom of God comes, and His answer is given in all the following verses
Now we have the full answer of the Lord to the question asked by the Pharisees regarding the coming of the kingdom of God
The answer is that when the Son of God came the first time the kingdom came with Him and when He went to the cross the kingdom went with Him
As the Savior was going from Galilee to Jerusalem, He was training His followers to know the economy of God concerning the jubilee
For the sake of the jubilee, it was necessary for Christ to die to accomplish an all-inclusive redemption and then enter into resurrection
Through His all-inclusive redemption Christ has fulfilled the requirements for us to be released from every kind of bondage
It was necessary for Him to be resurrected to bring us positively into the enjoyment of the divine inheritance
In this message we shall seek to cover the problem presented by an unrighteous judge being used to signify the righteous God
In a sense, the believers in Christ are a widow in the present age because their Husband Christ is absent from them
We need to consider the parable in 18:1-8 in the context of the lengthy record of the Lord's journey from Galilee to Jerusalem
All these matters are related either directly or indirectly to the kingdom of God and to the enjoyment of Christ
The people of the world are busy with marrying and giving in marriage, with buying and selling, with planting and building
They even need to hate their own soul life, for they should hate anything that distracts them from the enjoyment of Christ
While our opposer is persecuting us, it seems that our God is not righteous, for He allows His children to be unrighteously persecuted
Throughout the centuries, thousands upon thousands of honest and faithful followers of the Man-Savior have suffered unrighteous persecution
What shall we do in a situation when we are persecuted and it seems that our God is not living, present, or just?
In figure, the altar is in the outer court of the tabernacle and the temple, and the outer court signifies the earth
Often the children of those who are faithful followers of the Lord ask their parents why they are suffering persecution
When our Husband is apparently absent and we are left on earth as a widow, temporarily our God seems to be an unrighteous judge
Although He appears to be unrighteous, we still must appeal to Him, pray persistently, and bother Him again and again
What is covered in these verses may be considered the condition and requirements for entering into the kingdom of God
In verse 14 the Lord says, 'Everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted'
His word in verse 12 about fasting and paying tithes does not sound like a prayer, but rather like an arrogant boast to God
He asked God to be propitiated, to be appeased toward him by a propitiation, so that God may be merciful and gracious to him
The Greek word for propitiation is hilasterion, different from hilasmos in 1 John 2:2 and 4:10 and hilaskomai in Hebrews 2:17
The Lord offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins , not only for our redemption but also for God's satisfaction
In Hebrews 2:17 the Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God's righteous demands on us
The Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to appease Gods righteousness to reconcile us by satisfying the demand of Gods righteousness
The propitiatory or expiatory sacrifice, which foreshadowed Christ, satisfied all the requirements of God's righteousness and glory
It is significant, therefore, that the tax collector in Luke 18:13 said, 'God, be propitiated to me, the sinner'!
He realized that he had offended God and that he needed someone to be his offering of propitiation so that God would be appeased
In verses 16 and 17 the Lord Jesus says, 'Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God
In 18:18-30 we see that if we would enter into the kingdom of God, we need to renounce all and follow the Man-Savior
Verses 24 and 25 say, 'And Jesus observing him said, How difficult it is for those who hold on to riches to go into the kingdom of God
For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God'
To enter into this enjoyment in the coming age is to enter into the coming kingdom and participate in its enjoyment of eternal life
When Peter made the statement recorded in verse 28, he was not yet in the kingdom, but he was at least standing on the threshold
While the Man-Savior was making the long journey from Galilee to Jerusalem, He spoke to His disciples about many things
Luke 18:34 says, 'And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know what was being said'
We may compare the ManSaviors word to His disciples concerning His death to beautiful music played to those who do not appreciate such music
The reason for their inability to understand was that they were altogether in another kingdom, in their own kingdom
The Lord's unveiling of His death and resurrection the third time is related to the healing of the blind man near Jericho
They could not understand what the Lord was saying about His death and resurrection, because they were lacking in perception and insight
Following the third unveiling of the Lord's death and resurrection, we have the case of the healing of a blind man
Luke 18:35 says, 'And it came about as He drew near to Jericho, that a certain blind man was sitting by the road, begging'
In chapter ten Luke is not concerned with geography or historical sequence; he is concerned with the high standard of morality
These two cases, occurring at Jericho in direct continuation, should be considered spiritually as one complete case
What is covered in 18:35-19:10 shows how one can fulfill the conditions, as revealed in 18:9-30, for entering the kingdom of God
These conditions are first to receive sight from the Savior and then to receive the Savior as the dynamic salvation
When the blind man near Jericho heard that Jesus was passing by, he cried, saying, 'Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me'!
Although they saw so much on the mountain, actually, in a spiritual sense, they did not see anything at all, for they were blind
We may think that such a case belongs much earlier in the book, perhaps in the section that records the Lord's ministry in Galilee
In chapter eighteen, when the Lord is very close to Jerusalem, we have the account of the healing of this blind man
Luke 19:2 says, 'And behold, there was a man whose name was called Zaccheus; and he was a chief tax collector and he was rich'
According to Luke 19:3-6, in order to see the Lord Jesus, Zaccheus, who was small in stature, climbed up in a sycamore tree
The tax collectors used to put a higher value on property or income, or increase the tax of those unable to pay, and then charge usury
In Luke 19:9 the Lord Jesus went on to say to Zaccheus, 'Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham'
Evil this tax collector was, he was nonetheless also a son of Abraham, a chosen heir of God's promised inheritance
He came to Jericho purposefully to seek this unique lost sinner, just as He sought the sinful woman in Samaria
Tax collectors put a higher value on property or increased the tax of those unable to pay and then charged high interest
A man who had become rich by being sinful, Zaccheus now wanted to make full restitution in order to clear up his sinful past
Luke 19:3 and 4 say, 'And he was seeking to see Jesus, who He is; and he could not because of the crowd, for he was small in stature
He ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree that he might see Him, for He was about to pass through that way'
Zaccheus could utter such a word even though he had not heard the Man-Savior's teaching concerning material possessions
In 14:33 the Savior went on to say, 'Everyone of you who does not renounce all his own possessions cannot be My disciple'
In chapter sixteen He spoke to His disciples concerning the mammon of unrighteousness and then issued a warning to the rich
In the case of the saving of Zaccheus in Jericho, we see that the Lord's salvation is actually the Lord Himself
We have pointed out that Zaccheus responded to the Man-Savior in the way he did because of the dynamic power of His salvation
In chapter four He declared that the Spirit of the Lord was upon Him because He had been anointed to proclaim release to the captives
In the sight of the religious people, especially the Pharisees, Zaccheus was a leading sinner, for he was a chief tax collector
Before he climbed up the tree to see the Savior, Zaccheus may have given much consideration to how to be released from his sinful condition
As a Jew, he must have been condemned in his conscience for working as a tax collector to gather taxes for the Roman imperialists
He may have tried to get out of his sinful condition, but he was unable to do so, for he was a captive and was oppressed
The Savior told Zaccheus, 'I must stay in your house,' and John 4:4 says of Him, 'He had to pass through Samaria'
When the Lord came into the house of Zaccheus, that was a jubilee not only for an individual but for the entire household
We may say that the case of the healing of the blind man near Jericho and the case of the saving of Zaccheus in Jericho are one
In the first case the blind man receives sight from the Savior, and in the second case Zaccheus receives the Savior as dynamic salvation
Now he can enjoy the Savior and the kingdom of God, for now he is in the kingdom of God and enjoying this kingdom as his jubilee
Verse 12 continues He said therefore A certain man of noble birth went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return
In the parable in Matthew 25:14-30 the slaves are given a varying number of talents according to their individual ability
The point of both parables is the same: the faithfulness of the slaves will determine their portion in the coming kingdom as their reward
Verse 14 says, 'But his citizens hated him and sent an envoy after him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us'
Their declaring that they did not want the Lord to reign over them was fulfilled in Acts chapters two through nine
He said to him, Well done, good slave; because you became faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities'
The word 'held' in verse 20 signifies how the unfaithful believers keep their salvation in an idle way instead of using it productively
He seemingly demands us to work for Him with nothing, taking up what He did not lay down and reaping what He did not sow
Verses 24 through 26 continue, 'And to those standing by he said, Take the mina away from him, and give it to the one who has ten minas
The taking away of the mina signifies that the Lord's gift will be taken away from slothful believers in the coming kingdom
From him who has not gained profit in the church age, even the gift he has will be taken away from him in the coming kingdom age
We see the same matter in chapter ten, where the case of Martha and Mary follows the parable of the good Samaritan
The one who gains ten minas will have authority over ten cities, and the one who gains five minas will be over five cities
Ruling over ten cities or five cities is part of the enjoyment of the jubilee, part of the enjoyment of the recovered birthright
As we have pointed out, the jubilee today is a foretaste, and the jubilee in the next age will be a fuller enjoyment
Inheriting the earth and ruling over cities will be our enjoyment of the kingdom of God, Christ, and the jubilee
Luke, however, emphasizes this again and again, in chapters fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, and once more in nineteen
Now we come to the fourth section of this Gospel-the Man-Savior's presentation of Himself to death for redemption
After completing His ministry in Galilee, the Man-Savior began to make the long journey from Galilee to Jerusalem
The Lord's transfiguration signifies that all His followers need to be transformed in order to share in the enjoyment of the jubilee
We must overcome all distractions and frustrations so that we may love Him to the uttermost and serve Him faithfully
We shall be qualified to enter into the kingdom in the coming age and have the full participation of the jubilee in the millennium
We all need to see that enjoying Christ as the kingdom of God in this age qualifies us to enjoy Him as the jubilee in the next age
Thousands and even millions of those who believe in the Lord and who have received His salvation do not enjoy Him
In this message we shall begin to consider the fourth section of this book-the Man-Savior's presentation of Himself to death for redemption
In the book of Leviticus the offerings offered on the altar are types of Christ, and in the New Testament fulfillment the altar is the cross
The Bible reveals that Christ is not only the offerings, but also the offering Priest to offer the sacrifice to God
The Lord Jesus was not arrested by the Pharisees in Galilee and then brought by them to Jerusalem to be put to death
The Lord went on to tell the disciples that if they were asked why they were untying the colt, they should say, 'Because the Lord needs it'
That miracle took place shortly before the feast of the Passover which was the time for the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God to be put to death
Not long before He was killed, He raised Lazarus from the dead, and that miracle caused many to crowd around Him
In 19:42-44 we see what the Lord said as He wept over the city: 'If you knew in this day, even you, the things that are for your peace!
The word 'visitation' in verse 44 refers to the Savior's first coming to visit them in grace in the acceptable year of the Lord
On His journey from Galilee to Jerusalem, the Lord emphasized the need to overcome mammon and material possessions
He even said that in order to follow Him we need to renounce our possessions and stay away from the stupefying effects of material things
Because what He required His disciples to renounce was prevailing in the temple, He went into the temple to cleanse it
The Lord's cleansing of the temple indicates that His presenting of Himself on the cross to God was for the producing of a cleansed temple
The New Testament reveals that the Lord Jesus died to produce many grains that would be formed into one loaf, which is the Body
When He was twelve, He was found in the temple , and when He came forth to minister at the age of thirty, He cleansed the temple
Before presenting Himself in this way, He once again expressed His concern for the interests of His Father, for the Father's dwelling place
We have seen that the Lord entered into Jerusalem triumphantly , lamented over the city , and cleansed the temple and taught in it
The year in which the Man-Savior went up to Jerusalem to die was the very year prophesied in the ninth chapter of Daniel
Even more specifically, the Lord was to be put to death on the Passover, that is, on the fourteenth day of the month
In the Gospels we see that the Lord Jesus was very careful not to be killed either before or after the appointed time
Since He was the real Passover Lamb, He preserved Himself until the time had come for Him to be offered on the cross
His purpose in going back to the temple was to present Himself to the Jewish people for them to thoroughly examine Him
In 201 we see that as the Lord was teaching in the temple and preaching the good news the chief priests scribes and the elders came to Him
In chapter twenty of the Gospel of Luke we have a picture of the Man-Savior behaving Himself in the highest standard of morality
In His wisdom the Lord said to them, 'I also will ask you one thing, and you tell Me: the baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men'?
Eventually, not having the wisdom to handle the situation, they could do nothing except lie by answering, 'We do not know where it was from'
After the chief priests, scribes, and elders were defeated by the Man-Savior, the Pharisees and the Herodians tested Him
The Herodians took sides with King Herod's regime and took part with him in infiltrating the Jews with Grecian and Roman manners of life
If He said that it was not lawful, He would give the Herodians, who stood with the Roman government, ground to accuse Him
Those who are worthy of the coming age and of the resurrection of the dead will be equal to angels, and there will be no marriage among them
In 20:35 the Lord speaks of those who are counted worthy to obtain the coming age and the resurrection from the dead
From this we see that the divine title-the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob-implies the truth of resurrection
Unlike the Sadducees, who were very superficial, the Lord had the wisdom to penetrate into the depths of the holy Word
In 20:1-38 the Man-Savior is examined by the chief priests, scribes, and elders , by the Pharisees and Herodians , and by the Sadducees
His examiners had only half the scriptural knowledge concerning Christ's Person, that He was the Son of David according to His humanity
The Lord's intention in 20:41-44 was to help His examiners to see that the One they were questioning was actually the Lord
The very Creator of all was surrounded by His creatures and was examined by them in an insidious and insulting way
After muzzling the mouths of all His opposers, the Savior warned His disciples of the hypocrisy and evils of the scribes
He saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury, and 'He saw a certain needy widow putting in two small copper coins'
In the warning against the scribes and in the appraising of the poor widow, Luke once again shows us a high standard of morality
In the words of Exodus 12, He was without blemish; that is, He was altogether perfect, without defect, without spot
He was examined not only by the Pharisees, the religious party, but also by the Herodians, the political party
Before He died, He was tried not only by the Jewish Sanhedrin, but also by Pilate, the Roman governor, and by Herod, the king
When we have the termination of the old creation and the germination of the redeemed ones to be a new creation, we shall be in the jubilee
Zaccheus could renounce riches and material things because he received the living Savior as his dynamic salvation
He was not present when the Lord spoke about this in chapters twelve, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen
After passing through an examination conducted by the opposers, He took some time to prepare His disciples for His death
During those last days in Jerusalem, the Lord prepared His disciples to receive His death and even to participate in it
Because the disciples were boasting about the temple, the Lord told them that what they were gazing at would be destroyed
When you hear of wars and tumults, do not be alarmed, for these things must take place first, but the end is not immediately'
The long history of wars from the time of the ascension until now is a fulfillment of the Lord's word in Luke 21:9
The rising up of nation against nation refers to civil war, and the rising up of kingdom against kingdom refers to international war
Throughout the centuries there have been more and more earthquakes, and earthquakes will be intensified at the end of this age
According to history, war has always brought famine, signified by the black horse of the third seal in Revelation 6:5 and 6
The 'synagogues' indicate persecution in the Jewish land, and 'kings and governors' point to persecution in Gentile lands
Matthew 10:20 says, 'For you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you'
We see that even family members will cause others in the family to be put to death because of their faithfulness to the Lord Jesus
Although they may be persecuted and suffer in both body and soul, that suffering will be a salvation to their souls in the coming age
In the next age, when the kingdom comes, their souls will be saved to enjoy the coming jubilee, and they will share in the joy of the Lord
The Lord's word about possessing our souls by our endurance is related to the enjoyment of the jubilee in the coming age of the kingdom
Verse 20 says, 'But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation has drawn near'
Some Bible teachers have not been clear concerning the difference between the surrounding of Jerusalem by armies in A
Verses 22 and 23 say, 'Because these are days of vengeance, that all the things which have been written may be fulfilled
The 'land' here does not refer to the entire earth; instead, it refers to the land of Palestine, to the holy land
In the following message we shall consider the Lord's word concerning the disciples' redemption and the overcomers' rapture
In this message we shall go on to consider what the Lord says concerning the disciples' redemption and the overcomers' rapture
Paul speaks of this redemption in Romans 8:23: 'Even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body'
The redemption in Luke 2128 the redemption that is drawing near is not the redemption of our spirit or soul but the redemption of our body
In the Bible the word 'near' does not mean that something will happen within a few days or even within several years
The word 'generation' in verse 32 is not the generation according to age or people, as the generations in Matthew 1:17
Rather, this is the generation according to the moral condition of the people, as the generation in Luke 11:29-32 and Proverbs 30:11-14
Dissipation and drunkenness in 21:34 refer to the indulgence of the lustful self in the excess of the enjoyment of eating and drinking
It indicates that the raptured overcomers will stand before the Savior on Mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation
As we have pointed out, to prevail in this way is to have the strength and ability to escape the great tribulation
We have seen that to escape the things that are about to take place is to be raptured before the great tribulation
Trial' here undoubtedly denotes the great tribulation, as indicated by the fifth, sixth, and seventh trumpets with the seven bowls
In Revelation 3:10 the Lord promises the recovered church, the church in Philadelphia, that He will keep her out of the hour of trial
He will keep her not only out of the trial, but also out of the hour of trial, because she has kept the word of the Lord's endurance
There has been much debate among Bible teachers concerning the rapture of the saints and the second coming of the Lord Jesus
Some claim that the rapture will be before the tribulation, and others say that it will take place after the tribulation
According to the Scriptures, we believe not only in the general rapture of all the saints but also in the rapture of the overcomers
The only way for us to stand before the Son of Man on the throne is for us to be raptured, to be taken away to the heavens
In the epistle to the church in Philadelphia, the Lord promises the overcomers that they will be kept from, taken out of, the hour of trial
They will be raptured before the three and a half years of the great tribulation and will not remain on earth to meet Antichrist
Whether or not we shall be raptured before the great tribulation and be taken away to meet Christ on the throne does not depend on Him
No doubt, those who stand before the Son of Man on Mount Zion in the heavens will be beside themselves with joy in the Lord
He knew that He was preparing Himself, His disciples, His opposers, and the environment for the accomplishment of His redemptive death
Rather, the snare is the time of the great tribulation, the hour of trial, which will come upon the whole earth
The prophecies in Daniel concerning the destruction of Jerusalem imply the destruction by Antiochus Epiphanes, Titus, and Antichrist
If we consider the context, we shall see that verse 24 does not refer to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus
During this same period of time, the time between the Lord's ascension and the great tribulation, the followers of Christ will be persecuted
We need to be watchful so that our hearts will not be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness, and the anxieties of the present life
Even by instituting His supper, or what we may call the Lord's table, the Man-Savior was preparing the disciples for His redemptive death
It was crucial, therefore, that the Savior be put to death on the exact day prophesied and typified in the Old Testament
It was not easy for everything to be arranged so that the Man-Savior would be put to death at the exact time and place
In Luke 22 we see that while the Man-Savior was preparing Himself to die, the opposers were busy with their plot, their conspiracy
In particular, Satan was actively using Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve apostles appointed by the Man-Savior
Satan injected into Judas the thought of finding an opportunity to deliver the Lord into the hand of those who wanted to kill Him
In the night of the last Passover day the ManSavior first ate the Passover feast with His disciples and then instituted His supper for them
The Lord longed to eat the Passover with the disciples before He suffered, that is, before He went to the cross
The feast signifying the jubilee was first the feast of the Passover in the Old Testament and then the Lord's table in the New Testament
Not even this New Testament feast has been completely fulfilled; it will be fulfilled completely in the coming kingdom
If we read the Bible carefully, we shall see that a feast is spoken of both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament
The feast in the kingdom will be the fulfillment of both the feast of the Passover and the feast of the Lord's table
Seemingly there are three feasts: the feast of the Passover, the feast of the Lord's table, and the feast in the kingdom
When the Passover was established, the oppressed Israelites were released from bondage in Egypt, released from the tyranny of Pharaoh
On the positive side, the Passover brought them into a feast to enjoy the lamb, which is a symbol of Christ as the embodiment of God
On that day the children of Israel were brought into the enjoyment of God; they enjoyed the lamb and the Passover
After they entered into the good land, they enjoyed the riches of the land, which is a type of Christ in His all-inclusiveness
Now we can see that the Passover set the Israelites free from bondage and brought them into the enjoyment of God
The Lord's table is a sign of the jubilee that sets us free from bondage and brings us into the full enjoyment of the Triune God
The Lord's table is not only a replacement of the Old Testament feast of Passover; it is also a continuation of that feast
In verse 16 the Lord and His disciples ate the Passover feast, and in verse 17 they drank the cup of that feast
It may be helpful to mark our Bibles to indicate that the feast of Passover ends with verse 18 and the Lord's supper begins with verse 19
Verse 20 says And similarly the cup after they had dined saying This cup is the new covenant in My blood which is being poured out for you
The Man-Savior wanted His disciples to know this and live a life based on it and according to it after His resurrection
We have emphasized the fact that the Man-Savior instituted His supper, the Lord's table, after He and the disciples ate the Passover feast
The bread denotes life , the life of God, the eternal life, and the cup denotes blessing , which is God Himself as their portion
They testify of His rich and marvelous salvation to the entire universe and display His redeeming and life-imparting death
In the Lord's table the main item for us to enjoy as New Testament believers is not a lamb; the main item for our enjoyment is bread
What is signified by the loaf is not something before the Lord's death, but something after His death and in His resurrection
We see that the bread signifies not only the physical body of the Savior; it also signifies His mystical Body, which is the church
According to the development elsewhere in the New Testament, the loaf, the bread, signifies the Body of Christ, the church
In the Old Testament feast of the Passover the enjoyment was of the lamb, but in the New Testament feast the enjoyment is of the loaf
Whenever we come to the Lord's table, we should keep in mind that we are not in His death but in His resurrection
The loaf is no longer the individual Christ; it is now the corporate Christ , including the Lord Jesus and the believers
It is not likely that Peter, James, John, and the other disciples understood the significance of the Lord's supper when it was instituted
In His ministry, whether in Galilee or on the way to Jerusalem, the Man-Savior emphasized His death and resurrection
Now with the institution of His supper the most important matter emphasized by Him was again His death and resurrection
It was through His death and resurrection that He terminated the disciples, buried them, redeemed them, and germinated them
At the Lord's table we have the loaf signifying the Body in life, and we have the cup signifying the blessing of the Triune God
For the Son of Man indeed is going according to what has been determined; but woe to that man through whom He is delivered up!
Mark's record is according to historical sequence, whereas Luke's record is according to the sequence of morality
You are not so, but let the greater among you become as the younger, and the one who leads as the one who serves
The table here is the feast in the parable in Matthew 22:1-4 and the marriage feast in Revelation 19:9 for the overcoming saints
The Lord wanted the disciples to care not for the throne or for being great, but to care for the kingdom, the jubilee
The Lord replied, 'I tell you, Peter, a cock will not crow today until you will deny three times that you know Me'
Verses 39 and 40 say, 'And He came out and went according to His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him
According to verse 42, the Lord Jesus prayed, 'Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; however, not My will, but Yours be done'
He was willing to do this unique will of the Father for the accomplishment of the eternal plan of the Triune God
Just as He took the initiative to go from Galilee to Jerusalem, He took the initiative to go to the Garden of Gethsemane
When the Lord Jesus was arrested three categories of people were around Him those who arrested Him His disciples and those who judged Him
When the Lord told the disciples to be prepared to face the situation, they thought that it was necessary for them to buy swords to fight
Because the disciples were in the natural life, they were not able to understand what the Man-Savior was telling them
When the Lord was about to be arrested, 'those around Him, seeing what was about to happen, said, Lord, shall we strike with a sword?
Knowing what they needed, the Lord brought them with Him to the cross so that they could be terminated and replaced
He accepted being arrested in order to accomplish redemption both for His followers and for those who arrested Him
The One they were mocking, beating, and blaspheming was the God-man; the One who suffered this was God in a man
They were excited and, thinking that He was blaspheming God in saying that He was the Son of God, they condemned Him
they were insisting, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee even unto here'
As an officer working for the Roman Empire, he was afraid to offend the Jewish people among whom he was working
It was not easy for any Roman ruler to handle the Jews, and Caesar often complained about the way his officers in Judea handled them
Herod with his soldiers, despising Him and mocking, threw around Him splendid clothing and sent Him back to Pilate'
Crucifixion was a heathen practice , adopted by the Romans for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only
At the same time, they both vindicated the Man-Savior in His highest standard of human perfection with His all-surpassing divine splendor
The judgments by the Jewish leaders and the Roman rulers were the last step of the examination of the Man-Savior
In this portrait we see the God-man, the One who is perfect, dignified, and full of divine splendor and of human virtues
Perhaps we have not appreciated before the portrait of the God-man that is presented in this portion of the Word
From what we see in this picture we cannot give any credit to the eleven disciples especially to Peter John and James in their natural life
As we view the picture presented here of the Lord's disciples, we need to realize that this is a picture of us as well
They came to arrest the Lord not in the daytime but at night, and not in a public place but in a private place
As we consider these pictures, we can understand the situation in the midst of which the God-man went to the cross
We need to come to the honest and accurate record of the Scriptures, especially the record in the Gospel of Luke
He was accused by the religious leaders sentenced to death by Roman rulers especially Pilate and then put on the cross by the Roman soldiers
The rulers were even sneering and saying, He saved others, let him save himself if this is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!
The Lord Jesus was put on the cross at nine o'clock in the morning and remained there until three o'clock in the afternoon
During the first three hours on the cross, the Lord was a victim of human persecution, and He suffered this persecution as a martyr
In 23:26-49 we see two aspects of the Lord's death: the aspect of man's persecution and the aspect of God's judgment
During the last three hours the Lord was on the cross, He was judged by God for the accomplishment of our redemption
In Luke 23:44 and 45 we see two matters accomplished by God: darkness coming over the whole land and the veil of the temple being torn
Because God regarded Him as our Substitute, as the One who bore our sins and was made sin for us in God's sight, God forsook Him
When the Lord Jesus was bearing our sins and was made sin on the cross, He was considered by God to be the Lamb of God
When the Lord Jesus, the God-man, died on the cross under God's judgment, He had God within Him essentially as His divine being
The essential aspect was for the being, the existence, of the Lord Jesus, and the economical aspect was for His work, His ministry
But Jesus turned to them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over Me, but weep over yourselves and over your children
When they came to the place called Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left'
It shows the effectiveness of the Man-Savior's vicarious death and the highest standard of morality of His salvation
In 23:43 'Paradise' denotes the pleasant section in Hades, where the spirits of Abraham and all the just are, awaiting the resurrection
We have seen in the foregoing message that the Man-Savior was put to death as our Substitute, as our Redeemer, by God
According to the record of the entire New Testament, when the Man-Savior died on the cross, He died as seven items
From 1 Corinthians 15:3, 1 Peter 2:24, and Hebrews 9:28 we see that as the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus died for our sins
As a man in the flesh, He had only the likeness, the form, of a fallen man; He did not have the nature of a fallen man
No doubt, the Lord Jesus was crucified as a serpent in form in order to deal with Satan, the Devil, the old serpent
It was through being crucified as the serpent that the Lord Jesus crushed the head of the old serpent, the Devil
Concerning this, John 12:31 says, 'Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out'
As the One who died as a serpent under God's judgment, the Man-Savior dealt with the Devil and with his world, the satanic system
Not only was there a partition between Jews and Gentiles; there were also partitions between every nationality and race
Hebrews 10:20 speaks of 'a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh'
After the Lord accomplished His all-inclusive death, His situation of suffering immediately changed into an honorable one
In human honor of a high standard the Lord rested on the Sabbath day, waiting for the time to resurrect from among the dead
As those who have been crucified and buried with the Lord Jesus, we have been terminated; we have been brought to a full end
The women who had come together with Him out of Galilee followed after, and beheld the tomb and how His body was placed
Writing from his viewpoint, Luke speaks in particular of the Man-Savior's walking and talking with two disciples on the way to Emmaus
If He had remained in the tomb, that would have meant that God did not justify what the Man-Savior was and what He did
Acts 2:32 says, 'This Jesus God raised up,' and Acts 3:15 speaks of the Lord as the Author of life, 'whom God raised from the dead'
Romans 4:25 says that Christ 'was delivered because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification'
The death of Christ fulfilled and satisfied God's righteous requirements so that we may be justified by God through His death
That would have affected our salvation because, in such a case, His death would not have been followed by God's vindication
We are justified by God because of Christ's death, and in Christ, the resurrected One, we are accepted before God
The Man-Savior's resurrection from the dead is a strong sign of His great success in His universal achievement
When He came forth from the tomb in resurrection, this was His victory over the world, Satan, death, Hades, and the tomb
As Peter says in Acts 2:24, 'Whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it'
He was Christ in the flesh, but He has been transfigured into the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who essentially is the life-giving Spirit
His actual transfiguration was His resurrection, for in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who imparts life into us
Just as His death was the termination of the old creation, so His resurrection was the germination of the new creation
When He was resurrected, He became corporate, a corporate Christ , the Christ who is both the Head and the Body
In chapter twenty-four of his Gospel Luke gives us a record of Christ's resurrection and, in particular, of His action in resurrection
Verse 1 says, 'Now on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared'
The Lord's resurrection had been accomplished, but the discovery of it required the disciples' seeking in love toward the Lord
According to verses 4 through 7 two men stood by them in shining clothing and said to them Why are you seeking the living One among the dead
And behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village named Emmaus, sixty stadia away from Jerusalem
Luke 24:15 and 16 say, 'And it came about as they were talking and discussing, that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them
In 24:17 the Man-Savior said to the two disciples, 'What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking?
They said to Him The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene who became a Man a Prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people
In the Scriptures there is a full record, a complete revelation, concerning Christ and His death and resurrection
Because these matters were not opened up to the Lord's followers, He came to them in order to open the holy Word to them
As they were reclining at the table, the Man-Savior 'took the loaf and blessed it, and having broken it, He handed it to them
Not only did the eyes of these two disciples need to be opened; the eyes of Peter, John, and James also needed to be opened
In this message we shall continue to consider the resurrection of the Man-Savior, and then we shall go on to consider His ascension
We have seen that the case of the Lord's appearing to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus is helpful and practical for our experience
Luke 24:36 and 37 say, 'And as they were speaking these things, He Himself stood in their midst and said to them, Peace to you!
And while they still did not believe for joy and were marveling, He said to them, Do you have anything to eat here?
Just as the Man-Savior had opened the Scriptures to the disciples on the way to Emmaus, He now opened the Word to those gathered in the room
The Law of Moses, the Prophets, and Psalms are the three sections of the entire Old Testament, that is, all the Scriptures
The Savior's word here unveils that the entire Old Testament was a revelation of Him and that He was its center and content
In chapter one of Acts Peter could stand up among the one hundred and twenty and interpret the Scriptures in the right way
The Man-Savior's meeting with the disciples in Luke 24 was the right time for Him to commission them to preach the forgiveness of sins
The Lord Jesus seemed to be telling the disciples, 'You have been brought into My resurrection and into the jubilee
According to the following books of the New Testament, the forgiveness of sins ushers the forgiven ones into the riches of the Triune God
To proclaim forgiveness of sins requires economically the Spirit of power received through the baptism in the Spirit
They were to wait in Jerusalem until the Lord poured out upon them the promise of the Father, which was the promise of the economical Spirit
The Spirit in John 20:22 is the Spirit expected in John 7:39 and promised in John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-8, 13
The Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter
By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself as life and everything to them essentially
The former as the water of life requires our drinking ; the latter as the water for baptism requires our being immersed
What took place in John 20 was a matter of life essentially, but what happened in Acts 2 was a matter of power for ministry economically
For this reason, some Bible teachers have called the Spirit of power the 'mantle Spirit,' the Spirit as an outer coat
We also need to realize that the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power are two aspects of the one Spirit for our experience
On the one hand, we have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body; on the other hand, we have all been given to drink of the one Spirit
The inward aspect of the Spirit is for life essentially, and the outward aspect is for ministry and work economically
The disciples were excited and returned to Jerusalem with great joy , waiting to be equipped with the Holy Spirit economically
His death was by the God-man to accomplish God's redemption for man and to release Himself into man as the fire of life to burn on the earth
Ephesians 1:22 tells us that God 'subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be the Head over all things to the church'
In resurrection we receive the essential Spirit for life, and in ascension we enjoy the economical Spirit for power
We have covered these matters in a brief way in certain of the foregoing messages, but we have not covered them adequately
We need to be impressed with the fact that the incarnation of Christ is closely related to the purpose of God in creating man
If we have an all-inclusive view of the revelation in the holy Word, we shall see that in eternity past God designed man to be one with Him
Some Bible teachers say that in Genesis 1 image refers to something inward, and likeness, to something outward
In the Life-study of Genesis we pointed out that man was created in the image of God inwardly and after the likeness of God outwardly
In that Life-study we said, 'Man was created not only in the image of God inwardly, but also after the likeness of God outwardly
We may say that in Genesis 1:26 and 27 image refers to the inward being and likeness to the outward expression
The image is the inward reality of the outward expression, and the likeness is the expression, or the outward appearance, of the image
Man was created in God's image and after God's likeness in order to be God's duplication that he may express God
God's purpose was to make man His duplication for His expression so that man may actually and fully be one with God
1 John 5:11 and 12 say, 'And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son
Finally the book of Revelation speaks clearly of the tree of life with which the entire city of New Jerusalem will be nourished in eternity
Even though we are fallen, we still have in our fallen condition love, light, and the capacity to be right and to be holy like God
For God to create man in His own image means that God created man with the capacity to have His love, light, righteousness, and holiness
God created man in His own image in such a way that man has the capacity to contain God's love, light, righteousness, and holiness
Human love, light, righteousness, and holiness are created capacities to contain the divine love, light, righteousness, and holiness
Even an unsaved person may have the sense that it would be unrighteous to keep extra change given to him by mistake in a restaurant or store
Man has these virtues because he was created in God's image, in the image of God's love, light, righteousness, and holiness
God created man in this way with the intention that man would take Him as the tree of life to be his life and content
Because Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of the tree of life, he spoiled God's design
As we shall see in the following message, the Man-Savior's incarnation fulfilled God's purpose in the creation of man
In this message we shall continue to consider the Man-Savior's incarnation fulfilling the purpose of God's creation of man
In order for this purpose to be carried out, it is necessary for man to receive God and contain Him as the tree of life
God had created man with a purpose according to His design, but man failed Him in His purpose and destroyed His design
The Man-Savior as the second Man was not created; rather, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a human virgin
He was conceived of the Holy Spirit in order to have the essence of God and He was born of a human virgin in order to have the human essence
A crucial matter concerning the God-man is that He lived a human life filled with the divine life as its content
The divine nature with its attributes was expressed in the Man-Savior's human nature with all the human virtues
Because the Lord lived in this way, His love was the human virtue of love filled with the divine attribute of love
His love was not merely human it was a human love filled with the divine love and also strengthened uplifted and enriched by the divine love
The Lord's living was a matter of the human virtues filled, strengthened, uplifted, and enriched by the divine attributes
In the Gospel of Luke we see a life filled with human virtues that are strengthened, uplifted, and enriched by divine attributes
As the Godman was living in such an uplifted humanity all those around Him including His disciples were living in a fallen damaged humanity
In chapters one and two of Acts we see that the disciples had another kind of humanity, an uplifted and restored humanity
Not only had they been saved, but their humanity had been restored, recovered, through the Spirit's regeneration and transformation
Adam should have lived in the garden of Eden the kind of life Peter and John lived in the first chapters of Acts
We have seen in the two foregoing messages that the Man-Savior's incarnation was for the fulfilling of God's purpose in creating man
According to the Bible, what God is is revealed mainly in four aspects: love, light, righteousness, and holiness
The Man-Savior was conceived of God with the divine attributes for the content and reality of His human virtues
Christ was conceived of God with His attributes to be the content and reality of the 'glove' of His human virtues
The reason the human virtues are not empty with Jesus Christ the ManSavior is that His human virtues are filled with the divine attributes
When He became flesh, He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but did not have the nature of the flesh of sin
When Christ became flesh, He had only the appearance of the flesh of sin; He did not have the nature of sinful flesh
Because what was conceived in Mary was of the Holy Spirit, what was born of this conception was a 'holy thing,' something intrinsically holy
Not only was the Lord's conception and birth a mystery, His human living for thirty-three and a half years was a mystery as well
The divine attributes fill, strengthen, enrich, and sanctify the human virtues for the purpose of expressing God in the human virtues
According to the four Gospels, whatever the Lord Jesus did in His life on earth was the expression of God in His human virtues
With Him the divine attributes filled the human virtues, and the human virtues contained the divine attributes
In the ManSavior the divine attributes and human virtues are one that is the divine attributes and human virtues are mingled together as one
With the Man-Savior the divine attributes are in the human virtues, and the human virtues contain the divine attributes
We have also seen that the Man-Savior was born of the human essence with the human virtues created by God for man
The Man-Savior was born of the human essence with the human virtues in order to rescue these virtues from man's fall
The Man-Savior was born of the human essence with the human virtues also to restore and recover man's virtues from the damage of man's fall
A brother may love his wife very much one day, and the next day he may be unhappy with her and even think of divorcing her
A girl may be very loving toward her mother at one moment, but this love is easily broken and may suddenly change
Of course, the Man-Savior Himself had such a surpassing righteousness, and this righteousness is the highest standard of morality
Paul was endeavoring to be found in Christ not with his own righteousness, a human righteousness, but having the righteousness of God
He lived a life with the human virtues filled, strengthened, enriched, and sanctified by the divine attributes
Rather, when He saves us, He comes into us as the One with the human virtues filled with the divine attributes
Suppose a person could actually be saved according to the natural concept of merely being rescued from hell and brought to heaven
Now as the life-giving Spirit He enters into us to bring God into our being and to fill our virtues with God's attributes
In the Gospel of Luke there are a number of cases illustrating that the ManSaviors standard of morality qualifies Him for dynamic salvation
Because of the Man-Savior's dynamic salvation, Zaccheus became another person immediately after coming into contact with Him
His humanity in the highest standard of morality was the 'wire' conveying the 'electricity' of the Spirit with the eternal life
The Spirit with the eternal life as the divine electricity was within the Lord's humanity of the highest standard
The Man-Savior's dynamic saving power is constituted of His highest standard of morality in which His powerful Spirit and eternal life are
We have been considering a living Person, the God-man with the highest standard of morality as His saving power
Even though He was a royal descendant of the family of David He was born into a poor family and lived among the lower class for thirty years
Have you ever wondered why there is such a gap between the accomplishment of redemption and the application of redemption?
Why did He not become a man, stay on earth for a short period of time, perhaps a month, and then go to the cross to accomplish redemption?
Luke 2:40 says, 'And the little child grew and became strong, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him'
Of simply telling that the Lord Jesus was born and that He died for our redemption and was resurrected, Matthew records many other matters
In the Gospels we see that the Man-Savior did not grow up miraculously; on the contrary, He grew up in a normal way
Why, then, did He need to suffer during His first three hours on the cross, since that suffering was not for our sins?
Rather, for our salvation the saving God became a man and lived the kind of life on earth that qualified Him to save us
In the second step, the Man-Savior comes into the saved ones, lives in us, and grows in us, repeating His life in us
Not only does the Lord grow gradually in the believers; He has also been spreading gradually throughout the world
At first, His spread was only in the area of the Mediterranean Sea, and eventually He spread to North America and to China
The term 'salvation in life' has been damaged by some Bible teachers who actually do not know adequately what it means to be saved in life
The Man-Savior went through a long process not to save us by snatching us out of hell, but to carry out His dynamic salvation
When He became twelve years old, He went with His parents to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover according to custom
According to the Old Testament, a Levite had to be thirty years of age before he could enter fully into the priesthood
We have used the illustration of a hand and a glove to show how God was expressed through the Man-Savior's humanity
Concerning the expression of God in the Lord Jesus, John says, 'We beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father'
For the next three and a half years they saw the God-man's living, although they did not understand what they were seeing
After the Man-Savior's resurrection, their eyes were opened, and they began to understand the Man-Savior's God-man living
When He was with them in the flesh, they did not understand that the Lord was a man living a human life to express God
In a forthcoming message we shall see that God's desire is to reproduce in us the Man-Savior and His God-man living
In order to be qualified to be man's Savior, the Lord Jesus had to be a genuine man with a real human nature and the perfect human virtues
Because He is genuine as a man, real in His human nature, and perfect in His human virtues, He is qualified to be the Man-Savior
On the one hand, they teach that Christ is the complete God; on the other hand, they teach that Christ is only part of the Trinity
His human virtues are perfect, but His divine attributes are excellent; His attributes are superior, surpassing
In particular, it is the result of a ten-year Life-study of the New Testament, a study that will soon be completed with the book of Acts
The Bible as a whole certainly reveals that the Lord's divinity empowers His saving capacity, which is in His humanity
John 1:7 conveys the thought that the divinity of Christ empowers and ensures the saving capacity within His humanity
According to 1 John 1:7, the blood shed by the Man-Savior on the cross was not only the blood of Jesus but also the blood of the Son of God
As the God-man the Lord Jesus has the divine nature with its divine attributes to be His content and reality for the expression of God
The God-man is both the 'glove' and the 'hand,' for He has both humanity as the container and divinity as the content
In this mingling there is not the producing of a third nature, a nature that is neither fully human nor completely divine
In John 6:38 He goes on to say, 'I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me'
The mind, however, represents our being only in thought; the will represents our being, or our soul, in its doings
The point we are making here is that our mind represents our being in thought, and our will represents our being in action, in deeds
The love expressed was not simply the Samaritan's human love; it was a human love strengthened, empowered, and enriched by the divine love
The Lord Jesus lived a genuine human life, yet in His life we see the divine element and also certain divine factors
Just as the fingers of a glove contain the real fingers, so the Man-Savior's mind, will, and emotion contain God's life
In the ManSaviors Godman living mans virtues became a shell an image to express Gods attributes so that God may be expressed in mans living
If He had lived on earth only a short time, there would have been only a momentary expression of the divine attributes in His living
As we shall see in the next message, this prototype is for the 'mass production,' the reproduction, of the God-man in the believers
In a similar way, the Man-Savior's God-man living constituted Him a prototype so that He may now be reproduced in us
The answer to this question is that the Man-Savior became a life-giving Spirit with a wonderful, all-inclusive qualification
For thirtythree and a half years He lived the life of a Godman that is He lived a human life by the divine life for the expression of God
Paul does not speak of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of God, but of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Christ is the God-anointed Jesus passing through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection
If we compare John 3:6 with John 3:14 and 15, we shall see that the Spirit here is the extract of Jesus Christ
Since God has poured out His Spirit, what people need to do in order to be saved is to call on the name of the Lord
When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we call on the name of the dear, all-inclusive One, the One who is above all
From experience we know that when we believe in Jesus and call on His name, the Spirit comes as the all-inclusive Person to be our life
In order for the Lord Jesus to come into us as the life-giving Spirit, it was necessary for Him to go through a lengthy process
As such an extract, this Spirit comprises the divine element with the divine attributes and the human element with all the human virtues
After calling to the Lord for help this one may expect the Lord to stretch forth His hand from the heavens and help him
Some Christians actually do not believe that Christ lives in us; they believe that He is merely on the throne in the third heaven
If you consider your experience you will realize that when you call on the Lords name something moves within you and even mingles with you
If we pray in this way, we may expect the Lord's help to come from the third heaven and may feel that we need to wait for His help to arrive
We experience this because the One who moves in us and mingles with us is the life-giving Spirit as the extract of the all-inclusive Christ
The Lord does not rescue us from our temper by doing something miraculously as the ascended One on the throne in the heavens
Just as taking medicine is not superstitious, so experiencing the moving of the Spirit in us is not superstitious
On the day we called on the name of the dear, all-inclusive One, the all-inclusive Spirit came into us, and we were born of Him
The first step in the reproduction of the God-man is that we be reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit with His divine life and nature
Concerning this, Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3:17 and 18, 'The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
The Spirit in John 3:6 is for regeneration, and the Lord the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3:18 is for transformation
It is rather easy to understand the meaning of regeneration, but it is not easy to understand the meaning of transformation
The more we call on the name of the Lord, the more He moves within us to cause a metabolic change that affects our intrinsic being
Praise the Lord that we have been regenerated once for all and that we are now in the process of being transformed!
The Spirit of Jesus is mainly for the Lord's humanity and human living; the Spirit of Christ is mainly for the Lord's resurrection
To experience the power of the Lord's resurrection, as mentioned in Philippians 3:10, we need the Spirit of Christ
The only thing we need to do is to obey God as the One who operates in us the willing and the working for His good pleasure
Perhaps you have experienced a considerable change in life, but you still need to be saved from your murmurings and reasonings
By the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ we are saved inwardly from our murmurings and reasonings
He aspired to have his whole being immersed in Christ and saturated with Christ so that all His believers would discover him fully in Christ
A condition for being found in Christ is that we have Christ as our subjective righteousness, as our surpassing righteousness
In Philippians 310 Paul said To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings being conformed to His death
The mold of Christ's death refers to His continual putting to death of His human life so that He might live by the life of God
We need to be reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit, and then we need to be gradually transformed by the pneumatic Christ in our soul
We shall also be found in Christ with Him as our surpassing righteousness, in the power of His resurrection, and conformed to His death
On the Sabbath day in the synagogue at Nazareth, He read from the book of Isaiah and proclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord
Those who study politics know that if someone is to rule others, the first thing he must do is take care of feeding them
Some claim that Roosevelt was great not merely in political affairs but in uplifting the living standard of the American people
The political leaders who are respected most by the people are those who have the ability to improve the level of daily life
In these countries a person may earn a great deal of money, but much of it must be given to the government in taxes
Although God is very different from worldly politicians and has not taught man any 'isms,' we may say that He is a 'great statesman'
One may live in the wilderness for a long time without a house, but he could not live very long without eating
In Leviticus 25 we are told not that the land was returned to its original owner, but that the person returned to the land
Eventually, it was not the land that was returned to the seller; it was the seller that returned to the land, to his possession
We see that the principle of balancing the amount of land among the people was written in the Bible thirty-five centuries ago
From Leviticus 25 we see that it was possible for an Israelite to sell his possession and thereby lose his portion of the land
The proclamation of the jubilee was a proclamation of the release of people's possessions and of the people themselves
Those who had lost their land could return to it, and those who had sold themselves could go back to their families
Like unbelievers, they have lost God as their possession, and they have sold themselves to sin, pleasures, and worldly amusements
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, the entire human race had lost God as their possession and had sold themselves into the slavery of sin
According to the four Gospels, not even those in the Jewish land, the so-called holy land, had God as their possession
According to Leviticus 25:9, the jubilee was sounded on the day of atonement, which was on the tenth day of the seventh month
It was necessary for the trumpet of the jubilee to be sounded on the day of atonement because the jubilee is based on redemption
In typology, the day, or time, of redemption was signified by the day of atonement on the tenth day of the seventh month
To hallow the fiftieth year is to sanctify that year, and to proclaim liberty throughout the land is to proclaim release
We see that this liberty, this release, involves the returning of every man to his possession and of every man to his family
Contrary to our natural concept, the trumpet of the jubilee was not sounded on the first day of the first month of the fiftieth year
When applied to our spiritual experience, this indicates that the preaching of the gospel comes first and the jubilee follows
Many of us can testify that in our experience of salvation we heard the preaching of the gospel long before we were saved
If we read carefully Leviticus 25:8-10, we shall see that the sounding of the trumpet always took place before the year of jubilee
Beginning with the first month of the year, the fiftieth year was hallowed, sanctified, as the year of jubilee
These are cases of saints who entered into the jubilee at the time they first heard the gospel and learned of the Lord Jesus
Most Christians had a time of preparation first and experienced the jubilee sometime after they first heard the gospel
Some time later we received God's salvation at a time that was hallowed, sanctified, and we entered into the jubilee
If we would understand the definition of the jubilee, we need to see that the jubilee means the proclaiming of release and freedom
Concerning this, Leviticus 25:13 says, 'In the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession'
The year of jubilee was a proclamation not only of the release of sold land but also of the freedom of one who had sold himself into slavery
In a similar way, in our experience during the past seven sabbaths of years, we sold our possessions and even ourselves
In Paul's words 'If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new'
The word about not sowing, reaping, or gathering signifies that we should not labor on Christ in a natural way or by our natural strength
In any religion people are encouraged to exercise their effort to behave themselves, to improve, and to do good
Of laboring in a natural way by our own sowing, reaping, and gathering, we should simply enjoy the riches of Christ
It was a year of proclaiming freedom to all people, and it was a time of freedom, rest, enjoyment, and satisfaction
In this message we shall go on from the definition of the jubilee covered in the two previous messages to the blessings of the jubilee
In our gospel preaching, we need to trumpet the jubilee; we need to proclaim the return to the lost possession and the release from bondage
In the foregoing messages we pointed out that although we are men created by God, we have lost God as our real possession
In the jubilee it is not that our possession is returned to us; rather, we are returned to the possession which we left
He then 'went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed hogs
His intention was to tell his father that since he was no longer worthy of being a son, he would like to labor as a hired one
According to the type in Leviticus 25, during the year of jubilee there was to be no sowing, reaping, or harvesting
After the prodigal son was returned, he, the father, and those in the household began to enjoy the inheritance
Genesis 1:26 says that man was made in the image of God, and Romans 9 reveals that man was created to be a vessel
For a vessel to be without content, to be without its possession, is to be empty, and to be empty is to be poor
In Psalm 90:1 we see that God is also our dwelling place: 'Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations'
We may be able to live without adequate clothing and transportation, but we cannot live without food and lodging
In the year of jubilee the concern was not with clothing or transportation; instead, the concern was with eating and housing
According to the Gospel of John, we should eat the Lord and also dwell in Him, for He is our food and our lodging
Certain Christians who are not knowledgeable in the Scriptures may be troubled when they hear about eating Christ
A proclamation concerning the jubilee may be made, but if your stomach is empty, you will not care for that proclamation
When we come to Leviticus 25 in the Life-study Messages, we shall see that the main thing in the experience of the jubilee is eating
Of eating of the tree of life, Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and thereby became fallen
Ephesians 2:12, a verse that describes the actual condition of fallen mankind, says that man is now 'without God in the world'
The same thing is declared in Leviticus 25:13: 'In the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession'
The divine inheritance here is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people
In the type of the jubilee in Leviticus 25:8-13 one of the main blessings was the return of every man to his own inheritance
In the fulfillment of the jubilee here in Acts 26:18, receiving the divine inheritance is also the primary blessing
We can testify to you that as soon as you believe in the Lord Jesus and enter into Him, you will be brought back to God as your possession'
We all are like the prodigal son, who came back to the father and to his family and could then enjoy his portion, his inheritance
The second blessing of the jubilee is that those who have sold themselves as slaves are freed from their slavery
If he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, both he, and his children with him'
In the fiftieth year, in the year of jubilee, the one who had sold himself as a slave was freed from his slavery
We may say that the seven sabbaths of years in verse 8, the seven times seven years, are also seven 'weeks' of years
The jubilee did not come at the end of a single week of years, but after a course of seven weeks of seven years
The year after seven weeks of seven years was, of course, the fiftieth year, the first year of the eighth week of seven years
The principle of the jubilee being on the fiftieth year is the same as that of the day of Pentecost being on the fiftieth day
The day of Pentecost was on the seventh eighth day, just as the year of jubilee was on the seventh eighth year
After seven courses of days came the day of Pentecost, and after seven courses of years came the year of jubilee
On the other hand, there is also a good point to being saved after passing through a number of lengthy courses in human life
For years, as indicated by the seven weeks of years before the year of jubilee, he may have tried to redeem himself, but without success
A person who is saved early in life, perhaps at the age of twelve, may not have much realization of the significance of the jubilee
To him, it may make little difference whether or not there is a jubilee, because he has not passed through many courses in life
My point here is that when a person is saved later in life, he has a greater enjoyment of the jubilee than one who is saved as a child
Since he has not passed through even one or two courses in human life, he cannot have much appreciation of the jubilee
Those who are saved at an early age have the opportunity to learn more of the Bible and to experience and enjoy more of the Lord
When such a person hears the sounding of the jubilee, he will not have any joy, because the jubilee does not mean anything to him
Someone who is saved as a very young child cannot testify of the jubilee as did the brother who was once an opium smoker
We have seen that the two main blessings of the jubilee are being returned to our possession and being released from slavery
We shall realize that the jubilee proclaimed by the ManSavior in chapter four of Luke is a principle that governs all the following chapters
To proclaim this is to sound the trumpet of the jubilee, to announce the jubilee of God's New Testament economy
Of fulfilling God's purpose, the man created by God was seduced by God's enemy and carried away from God's purpose
Even many Christians who are clear about man's fall do not have an adequate understanding of the issue, or the result, of the fall
Those who are married have problems, but those who are not married may have just as many problems, if not more
As far as problems and sufferings are concerned, it is difficult to say whether it is better to be married or unmarried
Because believers are eager to learn how to have a happy married life, books on marriage are popular in Christian book stores
Surely any married person, knowing the problems of married life, would like to know how to have a happy marriage
According to his understanding, the lack of riches was an important factor in his living to the age of one hundred
The president or head of a country must bear a very heavy burden, a burden much greater than that borne by an ordinary person
Anyone who is not in good health should not seek a high political office because the pressure on him will be great
The real significance of suffering is twofold: to suffer is to have no rest, and to suffer is to have no enjoyment
If we do not have enjoyment, we do not have satisfaction; and if we do not have satisfaction, we do not have rest
Suffering in married life may be caused even by the issue of whether the bedroom window should be open or closed
Those who are educated and cultured and those who are uneducated and uncultured are all going downward to hell
In all nations, when a holiday comes, people cease from work and have a time of rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment
It is unique in history that a people numbering more than two million spent forty years without industry or farming
After coming into the wilderness, the children of Israel should have done nothing except praise the Lord, enjoy Him, and rest with Him
Concerning God being our portion, Psalm 16:5 says, 'The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup'
According to Leviticus 25:10, in the year of jubilee a person could be returned to his own possession and to his own family
The Passover had brought them into a condition and state where they could possess God as their good land for their rest and enjoyment
In the year of jubilee the people could be returned to their possession and to their family in order to have rest satisfaction and enjoyment
As we shall see more fully in the following message, this type is a picture of what the Christian life should be
The Christian life is a life of liberty, freedom, and release, a life full of rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment
We pointed out in the foregoing message that this is a life of resting in the good land and of enjoying the riches of the good land
Our Christian life should be a life full of liberty, freedom, and release, a life full of rest, satisfaction, and enjoyment
The result of the prodigal son's coming back to his father's house was that he and all those in the house could eat, drink, and be merry
The riches of Christ are what He is to us, such as light, life, righteousness, and holiness, for our experience and enjoyment
Only a small minority of Christians daily are enjoying the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit
The first kind of labor is the labor to be a good person, to have good behavior, and to improve one's character
No one can be saved by the works of trying to improve ones behavior and character to keep the law and to be good patient kind and honest
In the Life-study of Philippians we gave a number of messages entitled 'A Life Full of Forbearance but without Anxiety'
To say that we shall not have suffering when we enjoy the Lord does not mean that our environment will improve
When John sent two of his disciples to ask the Lord to do something for him, He indicated that He would not do anything
If we feel that in a particular environment we are suffering, this indicates that we still love certain things other than God
If we feel that it would be a suffering to lose our parents, children, wife, or husband, this means that we do not love God solely
If we love God solely giving our love entirely to Him having nothing to divide our love we shall not be bothered by whatever happens to us
How would you feel if none of your children were an apostle, elder, deacon, or deaconess, or if none of them were in a respected profession?
We all should do our job; however, we should not labor in the sense of struggling to be good, worrying, dreaming, and suffering
If in our hearts there is no ground for anything or anyone other than God, He will always be our enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest
It is very difficult for us to give all the ground in our being to God because we are fallen and have a fallen nature
We have the labor of struggling to improve ourselves, the labor of anxiety, the labor of dreaming, and the labor of suffering
We shall enjoy God in Christ as the good land flowing with milk and honey, and we shall have enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest
Of struggle, anxiety, dreams, and suffering, we shall have the all-inclusive processed Triune God as our enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest
In the foregoing messages we have considered in detail two very important matters: the incarnation of the Man-Savior and the jubilee
Now in this Life-study we want to cover two more vital matters-the Man-Savior's resurrection and His ascension
It is also difficult to find a writing that covers all the various matters we shall see regarding the Lord's resurrection and ascension
All that we have seen concerning Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension comes from diligent study of the Word under the divine light
When we consider the Man-Savior's resurrection, we need to humble ourselves and empty ourselves of preoccupying thoughts
By resurrection God vindicated and approved the Man-Savior; God also vindicated and approved the Lord's redemptive work
According to the four Gospels, there was much criticism, especially from the Jewish leaders, of Christ's Person and deeds
Concerning His Person some said that He was a Samaritan that He was beside Himself that is mentally ill and that He was demon possessed
The religious leaders regarded the Man-Savior as worse than a criminal and a murderer, as someone worse than Barabbas
Other verses in Acts that speak of God raising up Jesus from among the dead are 5:30; 10:40; 13:30, 33-34, 37; 17:31 and 26:8
The reason this is repeated so often is that the entire book of Acts is a book of the testimony of the resurrection of Christ
In resurrecting the Lord Jesus, God seemed to be saying to the Jewish nation with its leaders, 'I approve what you condemn
Romans 4:25 says that Christ 'was delivered because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification'
The death of Christ fully satisfied God's righteous requirements so that we may be justified by God through Christ's death
His resurrection is a proof that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God because of His death
A wealthy friend of yours intervenes to pay the debt for you, and then gives you the receipt as proof of payment
We have seen that the Lord's resurrection was God's vindication and approval of the Man-Savior and His all-inclusive redemptive work
When the Lord Jesus appeared to the disciples as recorded in Luke 24, He said to them, 'Do you have anything to eat here?
Timothy 1:10 says that Christ 'nullified death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel'
Christ nullified death, making it of none effect, through His Devil-destroying death and death-swallowing resurrection
In the gospel the revelation is brought to us that Christ has nullified death and has brought us eternal, indestructible life
Christ's resurrection was not only God's vindication and the Lord's success, but also His victory over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave
Because this matter is difficult to understand and define, it is helpful to use the illustration of a grain of wheat
According to His own word in John 12:24, the Lord Jesus was a grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died
When the shell of the Lord's humanity was broken on the cross, the divine life within Him was released in resurrection
He prayed for this glorification in John 17:1: 'Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You'
No longer was He merely God, for through incarnation He had become the God-man, having both divinity and humanity
According to the New Testament revelation, when the Lord Jesus rose up from the dead, He rose up with both His divinity and His humanity
Not only was the Son of God glorified by being released from within the shell of the Lord's humanity, but the man Jesus was also glorified
While on the way to Emmaus He said to the disciples Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory
Have you ever heard a message telling you that your Savior was glorified when His humanity was brought into divinity?
In resurrection the Lord came to His brothers, who composed His church, and declared the Father's name to them
It is important for us to realize that, before incarnation, God's only begotten Son did not have human nature, only the divine nature
His resurrection was the release of the divine life and nature, and through this release He was begotten as the firstborn Son of God
We thank the Lord for showing us all the points related to the objective aspect of the Man-Savior's resurrection
Christ's resurrection as His transfiguration is a difficult matter to explain, for this involves the Divine Trinity
According to this teaching which is very superficial and far from being accurate when the Son came as a man He left the Father on the throne
When the Son was on earth, He was not alone, for the Father was always with Him: 'I am not alone, because the Father is with Me'
In the Gospel of John we see that the Son was sent 'from with' the Father, that is, not only from the Father but also with the Father
In John 6:46 the Lord Jesus said, 'Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father'
When the Son was on earth, the Father was not only with Him but also in Him, even as the Son was in the Father
We should abandon the thought that only the Son came to earth leaving the Father and the Spirit in the heavens
What we teach concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is based on the pure word of the Bible, and the Bible cannot be defeated
He said that He would ask the Father to give them another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, who would be in them
If He were not a Comforter, then He would not have said that He would ask the Father to send another Comforter
If we read verses 16 through 20 carefully, we shall see that, eventually, the second Comforter is actually the first Comforter as the Spirit
You have just said that You would ask the Father to send another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, who would be in us
Because He is triune, three-one, we should not think that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit can be separated
We should not think that when the Spirit came He came alone, leaving the Son and the Father on the throne in heaven
His resurrection was His transfiguration-the transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit to enter into His believers
All these elements were brought into the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit who became the consummation of the Triune God
Just as the incarnation added humanity to God, so the Man-Savior's resurrection brought all these elements into the life-giving Spirit
The point here is that the Lord lived a life under death to Himself and that this kind of living is related to the process of resurrection
Now we need to see that the resurrection of a grain of wheat does not begin when the wheat sprouts out from the soil
The point we are making here is that the resurrection of a grain of wheat does not begin with the sprouting of the grain
From the illustration of the dying and growing of a grain of wheat we can see that while Christ was dying, He was resurrecting
According to the picture of a grain of wheat dying and growing, Christ's resurrection began while He was dying
He likened Himself to a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die so that many grains might be brought forth
The Lord did not say that He is the life and the resurrection; He said first that He is the resurrection and then that He is the life
The Lord's life on earth for thirty-three and a half years was a life of dying to live, a life of living by dying
Eventually, His death was completed on the cross, and His resurrection was completed on the third day after His crucifixion
The unbelievers only have the process of dying, but we have both dying and living, both death and resurrection
Resurrection was a process of transfiguration in which these elements were put into the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
Now we can understand why Romans 10:8 says that the word is not far from us but is very near, even in our mouth and in our heart
The Man-Savior's resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit, and as this Spirit He now dwells in us
We have seen that the Man-Savior's resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into His believers
In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus says that if a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it bears much fruit
As he calls on the name of the Lord Jesus, the divine life is imparted to him, and he is germinated to become a new creation
We are a new creation , not according to the old nature of flesh, but according to the new nature of the divine life
The divine life was 'injected' into us at the time we believed in Christ and were regenerated, and that injection was our germination
As an illustration of the Lord's propagation through resurrection, consider a grain of wheat that falls into the earth and dies
The many grains are the multiplication of the one grain, and this multiplication is the propagation of that grain of wheat
According to John 12:24, the Lord Jesus is the grain of wheat who fell into the ground and died in order to be multiplied
The relative pronoun 'which' at the beginning of verse 20 refers to 'the surpassing greatness of His power' spoken of in verse 19
God's right hand, where Christ has been seated by the surpassing great power of God, is the most honorable place, with the supreme authority
The ascended Christ has been seated by the great power of God above all rules, authorities, powers, and lordships in the entire universe
Ephesians 1:22 continues, 'And He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church'
The former is a matter of Christ's transcendency; the latter is a matter of the subjection of all things to Him
The result, the outcome, of these four matters is the church, as indicated by the phrase 'to the church' in verse 22
Very few believers have seen that the church comes out of what the surpassing great power of God has done in and with Christ
According to the New Testament, the church that is recognized by God is the issue of four things done with Christ
The church is the outcome of the process involving these four things, a process that began with the Man-Savior's resurrection
Because this process began with Christ's resurrection, His resurrection is for the producing of the church as His reproduction
Today the Man-Savior in His resurrection is the life-giving Spirit to make us, God's chosen people, His reproduction
The Body is not an organization but an organism constituted of all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the Head
Some Bible teachers oppose this truth, claiming that the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is not the Holy Spirit
Praise the Lord for His transfiguration, germination, and propagation to produce the church as His reproduction!
In the foregoing messages we have covered both the objective and the subjective aspects of the Man-Savior's resurrection
The result of the Man-Savior's transfiguration, germination, and propagation is that He lives in His believers
When Christ as the life-giving Spirit entered into us, we were germinated with the Triune God to become the new creation
In John 20 after the breathing of the lifegiving Spirit as the breath into the disciples there were at least one hundred twentyone Christs
The one Christ first became one hundred twenty-one Christs, and then three thousand one hundred twenty-one Christs
No doubt, this One is the Son, but this is the Son in whom the Father is, and also the Son who is coming with the Spirit
If the Lord had remained in the tomb, He would not have lived, and the disciples would not have seen Him again
In answer to the question concerning whether we have seen the Lord, we should say, 'I have seen the Lord because He lives in me'
The pneumatic Christ is actually the life-giving Spirit Himself, not in a doctrinal way but in an experiential way
Throughout the centuries, a number of Christian teachers have said that in our experience Christ is identical to the Spirit
Doctrinally this is difficult to explain; however, experientially we know that Christ is the Spirit living in us
The best answer to this question is to say that the One who lives in us is the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit
Many believers do not realize that this living Christ is the Christ in resurrection and the Christ who is resurrection
We cannot know Christ without knowing the power of His resurrection, because the very Christ we live today is resurrection
When we walk by the life-giving Spirit, we walk with the living Christ, and this living Christ is the Christ in resurrection
If we would understand the Man-Savior's ascension, we need to see that it is His inauguration into His heavenly office
It is, of course, correct to say that this word is not in the Scriptures, but the fact of the Man-Savior's inauguration is there nonetheless
The expression 'the Triune God' likewise is not in the Bible, but it is a fact that the Bible reveals the Triune God
Some theologians would agree that Christ is God, man, and the Creator, but would deny the fact that He is also a creature
Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, indicating that with respect to His humanity He is a creature
Some theologians say that Christ is both God and man, and then say that He is only the Creator, not a creature
He is the Redeemer and the life-giving Spirit, and this life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God'
Hebrews 29 says But we see Jesus who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor
Another matter related to the objective aspect of Christ's ascension is that He has been enthroned for God's administration
Revelation 22:1 speaks of 'a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb'
Revelation 22:3 goes on to say of the holy city, New Jerusalem, that the 'throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it'
Revelation 22:1 and 3 do not speak of thrones-one for God and another for the Lamb-but of the throne of God and of the Lamb
The Man-Savior, as the ascended One, has been crowned with glory and honor and has been enthroned for God's administration
He is now the Lord to possess the whole universe, God's chosen people, and all positive things, matters, and persons
In answering such a question we need to realize that the very Christ in resurrection, the pneumatic Christ, lives in us
According to Mark 16, Luke 24, and Acts 1, the Lord ascended to the heavens so that something further could take place
After breathing Himself into the disciples, it was still necessary for Him to be inaugurated into His heavenly office
Now the very Christ who lives in us and works through us is not only the One in resurrection but also the One in ascension
We need to see that, as believers, we have One living in us who has not only life and power in resurrection but also authority in ascension
We may not have much appreciation for what is revealed in the Scriptures concerning the Man-Savior's resurrection and ascension
We need to be impressed with the fact that the Lord's relationship with us does not stop with His resurrection, but goes on to His ascension
He has been inaugurated into His heavenly office to administrate the entire universe and to execute God's New Testament economy
It always makes a difference in contacting others when we know their status, qualifications, position, and office
They do not have much understanding of the process through which He passed in order to be inaugurated into His heavenly office
Concerning this John 13 says All things came into being through Him and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being
After His wonderful resurrection and in resurrection, He ascended to the highest place in the universe; He ascended to the heavens
When we contact Him, we need to have the realization of what He is, a realization of His status, position, and office
In His mercy He has broken through the 'ice' and opened the depths of the Scriptures to show us all these treasures
Some of them do not feel good that we use some new expressions, expressions not used by others in teaching the truths of the Bible
By the Lord's grace, we can and should improve or adjust the discoveries of the deeper truths conveyed in the Holy Word
Triune God' and 'Trinity' were new expressions used by the early teachers of the biblical truths to denote the triune Godhead
Some deeper aspects of the truth concerning Gods New Testament economy which the Lord has shown us in recent years require new expressions
It is not likely that as recently as twenty or twenty-five years ago this word was often used in Christian writings
Our use of the expression 'God's economy' is just one illustration of the fact that the Lord's recovery is going on
It is not as easy to speak of the subjective aspect of the Man-Savior's ascension as it is to speak of the objective aspect
We have seen that in His ascension Christ was crowned with glory and honor and enthroned for God's administration
Through His ascension Christ was also inaugurated to be the Lord to possess all and to be the Christ to carry out God's commission
Since all these matters are objective, how can we prove that Christ's ascension is related to us in a subjective way?
The second part of Ephesians 1:22-'and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church'-has been a problem for translators of the Bible
It does not mean that God gave Christ to the church as a gift; it means that God gave Christ a gift-the headship over all things
According to this understanding, a great gift was given to Christ by God, and this great gift was the headship over all things
Ephesians 1:19 says that the transmission of God's power toward us is 'according to the operation of the might of His strength'
As used in verse 19, the phrase 'according to' also indicates a model or pattern, showing us how this great power is transmitted to us
Paul, seemingly exhausting the vocabulary of the Greek language, speaks of power, operation, might, and strength
God's power is transmitted to us according to an operation, and this operation is of the might of His strength
The three steps of raising Christ, seating Him in the heavens, and subjecting all things under His feet are great steps
According to the second way of translating the verse, these great steps are followed by a lesser step-giving Christ to the church
The third way of translating Ephesians 1:22 says that God gave, appointed, or made Christ the Head over all things for the church
God raised Christ from among the dead seated Him in the heavens subjected all things under His feet and eventually gave Him a great gift
Vincent says that the word 'gave' in verse 22 does not mean appointed or made; instead, it means to give something as a gift
God came in to raise Him up to seat Him in the heavens to subject all things under His feet and to give Him to be the Head over all things
The best translation of the second part of Ephesians 1:22 is: 'gave Him to be Head over all things to the church'
We need to see that the phrase 'to the church' indicates that all that Christ is in His ascension is being transmitted to the church
Electricity may be installed in a building once for all, but the transmission of electricity takes place continually
God raised up Christ seated Him in the heavens put everything under His feet and gave Him the great gift of being the Head over all things
Through the divine transmission from the ascended Christ to the church, the Man-Savior's ascension is definitely related to us
As long as we are clean receptacles and are willing to open ourselves, this transmission will take place continually
Now whatever He has attained and obtained in these four steps taken by God concerning Him is being transmitted into the church
Praise the Lord for the transmission into our being of the Christ who is both in resurrection and in ascension!
Concerning the experience of the divine transmission, we have all been hindered by the distorted teachings of traditional theology
The economy, or dispensation, which God purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times
Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth
We need to know that for God's heading up of all things, this unique Head needs a Body, and this Body is the church
At that time all divisions and separations will be removed, and all things, not only mankind, will be headed up in Christ
Although the heading up of all things in Christ and through the church is far beyond our understanding, it is nonetheless a fact
When some hear about the eventual heading up of all things in Christ through the church, His Body, they may ask when this will take place
Now we shall go on to see that the ascended Christ is the Head of the church and also the High Priest in the heavens
Just as in ones physical body the head and the body are one so Christ the Head and the church His Body are joined and therefore are one
To those who hold this concept it seems that there is a vast distance between the Head in the heavens and the Body on earth
How can we say that the Head is in the heavens and that the church, the Body, is on earth, far away from the Head?
According to the Bible, the Head is not alone in the heavens without His Body, and the Body is not on earth without the Head
For Christ to be the Head of the church, His Body, is certainly not a material thing; this is altogether a divine matter
We have often pointed out that this fullness is the result, the issue, of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ
Hebrews 4:14 says that we have a 'great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God'
Hebrews 726 says For such a High Priest befits us holy guileless undefiled separated from sinners and become higher than the heavens
In His ascension Christ passed through the heavens now He is not only in heaven but is also higher than the heavens far above all heavens
It is significant that in the book of Revelation Christ is unveiled first not as the Administrator, but as the Priest
Revelation 1:13 says, 'In the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet'
In Revelation 1:13 Christ is depicted as the High Priest, as shown by His garment, a garment reaching to the feet, that is, a priestly robe
The first vision of Christ in Revelation, recorded in chapter one, is that of the High Priest clothed with a priestly garment
As the High Priest, Christ is walking among the lampstands and taking care of them, especially of their shining by trimming the lamps
He is a 'merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God' , a High Priest who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses
Although Christ as the High Priest is taking care of us, we all have our own thought and feeling as to how He should care for us
As the High Priest in the heavens, the Lord is the surety and Mediator of the better covenant and the Executor of the New Testament
Every blessing in the New Testament is a bequest applied to us by the living, resurrected, and ascended Christ
