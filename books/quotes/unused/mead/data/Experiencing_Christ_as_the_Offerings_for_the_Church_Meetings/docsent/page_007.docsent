   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A HAPPY TIME TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You have to realize this plantation was the gathering and the habitation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During those days of the feasts, all the children of Israel stayed there on the mountain day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If their feast lasted seven days, they stayed on the mountain seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When God looked upon Mount Zion and saw all His chosen and redeemed people staying there, He was so happy!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That gathering was God s dwelling place on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All His chosen and redeemed people stayed with Him on that mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That was a plantation, that was a gathering, and that was a habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And that was a mutual home to God and to His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE FULFILLMENT OF THE TYPE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was a picture in the Old Testament, and today our meetings are the fulfillment of that type.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the past we have had two slogans: Christ is our life, and the church is our living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to change the word church to the word meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is my life, and the meeting is my living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Don t you realize that all the people today on this earth are miserable?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether they are dancing, or surfing, or playing ball, or eating, or drinking, or gambling, or stealing, they are miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether they are strong or weak, they are miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether they are well or sick, they are miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How about us?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Are we also miserable?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you don t come to the meeting, are you miserable or pleasant?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I can testify that I am happy every day in my home, but often I am not that happy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But I am guaranteed to be happy when I come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In my fifty years in the church life I cannot remember a meeting in which I was miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I was miserable sometimes in my home, but I don t remember even once being miserable in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE MOST PLEASANT PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why are we so pleasant in the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes I have had the feeling that the meeting was too long.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Recently our Lord s table meeting lasted two hours and forty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was really tired out by sitting there for one hundred and sixty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But I must tell you that I was not miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was tired out, yet I was still pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In a sense I wanted to go home, yet in another sense I wanted to stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I was hesitating to go back home.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as I am in the meeting I know I will be pleasant, but when I get back home I might be miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do have the assurance and the guarantee that I will be pleasant as long as I am in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to spend some time to re-study our meeting life so that we could see something more.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a sense I am not encouraging you to come to the meeting, but I would like to tell you what is the difference between coming to the meeting or not coming to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have a choice, life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is up to you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you like to die, you just remain there at home.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you like to live, come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Outside the meeting you are about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if you come to the meeting you are guaranteed to live.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is pleasant here.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From my experience I can say that the most pleasant place on earth is the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes due to your subjective personal problems you brought your miserable situation from your home to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You shouldn t blame the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You should blame your foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes I brought my miserable situation right to the front door of the meeting hall, but then I said, Don t follow me! go away!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then I came into the meeting without my miserable situation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to the human life, the unique pleasant time and the unique pleasant place is the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some might say that the most happy time and the most happy place was their wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It might be.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But even if it was really a happy time and place, that was only once for your whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we can experience the meeting time and the meeting place again and again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Comparatively speaking the most pleasant place and the most pleasant time is our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The unbelievers don t have this kind of meeting so they have never tasted such a pleasant place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But we have!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you were to ask me according to my human life experience what is the most pleasant time and what is the most pleasant place, I would say it is the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I love America, but I must tell you the truth that if there were no meeting, the U.S.A. would not be a pleasant place.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What could I do here?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Watch TV?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That would be disgusting!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Listen to the music?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>That would be terrible!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to believe in the Lord Jesus that He will lead and guide us into His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>That is the meeting.</S>
