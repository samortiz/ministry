The chauffeur said, "If you open the door and jump out, hell will be right there. But you should remember that if you do not believe in God, you will not be there, because there is no one in hell who does not believe in God!" Everyone in hell believes in God. James 2:19 says, "You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe and shudder."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BOOK OF THE HEART</H2><P>A near-illiterate person once read the "Holy Bible" as the "Heart Bible." The Bible becomes the Book of the Heart. This is probably what the ancient psalmist meant when he said in Psalm 119:111, "Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HEART OF THE PREACHERS</H2><P>One Monday morning, two preachers met each other on the road. One said, "Last night I spoke on `The coming of the Judgment Day.'" The other said, "I wish you would say this with tears." Indeed this is true. Acts 20:19 says, "Serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHERE ONE CANNOT FIND CHRISTIANS</H2><P>One young man could not stand the zeal of his parents toward God. He could not bear the spiritual atmosphere at home, and he thought that there were too many Christians in his own town. He was tired of their presence and tired of their heavenly talk, and he set about to escape to a lake by train. On the train, he saw two old people opposite his seat with their Bibles open, discussing spiritual matters. He was angry at seeing so many Christians. At the next station, he left the train to give vent to his anger. There he saw a few old women talking to each other. When he approached them, he realized that they were also talking about the Lord Jesus. There was a lake in that place, and many people went on the lake. He took a steamboat to travel to the other side of the lake. On the boat, again he heard many people talking about heavenly things. They were all Christians! He found out later that they all belonged to a tour group from a Christian school. This made him very agitated. Later he went on deck and asked the captain of the boat angrily, "Where can I go to avoid these accursed Christians?" The captain was not a good man either. He answered sharply, "The only place is hell." This word pierced the young man's heart deeply. Soon after this, he became a Christian.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FINAL PRAYER</H2><P>The bishop of England was a faithful worker of the Lord. He labored day and night. On his deathbed he prayed, "Lord, forgive me for my sin of negligence!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IMMEDIATE EFFECT</H2><P>The Keswick Convention in England is the top among all spiritual conferences in the world. It has been preaching sanctification, consecration, and victory for over half a century. Dr. Meyer, who has been to China before, was conducting one of these convention meetings. At the beginning of the meetings, he told the congregation, "If you have any overdue debts at home, you cannot expect to have God's blessings this time." The next day, the money orders at the post office were all sold out.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LOCK BEING ON THIS SIDE</H2><P>Once a man met a preacher on the streets of London. He said to the preacher, "When I was in Paris, I heard your preaching, and I can still remember it. At that time, I heard the message and repented and believed in God." The preacher asked what he had heard. The man said, "You said that `the lock is on our side.' I had always thought that God was cruel and that I had to do good before I could please Him. When I heard your word, I had a fresh realization, and I knew that the Lord Jesus was waiting for me to receive Him. If the Lord Jesus is not in my heart, the fault is with me." John 5:40 says, "Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life."</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5) &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
