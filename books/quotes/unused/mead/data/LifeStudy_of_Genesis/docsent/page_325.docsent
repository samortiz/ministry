   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a Lot's Wife</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have already pointed out, there is no doubt that Lot's wife was saved from destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is so definitely and clearly revealed that no one can argue with it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But, as we have seen, she looked back from behind her husband and became a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That she walked behind her husband indicates that she was even less willing than her husband to leave Sodom and that she was not happy to follow him out of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If she had been happy to flee Sodom, she would have walked side by side with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even before she looked back and became a pillar of salt, she was already behind her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At this point, let me say a word to the wives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In committing sin, it is good for a wife to be reluctant to follow her husband, but concerning the things of God, it is not good for her to be slow in following him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning the things of God, the best thing for a wife to do is to go along with and walk together with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Wives, in the things with God, do not go behind your husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you do, you, like Lot's wife, may suffer and become a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a warning to us all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That Lot's wife became a pillar of salt signifies that she had lost her function and had become a sign of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When salt is in the form of powder, it is very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more that salt is ground into fine powder, the better it functions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But no one uses salt in the form of a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus said that we, the saved and regenerated ones, are the salt of the earth Matt 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our function is to kill the germs of this corrupted world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if we become tasteless Luke 14:34 , it means that we, like Lot's wife, have lost our function.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As one of the people of God, Lot's wife should have been filled with the salty taste and been able to kill the germs of corruption around her, but she lost her taste and became functionless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She was a sign of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In writing the book of Genesis, the Spirit of God was unwilling to give the name of Lot's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although the name of Abraham's wife, Sarah, is mentioned many times, there is no mention of the name of Lot's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is unworthy of mention.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That poor saint walked behind her husband and looked back toward the city of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She might have looked back for her children, her house, and her other belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All her goods were left there in Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Her interests, heart, desire, and soul were still there, though her body had been pulled out of that city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, at her looking back to that place, the Lord caused her to become a pillar of salt as a warning example to us all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Luke 17, the Lord used Lot's wife as a warning example for His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, not many Christians today live under this warning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, we must heed the warning that a truly saved person faces the possibility of being put to shame at the Lord's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I certainly do not want to become a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To become a pillar of salt is not a glory; it is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a shame for a believer to become a lifeless pillar of salt standing in the open air for nothing but suffering!</S>
