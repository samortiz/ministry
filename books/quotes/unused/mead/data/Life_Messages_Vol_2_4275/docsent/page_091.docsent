   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEMANDS OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Religion, culture, and morality all make demands.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They tell you what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To ask "What should I do?" is to partake of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To partake of the tree of life is to eat and drink without asking any questions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The marriage vows are a case in point.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The bridegroom promises to love his wife unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The bride, in turn, vows to obey her husband, never turning back.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The pastor exhorts them to be true to their vows, as the Scripture teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do these exhortations and vows belong to the tree of life or to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Demands that are put upon you are from the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who instruct you in how to behave are eating from that tree.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you are invited to a feast, you go there to eat, not to keep regulations!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's only desire is that you eat of the tree of life, not do this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible ends with one call and one promise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let him who hears also say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let him who is thirsty also come; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely" Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The call is to come and drink of the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The promise is in verse 14: "Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those whose robes are washed in the blood of the Lamb may come to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After I was saved, I came to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I began to pursue Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I wanted to be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What I had to work on the hardest was my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nothing bothered me so much as my quick temper.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Though I dearly loved my mother, when my temper got the upper hand I would say things to her that I would afterwards deeply regret.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because of my longing to overcome my temper, I bought a good number of books on the subject of how to overcome or the way to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I first read them, they seemed to make sense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I tried to put them into practice, however, I found they did not give much real help.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only later did I come to realize that books of that type only teach their readers to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE SUPPLY OF THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What does the Bible teach?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus said, "I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He who eats Me shall also live because of Me" John 10:10; 6:48, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He did not come as a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not come as a pastor, to give you scriptural advice about how to get along with your spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He came as bread for you to eat!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eat Him!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not ask Him what you should do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But this is a hard word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You cannot take in the matter of eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You want to learn how to deal with your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What method should you use?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What would be the proper psychology?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To use your mind to work out your problems is to eat of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The tree of life does not need to be analyzed and understood; it is simply to be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many Christians admire the eloquence of their pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They enjoy his weekly sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes he talks of heaven; other times, of earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He talks about the future and about the past.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His audience finds his words stimulating, inspiring, and challenging.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They think they are receiving sound guidance for their daily path.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Alas!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are feasting on the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord wants to be eaten, but we refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we read the Bible or hear a preacher, we pay attention and try to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The tree of life, however, is for eating, not for understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In John 6 the Lord calls Himself the true bread out of heaven v. 32 ; the bread of God who gives life to the world v. 33 ; the bread of life v. 35 ; and the living bread v. 51 . He is to be eaten!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We long to have advice.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Formerly, I would easily give suggestions when various ones came to me with problems.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What I was really doing was teaching them to eat of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now, if you check with any young people who have come to me for help, they will all tell you I had no advice to give them except to eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Nonetheless, you still want to know what to do, what course you should follow, what method you should use.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You are probably thinking, "Yes, it is all very well to eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But when my husband loses his temper with me next time, how shall I handle the situation?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What method will alleviate matters?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How shall I react?"</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When you ask questions like that, you turn back to the tree of knowledge.</S>
