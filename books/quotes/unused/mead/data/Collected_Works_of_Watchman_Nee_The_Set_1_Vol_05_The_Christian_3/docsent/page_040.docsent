   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ's characteristics should be the characteristics of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ said: "Thy word have I hid in mine heart" Psa 119:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the character of the faithful ones in the latter days.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul told Timothy, "But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For men...having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power...But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse" 2 Tim 3:1, 2, 5, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet, there is a proper way for God's remnant to take.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"But you, continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned them and that from a babe you have known the sacred writings" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When all around in the world is changing, only the Bible, God's Word, can preserve us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we draw near and keep God's written word, we will be kept safe in perilous times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Old Testament which Timothy studied when he was a babe plus the New Testament which he had "learned" from the apostle are our guide today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not a great manifestation of power or the performance of miracles that will preserve us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The most important thing is God's written word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord did not say that they have power.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, He said that they have kept His word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"My word."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has called us to keep Christ's own word and to draw near to Christ Himself rather than to the word of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we accept the word of the church, it means that the church has the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if we accept the word of Christ, it means that Christ Himself has the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should judge everything by the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even the church should be judged by this word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the time of the failure of the church, the Lord has not charged us to listen to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have seen how in Thyatira the words of Jezebel were considered inspired and authoritative.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have also seen in Sardis how this self-claim and self-boasting has been rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, although the church was not inspired, she was still teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man now says that we already have an open Bible, and we praise the Lord that this indeed is the case.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result of this, it is right that there should be much shining of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But what about the creeds?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Protestant creeds pay much attention to the fundamental doctrines of the gospel, but even this is man's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever they may say, they originate from man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of course, at the beginning, these creeds were what those who drafted them believed in. Later, through difference of opinions, different creeds were established.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After this, the dispute concerning the creeds increased.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At this point, there are divisions upon divisions, sects upon sects.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It has become a great shame to Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, on the one hand, the Protestant churches today no longer consider themselves the unique "catholic" church like the Roman Catholic Church does.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, on the other hand, the different Protestant creeds show that Protestantism is for sectarianism.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To set up any creed outside the Bible, no matter how scriptural it may be, is to build up a wall and to shut out those with different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"If you are not one with us, please go away to set up another sect."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the church of God will not accept all regenerated persons, but will add some creeds to the Bible, it is a sect already.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank God that He has called us to keep the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, the simple children will be lost in the present confusion of creeds, organizations, and names.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What we should keep is His word and not the church's word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everyone who would keep Christ's word should not be bound by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His conscience can only be responsible to one master.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He should follow the Lord as if he were the only Christian on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One's knowledge of God and His word and one's walk according to His word should be gradually increased.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the present age of apostasy, the most important thing is to take care of keeping God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word of Christ brings us closer to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It will preserve us and will separate us from the deception of the end time and will cause us to walk contrary to it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The characteristic of the present time is impostoring.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse" 2 Tim 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"These things I have written to you concerning those who lead you astray" 1 John 2:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What we see at the present time are but impostorings and the leading astray of people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Soon, the unique Antichrist will surely appear.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, "even now many antichrists have come" 1 John 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, we must not "believe" in them Matt 24:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those who "did not receive the love of the truth" will be deceived by "all power and signs and wonders of a lie" 2 Thes 2:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, we must hold fast the truth of the Bible so that we will not be deceived by those who come as impostors of messengers of light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The only guarantee is the keeping of the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a personal matter, because deception comes in privately.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once we are not watchful, we will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The power of deception is like that which the serpent used to deceive Eve; there is always the danger of our being corrupted from the purity which is toward Christ 2 Cor 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What can save us from this danger?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not the outward display of power in the form of miracles and works of wonders.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These things are, on the contrary, mostly instruments of deception.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We cannot deal with Satan with miracles and works of wonders, for we are weak to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our security lies in our personal adherence to the Bible of Christ and in our not denying His name.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"Kept My word."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How much this word encompasses!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This word includes the form as well as the detail of the Lord's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The believers in Philadelphia were not keeping a line here and a line there.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They did not give it up when the price became too great.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Rather, they kept it "through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report" 2 Cor 6:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If our motive is not to obey in everything, we will obey in nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord will not compromise with us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He will not allow us to obey Him in some things and disobey Him in other things.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Unless He is Lord of all, He is Lord of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should understand what it means to keep the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If there is any significance to the word "keep," it should at least mean an absolute obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should obey what we consider to be less significant just as absolutely as what we consider to be more significant.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should not consider any of the Lord's commandments as too small but should obey the "smallest" in the same way that we obey the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is to keep the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is often a test to our motive.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Are we willing to follow the Lord in the dark, instead of being in doubt, and to go out by His leading, not knowing where we will be going?</S>
