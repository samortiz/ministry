   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING THE CHOICE PORTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE UNIQUE PLACE BY RELEASING OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Christ by whom we live and with whom we live becomes our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We eat Him and we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not eat our sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I eat my Christ and bring the top portion of the Christ I have experienced to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I bring this Christ to the meetings, share Him with others, and offer Him to God, I enjoy Him with God and with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Firstly, I came to recognize my need of the top portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then I began to help the saints to realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, this revolutionized our living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From then on we learned how to have the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Secondly, I learned how to bring the top portion of the harvest to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the beginning, however, I did not realize the need to release my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, I shared Christ in a rather dead way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I related my experience of Christ to the saints in a deadening way without the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I realized what I was doing, I condemned myself and repented.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After that, I came into the meeting and said, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I don t need patience, endurance, or brokenness!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I need Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And the best way to gain Him is to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How refreshing this is!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Remember the three things necessary for eating the choice portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, we must have the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This harvest is not a harvest of patience, endurance, lessons, suffering, or bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need a harvest of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Day by day, we are not growing patience; we are growing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to live by Christ and with Christ, giving Him the opportunity to grow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we shall have a harvest of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second, we must discern what is the unique place of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must not go to a place of division, a place where there is neither the Lord s presence nor His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, when we come to the place of unity with our harvest of Christ, we must function by releasing our spirit to share Christ with others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we do all this, the meetings of the church will be filled with the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is in this way that we enjoy the top portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This enjoyment of Christ makes us strong and solid for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It will cause us to become a mountain out of which come the iron and brass needed to defeat the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah, this is God s economy!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>IDOLATRY AND THE DEPARTING OF GOD S GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Old Testament times the kingdom was established, and the glory of God came down and filled the temple 1 Kings 8:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, this glorious situation did not last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The children of Israel became degraded, and idols were placed in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ezekiel 8:9-16 reveals that the temple was filled with idols and that the elders even took the lead to worship idols.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the New Testament, the church established at Pentecost was full of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, not too long afterward, the so-called church became full of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today idolatry abounds in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you enter a Catholic cathedral, you will see idols all along the walls.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the book The Two Babylons, many heathen things were brought into Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Take the example of Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>December twenty-fifth, the day Christmas is celebrated, was originally the birthday of the pagan sun god.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After Constantine the Great embraced Christianity, he encouraged others to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As a result, thousands of unsaved persons were baptized into Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Formerly they worshipped the sun and celebrated the birth of the sun on December twenty-fifth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After they were baptized into Christianity, they maintained their heathen practice of worshipping the sun, and eventually this practice was absorbed by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They changed the name of the sun god to Jesus and claimed that December twenty-fifth was the birthday of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What an insult to the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What blasphemy!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Easter also has a pagan origin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, the Catholic Church worships Mary, calling her the mother of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Actually, the Mary in Catholicism is a heathen goddess.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This heathen goddess was brought into Catholicism, and her name was changed to Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now she is called the mother of God, and Catholics worship her.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And it is abominable in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A number of aspects of paganism have been brought into Protestantism through Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christmas is celebrated not only by Catholics, but by those in all the major denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This indicates that these denominations are involved in paganism.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Ezekiel 10:18 says, Then the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Due to the idolatry in the temple, the glory of the Lord departed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the temple was built, the glory of God filled it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But in Ezekiel chapter ten, because of the idols the glory of God departed and returned to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This whole picture signifies first that on the day of Pentecost the glory of God came down and filled the church built up by the Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Later, due to idolatry and paganism, the glory of God left the so-called church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today the glory of God is not in the Catholic Church nor in any group involved with paganism.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This involvement is blasphemy to God and an insult to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How can God dwell in such a place?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is impossible!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The reason today s Christianity is so pitiful is that God is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Catholicism, Protestantism, and all other groups involved with paganism are Babylonian in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Catholic Church, the mother of the prostitutes, is the great prostitute, and all the other Babylonian groups are her daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is not my teaching; it is God s word in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christianity may have the name of God, but the glory of God is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is impossible for Him to dwell in a place filled with idolatry and paganism.</S>
