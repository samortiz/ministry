   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>13 Concerning Joseph a A Son of a Fruitful Tree by a Fountain</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 49:22 says, "A son of a fruitful tree is Joseph, a son of a fruitful tree by a fountain; whose branches run over the wall" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Firstly, Joseph is a son of a fruitful tree.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This son is, of course, the bough of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If Joseph is the bough, the son, then the fruitful tree must be Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the record of the Bible, no one prior to Jacob had twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Twelve is the number of eternal completion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fact that Jacob had twelve sons means that he was very fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jacob was the son of Isaac, and Isaac was the son of Abraham, the father of the called race.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible God is called the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob Exo 3:6; Matt 22:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This title is also the title of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The God of Abraham refers to God the Father, the God of Isaac refers to God the Son, and the God of Jacob refers to God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we have pointed out, we should not consider Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as three persons, but as three aspects of one person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In like manner, the three of the Triune God are three in one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Jacob signifies the coming of the Spirit, the third of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Father was in the Son, and the Son became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the Spirit is the issue of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we touch the spirit of the Bible, we shall see that, as a fruitful person, Jacob signifies the producing God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is the fruitful tree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is proved by the fifteenth chapter of John, where Christ says that He is the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ as the embodiment of God is the producing tree.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ truly is fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here in Genesis 49 we see a son of this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Son of God is the branching out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason, in the Old Testament Christ is called the Branch Jer 23:5; Zech 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible is deep, profound, and far beyond our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, the Bible says that Christ is a tree and, on the other hand, it says that He is the branch.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is He then the tree or the branch?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is both.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the embodiment of God, He is the tree, but as the branching out of God, He is the branch.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Joseph, a type of Christ, was also the son of a fruitful tree, the branching out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Joseph was God's branching out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we all know, the branch of a tree is part of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, Joseph, the son of Jacob, was part of Jacob, the fruitful father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Speaking typically, Joseph was Christ as the Son of God who was the branching out of the fruitful God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 22 says that Joseph is a son of a fruitful tree by a fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fountain is God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The tree is God; the fountain is also God; everything is God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jacob, a type of the fruitful tree, lived by God as the fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A tree requires water.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If it has water, it will grow fruitfully.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jacob realized that all his fruitfulness came from God as the fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here we are told that Joseph, as the son of Jacob, branches out all the riches of this tree that come from the fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>b His Branches Running over the Wall</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The son, the bough, of this fruitful tree has branches that run over the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Chapter forty-nine is filled with figurative speech.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 22 we have a garden, a wall, and a tree inside the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The bough of this tree has many branches, and these branches run over the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to the figure, this means that Jacob was moving out beyond the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was not limited to the good land, but he ran out over the wall to Egypt, spreading beyond the limits of the good land into another region.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today, Christ as the very Joseph within us is spreading over the restricting wall.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The wall cannot restrict Joseph's spreading; it cannot limit the branching out of this bough.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have this Joseph within us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that we have Christ within us as today's Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our Joseph has many branches which are running over the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These branches run over all limitations, for example, the limitations of family, school, or the restrictions of the opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No matter how high the wall may be, Joseph's branches will run over it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No matter how high the opposing wall may be, the very Christ within us will run over the wall by means of the many branches.</S>
