 <h2 class="head1">BRINGING THE NEW WAY TO A LOCAL CHURCH</h2>
<p>We may have seen something of the new way, but to carry out what we have seen is not an easy thing. This is true even with all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We must first try our best to avoid any kind of unification. Do not try to unify all the churches with what is presented in these chapters. To unify is a big mistake. To unify will not help us to carry out God&rsquo;s ordained way. Rather, to unify would frustrate this way. Perhaps your local church has not come up to the level of the practice of this God-ordained way. There may be many reasons and factors for this. You must not look down on the church. Do not consider that because you have seen these matters, you have a special knowledge that the saints in your church do not have. To have this concept is altogether wrong. Do not think that you are extraordinary or superior. Although the church in your locality may not yet be able to come up to the level of what you have seen, you must go along with the church one hundred percent. Even if the church still has the Sunday morning message meetings, you should still attend these meetings.</p>
<p>Many churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have a time in the meetings for sharing from the saints. After the Lord&rsquo;s table and quite often in the prayer meeting there is a time for sharing. You should consider this as the golden portion of the meeting. That is the time for you to share, to exercise your spirit to function in a refreshing way. Many saints in the meeting need the refreshment. Take the opportunity to speak in the sharing time, but do not do too much. If the sharing section of the meeting is twenty minutes, you should occupy three minutes at the most. To occupy more time may offend people. Do not expect to do a quick work. You must carry this out little by little, week after week. Perhaps after fifty-two weeks you will have accomplished something. Simply take the opportunity to share, not only livingly and richly, but also refreshingly. Let all who hear your sharing feel so refreshed. They will aspire to do the same thing that you do. This will cause the church in your locality to rise up to the point that they can carry out the new way. You do not need to propose anything. Simply go along with the church.</p>
<p>Perhaps the church in your locality still does not practice the preaching of the gospel by knocking on doors. However, probably the church would not prevent you from knocking on doors. Even if some dear ones are opposed to the door-knocking, none of them would say anything to frustrate gospel preaching. Do not argue, and do not label yourself as a trained door-knocker. This will offend people. Go out to preach the gospel in an ordinary way. Do not even use the term &ldquo;door-knocking.&rdquo; Simply say that you are going to visit your relatives, classmates, or friends for the preaching of the gospel. The church will not prevent you from doing this, and the elders will not criticize you for doing this. They will be happy with you. When you baptize someone, you may bring them to the meeting. On the other hand, you may not feel to bring them to the meeting right away. You may have weekly or biweekly home meetings with them for a short while to lay a good foundation with them. Through this they will taste the new way. Then if you bring them to the meeting, they will not be influenced by the way of one person speaking. In Taipei, even though certain new ones came to the big meetings, they had no taste for the old way because of the foundation laid with them.</p>
<p>You should not criticize anything or express an opinion. Do not stand in the meetings of the church to tell the saints that their practice is not right or up to the proper standard. Simply go along with the church, do your duty, and exercise your spirit, faith, and wisdom with much grace. When you do everything in the right way, the Lord&rsquo;s grace will be with you. People will sense that there is much grace with whatever you do. The saints will receive a bountiful supply from you. Expressing your idea or opinion, despising others, and criticizing or even uplifting a church will not help others. Only the exercise of your spirit with faith, wisdom, and grace can nourish and cherish people and even bring them into God&rsquo;s economy. If you exercise in this way, you will be a good steward of the grace of God (1 Pet. 4:10). Eventually, all the churches will be brought up to the standard of the new way.</p>
<p>Do not have the intention of speaking too much concerning this way to the church in your locality. Do not even promote or push the practice of pray-reading two verses in the morning. Sometimes we may push something to such an extent that we impose it on others. This will offend people and stir up opposition. Rather, after a meeting go to a brother&rsquo;s home for a little fellowship. After five or ten minutes according to the Spirit&rsquo;s leading, you may ask the brother to pray-read two or three verses with you. Do not use any special terminology or tell him that this is a &ldquo;propagation group.&rdquo; Simply pray-read with this dear one. He will be nourished and cherished and will receive the benefit. You do not need to charge this brother to continue to pray-read. He will spontaneously do it. After you are gone, he may tell his wife about pray-reading and try it with her. Do not propose, push, or impose anything. Simply live and practice the new way.</p>
