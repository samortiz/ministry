   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO A LIFE FULLY ACCORDING TO AND FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 1 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:1, 9-11, 14-15; 9:2-9; 16:14-20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With this message we begin a series of supplementary messages to the Life-study of the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These messages will be concerned with the life of the Slave-Savior as a life that is fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Gospel of Mark we see a Person, the God-man, who lived a life that was fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we would understand this life, we need to know what God s New Testament economy is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, it takes the entire New Testament to explain the life the Lord Jesus lived.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that it takes all the other twenty-six books of the New Testament to define the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we make a thorough study of the New Testament with respect to God s economy, we shall see that there is no defect, deficiency, or shortcoming in the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The life He lived was absolutely according to and for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In His life there is nothing contrary to this economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although we may love the Gospel of John and the Gospel of Matthew, in these Gospels we do not have a complete biography of the Lord s life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This complete biography, presented in its historical sequence, is found in Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this Gospel we have a complete record of a life, the life of the Lord Jesus, that is according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this life there is no deficiency with respect to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mark is the base of Matthew, John, and even Luke, because Mark is a biography of the life of the Lord Jesus arranged according to historical sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we want to understand a certain matter in the other Gospels, we need to come back to the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At this point I would like to call your attention to the chart printed with this message.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this chart we can see how in the Gospel of Mark the record of the Lord s life progresses step by step until we come to the highlight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we are brought into the Lord s all-inclusive death and wonderful resurrection so that we may enjoy Him as our replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The result of taking Christ as our replacement is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The new man is the reality of the kingdom of God, which issues first in the church, then in the millennium, and ultimately in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the Gospel of Mark is short, it is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It contains all the factors of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These factors are elements of the life of the Slave-Savior, a life fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>LIVING IN A NEW DISPENSATION</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the One who lived according to and for God s New Testament economy, the Lord Jesus lived in a new dispensation, having the old dispensation terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is clearly revealed and portrayed in chapter one 1:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John the Baptist was born a typical Old Testament priest, yet he lived in the wilderness in a way that was uncultured.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His appearance and his food were very different from that of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John s work and his way of speaking were also uncultured.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever a person repented, John put that one into the water, baptizing him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All this was an indication that the old dispensation had been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was the situation and atmosphere when the Lord Jesus began His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that His ministry was fully in the New Testament dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, with His life we cannot find anything of the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>HAVING HIMSELF BURIED</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord Jesus was about to begin His ministry, He had Himself buried, baptized, by John the Baptist 1:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He had no sin or oldness, yet He was still baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His baptism was a testimony to the universe that He rejected Himself, that He put Himself aside in order to live by God.</S>
