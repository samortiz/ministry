   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT WHAT IS GAINED THROUGH REGENERATION THE NECESSITY OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are two reasons that man must be regenerated: one reason relates to a higher purpose, and the other to a lower.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The lower purpose is that our human life is wicked and corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It cannot be changed or improved; consequently, we need another life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The higher purpose is that even if our human life were good, it still would be related merely to the created life rather than to the uncreated life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to have the uncreated life of God, we must be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although this may not be considered a profound truth, it is a basic and simple truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must be regenerated because we do not have the life of God; only by regeneration can we have the uncreated, eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must have the eternal life of God because it is God s intention to make us the same as He is with His image and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to make us the same as He is, God must put His life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If He did not put His life in us, how could we be like Him?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to be like Him, we must have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to have His life, we must be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the higher purpose of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE MEANING OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regeneration means to be born again, to be born of God, that is, to obtain the life of God in addition to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God puts His life in us in addition to our human life, this is called regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the meaning of regeneration is to be born again of God; to be regenerated is to obtain the life of God in addition to our original human life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our apprehension of this spiritual truth must be clear, and when we speak of regeneration, we must make this point.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE RESULTS OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are three results of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, regeneration causes us to become the children of God; second, it makes us the new creation; and third, it causes us to be in union with God, to be joined to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THAT WHICH IS GAINED</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THROUGH REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regeneration also causes us to gain seven things: the life of God, the law of life, a new heart, a new spirit, the Spirit, Christ, and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through regeneration, we receive the life of God, and the law of life comes with this life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then God gives us a new heart and a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we receive the Spirit, we receive Christ and God because God is in Christ, and Christ has become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we are regenerated, the life of God enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this life there is a law the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moreover, when the life of God enters into us, it adjusts our heart so that it becomes a new heart and adjusts our spirit so that it becomes a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His Spirit indwells us and causes us to obtain the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since the Spirit is the realization of Christ, and God is in Christ, we also obtain Christ and God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This clearly shows what we gain through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Life of God The Life of God Being the Content of God,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Which Is God Himself</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regeneration causes us to have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In regeneration the main thing that the Spirit of God does is to put the life of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The life of God is the content of God, that is, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All that is in God and all that God is are in the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the fullness of the Godhead, every facet of God, is included in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All That God Is and Does Being in His Life</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The essence of every living thing is contained in its life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All its inward capabilities and functions issue from its life, and all its outward activities and expressions also originate from its life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This shows that there is a capability, a function, with life, and out from this life there is an activity, an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A living is a reflection of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One s being is determined by its life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is an evident principle with every living thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God has the highest life; everything that He is, is in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is truth, holiness, light, and love; these are not things that He does.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Truth, holiness, light, and love are not God s work, but instead are God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is truth, holiness, light, and love; these are derived from His life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, whatever He does and expresses, whether it is goodness, righteousness, kindness, or forgiveness, is also derived from His life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Truth, holiness, light, and love are what God is in His inward nature; goodness, righteousness, kindness, and forgiveness are what God does in His outward expression.</S>
