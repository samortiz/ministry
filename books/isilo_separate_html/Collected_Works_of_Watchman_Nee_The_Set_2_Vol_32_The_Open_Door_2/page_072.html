During these three months the Lord has given me evidence of His grace in everything. This does not refer to the result of my work. (The success or failure of the work does not have much to do with me personally.) I am referring to spiritual experience. God has shown me the evil and corruption of the flesh. The flesh can only please men; it cannot please God. God is the One who searches man's inward parts. Outwardly, we may be completely separated from the world. But inwardly, we are still mixed up with it. There must at least be once when God deals with our self and the flesh in a deep way. When we see the Lord being hung on the cross, we cannot refrain from speaking from our heart, "Lord, You have paid such a high price for me! You are worthy of everything from me." After I consecrated myself unconditionally to Him, God began to show me how my way is one of loneliness and dejection. My previous experiences were something outward, but now His real work has begun. We met with the sisters in Chungking for four days. Although they initiated the meetings, God showed me my own needs. Hence, this meeting was altogether for me. During the past two weeks, under the Lord's leading, I came to preach the gospel in Jiang-Bei in Brother Wu Fuh-chu's home. His wife was recently saved. We will leave Chungking after the middle of January. We may go to Bei-Pei, or we may travel to the south. In the meeting hall at 9 Garden Road, there were gospel meetings every night from the second to the seventh of this month. There was quite an enthusiastic attendance, and the seats were all filled. The main speaker was an American by the name of Brother X. Please do not forget to pray for me, Sister Ma, and all the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</p><p>Sister Luh Tsi-tsien, January 4</p><h2 class="head2">The Work in Hong Kong and Macao</h2><p>Thank the Lord! He has been gracious to us, leading Mr. Luan, senior Mrs. Nee, and Miss Wang to conduct a conference in Macao. We received the help, and we saw God saving sinners. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth of this month, there were three consecutive days of baptisms. Altogether eighteen brothers and sisters were baptized. A good number of sisters have changed since the ten days of conference. They have truly realized that they can no longer neglect spiritual things. I left Macao with Miss Wang to come to Hong Kong on the afternoon of the nineteenth. The Lord willing, I will return to Macao in two or three weeks. Brother Liao Bo-hui wrote to Hong Kong from Lung-Men. Thank the Lord that He has kept him in safety.</p><p>Sister Ro-shen, December 22</p><h2 class="head2">Letters from Brother Faithful Luk, Singapore</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Over twenty brothers and sisters were baptized into the Lord recently in Yung-Ping and other places. May the Lord preserve them to the end, and may they obey the Lord in everything. At this moment Sister Chang Shou-jen is rendering some help to the sisters there. The correspondence address is [omitted]. The brothers in Penang are all at peace. Thank the Lord! I cannot go to Surabaya this year. Please pray about this. Can one of you sisters come to Southeast Asia? Please do not neglect us. There are many needs among the sisters. Sister Huang Yu-mei is in New Foochow; I cannot go there to join her work yet. I feel very lonely and feel that I owe much to the Lord's grace. I dearly hope that some co-workers can come and work here. Peace to you!</p><p>Brother Faithful Luk, November 18</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Tomorrow I may have to go to Penang. From there I will decide whether I will go to Sitiawan or to Thailand. There are two sisters in Thailand from Swatow who are living in Pu-Ji Island near Penang. There are 170,000 to 180,000 Chinese in that place, mostly southern Fukienese. I intend to take a trip there. Please pray for my future. Sister Ding is still resting in Singapore in the house of Dr. Hsie Wen-lung. Peace to you!</p><p>Brother Faithful Luk, December 28</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> </body></html>
