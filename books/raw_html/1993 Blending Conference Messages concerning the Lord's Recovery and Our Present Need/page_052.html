<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. As the Embodiment of God to Express God</H2><P>As the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9) to express God, Christ manifested God's attributes in His human virtues (1 Tim. 3:16). The four Gospels show us that He was a person always loving people and sympathizing with people. These are His human virtues, yet these human virtues are the expression of the divine attributes of God. Within God they are the divine attributes; but when these divine attributes were expressed through Christ, they became the human virtues of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. An Objective Denotation&#151;the Testimony<br>by the Believers with the Church<br>concerning Christ</H2><P>The objective denotation of the testimony of Jesus is the testimony by the believers with the church concerning Christ (Rev. 1:9; 12:17; 19:10a, b; 20:4). Actually this is one testimony in two sections. In the first section it was the testimony by Jesus for God. In the second section it is the testimony by us, the believers and the churches, for Christ. Jesus testified already, but His testimony did not stop. His testimony is continued by us. We are the continuation of Jesus' testimony. Jesus testified for God and we continue Him to testify for God through our testifying for Him. When we testify for Jesus, this means that we testify for God.</P><P>His testimony and our testimony actually are one. With Him it is subjective; with us testifying for Him, it is objective. These two aspects are one testimony. Jesus bore the testimony for God, and today we bear the testimony for Christ. To testify for Christ is to testify for God. These two denotations, objective and subjective, are expressed by the one phrase the testimony of Jesus. The testimony of Jesus refers to Jesus' testimony for God and our testimony for Jesus unto God. The entire book of Revelation reveals the testimony of Jesus. To testify for Jesus is to testify for God, because Jesus and God are one. Jesus is the embodiment of God. Actually, He is the very God. This indicates that in the whole universe there is only one kind of testimony. This is the testimony for God, first by Jesus and then by us.</P><P>The entire book of Revelation, like the entire Bible, is a book of testimony. The entire Bible testifies concerning God first by Christ and then by us. We are Christ's continuation. Hymns, #203 says that we are Christ's reproduction, multiplication, duplication, and continuation. A person's body is a continuation of his head. The body and the head are not two persons, but one person. Our body is the head's continuation. In the same way, Christ's Body is the continuation of Him as the Head. The Head and the Body both bear the same testimony for God. With the Head it is subjective. With the Body it is objective.</P>
