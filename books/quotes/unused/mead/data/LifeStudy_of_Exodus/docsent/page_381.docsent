   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN THE LIGHTING OF THE LAMPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE GARMENTS FOR THE PRIESTHOOD 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 27:20 28:5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With the foregoing message, we finished the life-study of the tabernacle with its outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After completing the section on the tabernacle, we would expect to come next to the priests, especially to the garments of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But chapter twenty-seven concludes with two verses on the lighting of the lamps on the lampstand in the tabernacle: And you shall command the sons of Israel that they bring you olive oil, pure, beaten, for the light, to light the lamps continually.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the tent of meeting, outside the veil which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall set them in order from evening until morning before Jehovah; it shall be a statute forever for their generations by the sons of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If these two verses were not included at the end of chapter twenty-seven, probably none of us would miss them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Years ago, I was bothered by the fact that after such a long portion concerning the tabernacle with its court, the divine record inserts these two verses related to the lighting of the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because I do not take anything in the Word for granted, I have brought this matter to the Lord and spent time with Him regarding it, seeking to find the reason for the insertion of these two verses at this very point.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why is this matter, which does not describe any aspect of the tabernacle or its furniture, included here?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why does this chapter end with a word about lighting the lamps?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A PRIESTLY SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In reading chapters twenty-seven and twenty-eight of Exodus, I have noticed that chapter twenty-eight also begins with the conjunction and.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Chapter twenty-eight is concerned with the garments for the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although these garments do not seem to have anything to do with the lighting of the lamps, chapter twenty-eight begins with the conjunction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the divine record puts these two matters together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the lengthy record concerning the tabernacle with its furniture and outer court, Moses adds a short section on lighting the lamps, and then follows with a portion on the priestly garments.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to find the reason for this sequence, especially why Moses links together the lighting of the lamps and the priestly garments.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To understand this matter, we need to realize that there were no windows in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In particular, there was no sky light, no window in the roof.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, it was impossible for light to get in. If there had been no light inside the tabernacle, the tabernacle would have been filled with darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are in the dark, we are not able to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we try to do something, we may cause damage or injure ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because there were no windows in the tabernacle, there was the need for the lighting of the lamps inside the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The activity of lighting the lamps was holy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These lamps were not in a common or ordinary place; they were the lamps in the sanctuary, in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because it was a holy task to light these lamps, the common people were not qualified to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They may have been good people and well-educated, but they were not holy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There was the need for holy persons to light the holy lamps in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus, for the lighting of the lamps there was the need of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The lighting of the lamps was a priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The priestly service involved three main items.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first was to offer the sacrifices at the altar in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the sacrifices had to be offered to God by a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A person coming to offer something to God was not able to do this himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He had to offer his sacrifice through a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, the priestly service first included the offering of the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This aspect of the priestly service was rather rough or coarse, for it involved the sacrifice of large animals.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The altar was a place of slaughter, and it was the duty of the priests to slaughter the animals and offer them to God as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The second and third items of the priestly service were the lighting of the lamps and the burning of the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These matters were fine and delicate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we have seen, the lighting of the lamps could not be done by common people, but could be done only by holy ones, by priests.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the Bible, spiritually speaking, a priest is one who has been fully possessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the New Testament sense, a priest is not only possessed by God in full, but is entirely filled and saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The priests in the Old Testament were types, shadows, of the real priests in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today we who believe in Christ are true priests.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As priests, we should be possessed by God, filled with God, and saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, a priest is a person who is absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His life and living are wholly for God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He lives and has his being for God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He does not care for anything on earth except God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, a priest is a person possessed by God, saturated with God, and living for God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He has no other interest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In every respect and in every way, his unique interest is God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because a priest is filled and saturated with God, he is a man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The lighting of the lamps in the Holy Place requires the service of this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For this reason, we emphasize the fact that the lighting of the lamps was a priestly service, a service of the priests.</S>
