   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The divine revelation in the Scriptures is progressive, unfolding and developing book by book and chapter by chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The sixty-six books of the Bible were written over a period of approximately sixteen hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During this long period, God did not speak once for all at one specific time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, He spoke to His people progressively, time after time, over a long period.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Colossians 1:25 Paul said that he was made a minister according to the economy of God to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the time of Paul, God s revelation in the Scriptures had not been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, there was the need for Paul to take up the burden to speak and to write in order to complete the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is John s writing in the book of Revelation, however, that marks the completion of the divine revelation in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the revelation is complete, we are warned neither to add to nor to take away from the words of God s revelation Rev 22:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now that God s progressive revelation in the Scriptures has been completed, no one is permitted to add anything to it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What we need to do today is to read, study, and even search the Bible progressively book by book.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I. A COMPARISON</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Having completed the life-study of Genesis, we come now to the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Historically, Exodus is the continuation of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Experientially, however, Exodus is not a continuation of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to spiritual experience, what is portrayed in Exodus is not a continuation of the experience of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as recorded in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In our study of Genesis we pointed out that the experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are three sections of the experience of one person, one believer: the experience of being called and of living in fellowship with God by faith Abraham , the experience of enjoying the inheritance Isaac , and the experience of transformation Jacob .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Genesis we have a clear picture of the three main sections of a believer s spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the Old Testament presents such a vivid and detailed picture of spiritual experience, the Old Testament has become very precious to me, and I have come to regard it highly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Spiritual experience has not only sections, but also different sides, different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The portrait of our experience in Genesis covers just one side, one line.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Exodus we see another side, another line.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The record of experience presented in Genesis is marvelous, but it is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the completion we need another aspect, which is found in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. A Picture of Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By comparing Exodus with Genesis we can see how Exodus presents a side or line of spiritual experience not found in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, in Genesis we do not have a clear picture of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With Abraham we see God s calling, but there is no account of Abraham s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Abraham was an example of a typical called one; he was called by God out of Chaldea, out of the land of Babel, a land of rebellion and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Abraham was still living in Babel, the God of glory appeared to him and called him Acts 7:2, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But there is no clear word concerning redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The picture we see in all of Isaac s experience is a picture of the enjoyment of the rich inheritance rather than a picture of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Neither is there a picture of redemption in the record of Jacob s experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although Jacob was eventually transformed into an Israel, a prince of God, there is no record regarding Jacob s experience of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Where then were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob redeemed?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were redeemed in Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this book we have a clear and full picture concerning God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What portrait of redemption could be clearer than that of the Passover?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not even in the New Testament do we find a more detailed picture.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Passover is a beautiful picture of our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this picture there is even an indication of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I once read an article describing how the Passover lamb was slain by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to this article, they took two wooden bars and formed a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then they tied two of the lamb s legs to the foot of the cross and fastened the other outstretched legs to the cross bar.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Following this, the lamb was slain so that all its blood was shed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, in the picture of the Passover we see the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, as we consider the portrait of the Passover, we receive a vivid impression of the powerfulness of the blood of the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Exodus 12:13 says, And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a wonderful picture is in Exodus, but not in Genesis.</S>
