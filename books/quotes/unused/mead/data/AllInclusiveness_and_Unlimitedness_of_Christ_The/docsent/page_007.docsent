   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Being a Man of Blood and Flesh Who Was Born of Blood and Flesh, Possessing the Perfect Human Nature</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This Christ is the complete God according to His divine nature and the perfect man according to His human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He is the complete God mingled with the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>C. Being One Who Is Both God and Man a God-man a Mingling of the Divine Nature with the Human Nature, without a Third Nature Being Produced D. Being the Embodiment of the Fullness of the Godhead of the Complete God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, He is One who is both God and man; He is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This God-man was a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, without a third nature being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This may be likened to soaking tea leaves in water to produce tea.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Neither the nature of the tea nor the nature of the water is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both natures still exist and are mingled together, without a third nature being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some people misunderstand us and say that concerning the God-man, we teach that the divine nature disappeared, the human nature was changed, and a third nature was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a heresy which we have never taught.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not what we have seen from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus is the mingling of two natures as one entity, without a third nature being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is One who is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope that you, brothers and sisters, will apply the effort to study so that you may know how the Lord Jesus as God is all-inclusive and unlimited and how He as a man is also all-inclusive and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If He was merely a man and not the God-man, then He could neither be all-inclusive nor unlimited since, as we all know, man is neither all-inclusive nor unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, because as the God-man the Lord Jesus was God mingled with man, and since God is all-inclusive and unlimited, the Lord Jesus as such a man was also all-inclusive and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This may be likened to a glass of plain water which is without any flavor, but when tea is added, the flavor gets into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man is finite, but when he has God mingled with him, he becomes infinite.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man is not all-inclusive, but when he has God mingled with him, he becomes all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE SIN-BEARING GOD-MAN IN HIS VICARIOUS DEATH THE REDEEMER</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Finally, Christ is the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all know that Jesus is the Redeemer, but what we know is too general, too vague, and too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must study in depth the statuses in which He came to be our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. As the One Who Is Both God and Man, Passing through Death in His Humanity with His Divinity</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Who was the One who was crucified on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Was He God?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some may not dare to answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Can God be crucified?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No one believes that man can nail God on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God cannot be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Who, then, was put to death on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should say that the One who was both God and man was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the cross, He was crucified in His humanity with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Strictly speaking, He did not die there, but He passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Dying is one thing, and passing through death is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we humans die, we truly die.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, instead of dying, He passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even His death was His work; He did a great deal of work at the time of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What work did He do?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He did a saving and redeeming work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His saving and His redeeming were accomplished through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Human death cannot accomplish anything, but the Lord Jesus' death on the cross was His great work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time the One whom the Jews arrested was not merely God but a man, yet that man had God inside of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, the One whom they crucified was not merely God but a man, but that man had God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the One who died on the cross was both God and man, and His death was a death in humanity with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, He did not die there, strictly speaking; rather, He passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Jews thought that when they killed Him, everything would be over.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, this was not the case with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the contrary, His crucifixion offered Him the best opportunity to be exceedingly active and to do a great amount of work in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, He did not merely die but passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>B. As a Created Man, Bearing Man's Sins and Dying for Every Created Thing</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Second, He died on the cross as a created man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since He had blood and flesh, He was truly a man, and since He was a man, He was a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today some Christians oppose this truth, but Paul said that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He bore the sins of the world as a created man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If He were not a man, how could He have borne our sins and died for us?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He tasted death on behalf of every created thing; that is, He died for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since He was a created man, as such, He bore all our wrong doings, trespasses, and sinful acts and died on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When He died there, He died on behalf of every created thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When man sinned, he defiled every created thing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, all created things needed Christ to taste death on their behalf.</S>
