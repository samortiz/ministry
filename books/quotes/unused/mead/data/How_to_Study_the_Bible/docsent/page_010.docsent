   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some have said that the blood of the Lord Jesus gives us life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This means that our new life is based on the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They say that when we drink the Lord's blood, we acquire His life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They quote Leviticus 17:14, which says that life is in the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we read this verse in a superficial way, we may agree with this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the blood does not bring us a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Blood is for redemption; it is to satisfy God's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Exodus 12:13 gives us the governing principle concerning the blood: "When I see the blood, I will pass over you."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The blood is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is to satisfy God's demand, not our demand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is only one instance in the Bible where the blood is spoken of as being for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In that place it says that the blood is applied to our conscience Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, even the conscience is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What then is the meaning of the word life in Leviticus 17?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word life there is the same as soul in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It refers to the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus poured out His soul-life unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Isaiah 53:12 says that He poured out His soul unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus shed His blood, that is, poured out His soul unto death for the accomplishment of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He cried on the cross, "Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit" Luke 23:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Having said this He expired.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His body was hung on the cross, and His soul, through the blood, was poured out for the accomplishment of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The characteristic of man is his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A sinful soul has to die; that is, the seat of a man's personality must die.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the same time He committed His spirit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John 6 says several times that those who eat the Lord's flesh as well as take His blood will have life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It also says that those who eat His flesh will have life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But at no time does it say that those who only drink His blood will have life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a man drinks His blood, he also must eat His flesh before he will have life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to learn to be careful persons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we mix up what God has separated, we will end up misunderstanding what He has said.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot expound the Bible carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must study God's word carefully, find the hundreds of instances where the blood is spoken of, and study them one by one before we will see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The blood is to satisfy God's demand; it is not to satisfy our demand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose John Wesley came and told us, "The Lord Jesus' blood will cleanse our heart and eradicate the root of sin from us, and we will sin no longer."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What should we say?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should say, "The blood of the Lord Jesus has never cleansed our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible never says that the Lord Jesus' blood will cleanse our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has given us a new heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man's heart is more wicked than all things and can never be cleansed."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The blood is for redemption, not for cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is for forgiveness, not for sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is a difference between sanctification before God and sanctification before men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some may ask, "Does not Hebrews 10 tell us that the blood of the Lord cleanses our heart?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Translator's note: This is the rendering in the Chinese Union Version.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The book of Hebrews speaks of the sprinkling of the conscience 10:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The conscience is only a part of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The only part within man that is conscious of sin is the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The blood satisfies God's demand and also satisfies our conscience's cry.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we realize that the Lord Jesus has redeemed us from sin, spontaneously our conscience will no longer be conscious of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The function of the blood in our conscience is not to free us from sin but to remove our consciousness of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Freedom from sin is the result of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The work of the blood is different from the work of the Holy Spirit; we should never confuse the two.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before the Lord we have to develop the habit of being accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are inaccurate, we will sacrifice God's accuracy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have a habit of being inaccurate, we will not get anything when we read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to realize how accurate the Bible is.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is so accurate that it has no room for any confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must be trained by the Lord to be accurate.</S>
