   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORK OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After a brother is saved, he may become clearer concerning all kinds of scriptural knowledge from Genesis to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He may be able to compose better prayers, and his prayers may begin to sound very nice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, these are all mud; they are all put onto the side of the wall and are not added on top of the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These are works of men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because of this, after five years, the wall will remain two feet high, and God's life will not have grown in that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the other hand, suppose this brother beats his wife at home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What should we say to him?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When many pastors, elders, and workers hear this, they will probably pray for this brother in private, and they will discuss how they should help him to read Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After this they may pray together, saying, "Lord, we are going to visit this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please go with us, and make this brother open to our exhortations."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later they may go to this brother's house, and they may say, "You are wrong as a husband."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may also say to the wife, "You are also wrong as a wife."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After much speaking, the brother may confess that he is wrong, and he may agree that he will no longer lose his temper with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The preacher may go on, praying, "Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This brother is now open to our exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We now commit him to the Lord's hand, and we pray that the Lord will cause him not to lose his temper anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Outwardly speaking, this way seems to work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But actually, what they are doing is but the work of a barber.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They may cut a person's hair today, but soon afterward, that person's hair will grow back, and they will have to give him another haircut.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the work of Confucius' disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This kind of teaching is the teaching of the Chinese ethical classics.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No wonder when Christianity came to China, the disciples of Confucius said that Confucius' teachings are much better than those of this foreign religion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, if we take the Bible as a means for teaching others or improving others, we are taking the Bible as mere teachings only.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A wife once came to me and said, "My husband beats me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Don't you know that he is your brother?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Your brother always loses his temper at home."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She went on with tears, "Yesterday he beat me again."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ordinarily, when a man hears such a word, he would go to exhort the husband, with the hope that the husband would change his ways.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may say, "If I do not exhort him to change his ways, what should I ask him to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You can only do such a thing because you are a person who is given to exhorting others and helping others to improve themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is all you can do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you do not do this, you will be out of a job.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Please do not misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although I will pray for such a husband, my prayer will be different from your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If this brother comes to me, I will say to him, "How do you feel when you beat your wife?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He may say, "After I beat my wife, I feel terrible inside for a week."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I will then tell him, "If you feel that you will feel comfortable inside by beating your wife, you can go ahead and beat her some more."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I will not tell him not to beat his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead, I will ask him how he feels inside.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If this brother is touched by God, he will feel deep within that he has offended God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You can teach others from the Bible, and you can exhort others with your theology.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if you do this, you are not the disciple of Christ; you are the disciple of Confucius instead.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By so doing, you will never convey God's life to people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a pitiful work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you buy a pen and a piece of paper, you can draw a beautiful chrysanthemum flower.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if I take a chrysanthemum seed, plant it in the ground, water it regularly, and then go to sleep, soon what the chrysanthemum seed produces will be more beautiful than what I draw on the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today, our work is not to teach others according to the Bible, but to plant God's life contained in the Bible into others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The material, goal, and design of God's work are simply God Himself, and this work is to work God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>GOD AND MAN MINGLED AS ONE</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do you want to know how to be a real husband or wife?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The way to be a real husband is not to be a husband.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The real way to be a wife is not to be a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not think that loving your husband means to do many things for him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To love your husband does not mean that you buy some fabric and make some clothing for him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The real love is for you not to do anything and for God to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God is not doing many things for man; He is working Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The reason God was incarnated was to put Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is real love.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The real love is for you not to be yourself, but to be the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The highest point of God's love is for Him to lay aside Himself; He would no longer be God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instead, He would be a man and be the same as man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today we have to pray, "God, although I am a man, I would give up being a man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I will accept You and allow You to work Yourself into me."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the sweetest thought.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In eternity God will say, "O man, you have God's nature," while you can say, "O God, the majestic God, You also have our nature, the human nature."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the picture in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ bears our human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In heaven He is God, yet He still bears our human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What is His work today?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>One day, when eternity comes, man will say joyfully, "God is like man," and God will say joyfully, "Man is like God."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In Shanghai I met a couple who had been married for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The two were similar in their minds and in the way they thought and acted.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They had loved each other for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As a result, the male was like the female, and the female was like the male.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Why were they so similar?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is because the male no longer lived as the male, and the female no longer lived as the female.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The male lived as the female, and the female lived as the male.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the end, the two had become more or less the same.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the relationship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God is our spiritual Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Because He loves us, He lives in the likeness of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we love God, we should also live in the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In the end, God will be in man, and man will be in God.</S>
