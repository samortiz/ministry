   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the One in resurrection, He surely has a way to overcome difficulties and barriers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the troubles concerning our fellowship with Christ come from our side.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many "hills" and "mountains" frustrate us from coming to Him, but He is never frustrated, for He can "leap" and "skip."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How can we go to the cleft of the rock, to the covert of the precipice?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not have the strength to do this.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart" S.S. 2:9a . The word hind in the title of Psalm 22, which is concerned with resurrection, signifies Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ's being like a young hart signifies that His power is the power of resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Now he stands behind our wall" v. 9b . His standing behind "our wall" signifies that the lover's introspection as the problem in her self is a separation between her and Him.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Glancing through the Lattice</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"He is looking through the windows,/He is glancing through the lattice" v. 9c . The windows and the lattice signify the openings set up by God for Him to fellowship, to commune, with her.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No matter how much we try to hide ourselves secretly, there is a window that Christ can see through.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because man became fallen, there seemed to be no way for God to touch man or have fellowship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the conscience of man is the window with a lattice, which is open for God to come in to contact fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should keep this in mind when we go out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we are preaching the gospel, we need to learn how to touch others' conscience.</S>
