   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ministering the Word</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the one hand, God wants us to understand His Word this is the beginning of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the other hand, He desires to place one or two words in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These words become a burden to us, and He desires that we minister these one or two words to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Acts 6:4 says, "But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ministry is service, and the ministry of the word is a service that serves men with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is our problem?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our problem is that we have the word within us but cannot release it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some people have a word and a very heavy burden within their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They want to convey this word to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet as they speak on the platform, the burden is bound within them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After speaking one or two sentences, a minute, or even an hour, the burden is still not released.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word cannot be released, and the outer man cannot convey the inward burden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They want to discharge the burden and the message that is within them, but their outer man cannot provide them with any utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No matter how much they speak, they feel that the burden remains unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They come with a burden and leave with the same burden.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The only explanation for this is that their outer man is not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their outer man cannot render any help to their inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the contrary, it becomes a stumbling block to the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If our outer man is broken, it is easy to say what we want to say.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we have a burden or a word within, our outer man will come up with a suitable word to fitly express our inner thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As soon as the word within us is released, the burden within us is lifted as well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more we speak, the lighter we will feel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will realize that our work is to serve the church with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the burden within must be matched by suitable words from our thoughts without.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the outer man is not broken, it will not yield to the will of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It will not obey the inner feeling or the spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the outer man tries to probe the feeling of the inner man, it will find nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It will not find the necessary and suitable words, and God will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God will be stalled and blocked, and the church will not receive any help.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must remember that the outer man constitutes the greatest hindrance to the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many people think that cleverness is somewhat useful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No matter how clever a person is, the outer man can never replace the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The inner man will come up with the right thoughts and proper words to flow out only as the outer man is broken and smashed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The outer shell must be broken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more this shell is broken, the more the life in the spirit will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the shell remains, the burden in the spirit will remain, and God's life and power will not flow to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such a person will not be able to serve as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's power and life primarily are released through the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the outer man is not smitten and does not have any open wounds, the inner man will have no outlet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who come for the message will hear sound only; they will not touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The speaker may be eager to deliver something, but the audience will not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He will have the word within him, but he will not be able to speak it out because his outer man is blocking the way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We find a precious story in the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A person touched only the hem of His garment, and she received His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The hem of His garment is the outermost part of His being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This person could feel His power even in His outermost part.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The problem with us is that we have God's life within us, but this life cannot flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have the word within us, but we cannot release this word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have God's word within us, but we have obstacles around us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As a result, this word cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When God does not have any freedom in us, He cannot flow freely out of us.</S>
