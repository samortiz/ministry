<h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 21</h1><h2 class="head4">September 15, 1950</h2><h2 class="head1">SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY&mdash;<br />A RECORD OF A TALK WITH CO-WORKERS</h2><p>As we are gathered today, I think I have something to say. Let us first look at two passages of the Scripture.</p><p>Colossians 4:5 says, "Redeeming the time," and Ephesians 5:16 says, "Redeeming the time."</p><p>I have wanted to talk to you about this matter in these past few days. There are several Greek words for the word time, as it is translated in the two verses we just read. In both these passages, the Greek word is not chronos, but kairos. This word does not merely refer to time. There are many passages which use this Greek word in conjunction with other words, and in those instances it is translated opportunity. Galatians 6:10 says, "As we have the opportunity, let us do what is good toward all." This means that we should seize the opportunity to do good. These words from the Bible show us the Lord's thought about opportunity. The Lord considers opportunity to be something very important. One could translate the word time in the passages from Colossians and Ephesians as "redeeming the opportunity." I do not know how much you understand the word opportunity. I always wonder how many opportunities I have missed. In many matters, on the negative side, we do not know how many opportunities we have missed. Many things which we can do are all too easily missed by us. Many people which we can save are all too easily neglected by us. Many cities where we can start an assembly are all too easily overlooked by us. Many brothers whom we can gain are lost through us. We have lost so many opportunities! When we face the Lord in the future, we will truly have much regret to face! We are confused and unclear about everything, and we do not know how many opportunities we have missed!</p><p>Of the days which the Lord has ordained for us, perhaps yesterday should have been the greatest day of our life, but we may have lived yesterday in an ordinary way. This is what it means to miss the opportunity. One who is learning to serve should not do the same thing today as he did yesterday. If he is the same today as yesterday, he has squandered his opportunities. If we do not know what the Lord is doing today or what is going to happen today, we are missing the opportunity.</p><p>In the early days in Shanghai, the brothers did not pay attention to the need for a meeting hall. As a result, we do not know how many souls we lost. I want to say to the brothers who want to save their money, "You have indeed saved your money, but you have lost the souls of men!" We could have saved more souls, but because there was not enough space for them, some were lost. Losing a soul is losing an opportunity. Souls were lost when we saved our money. We now think that we have spent our all in moving from Hardoon Road to Nanyang Road. It may never have occurred to us that if we had not missed some opportunities before the Lord, certain kinds of meetings would never have been started. We have missed some opportunities, and as a result, some meetings were produced. It is very easy for us to work in a place in a habitual way. Every Lord's Day we preach the word; every week we have an edification meeting. We think it is all right if we gain ten to twenty people a week. We do not know that the Lord wanted us to gain one thousand in one day. Through negligence we lose nine hundred of them. We throw away and miss many opportunities.</p><p>As I was considering this whole matter, I thought perhaps the Lord would want to gain more people in Yangshupu than at Nanyang Road. But can we seize the opportunity? Perhaps the Lord wants to gain more people at North Szechuan Road than He does at Nanyang Road. Can we seize the opportunity? Perhaps the Lord wants to gain more people in Nanshi than He does at Nanyang Road. Can we grasp the opportunity? No worker or servant of the Lord can feel satisfied with what he has done so far. All who are satisfied with the present are losing opportunities. We do not know what great things the Lord wants to do. Among the 470 million people in China, there are only a few hundred thousand Christians. We do not know how many opportunities we have already lost! I believe that God has given more opportunities than we can imagine. If we can seize every opportunity God gives us, the increase of the work will be according to God's expectation. The work has not increased as God wants because we have limited it. We hope this limitation will end here today.</p>
