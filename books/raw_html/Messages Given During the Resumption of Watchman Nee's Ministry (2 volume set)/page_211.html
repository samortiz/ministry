<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Need to Know the Body</H2><P>The consciousness of sin comes from knowing God. In the same way, the consciousness of reviling words comes from the knowledge of the Body. Reviling words are opposed to the testimony of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Learning Not to Be the Head</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Submitting to the<br>Authority of the Head, and Being<br>the Authority One to Another</H2><P>The head manifests itself as the head by its ideas and proposals. The meaning of submitting to the authority of the Head is that one does not need to make many proposals and will not have many ideas of his own. A Christian who lives in the Body is a most simple person.</P><P>There is a basic difference between a Protestant's understanding of the Bible and a Catholic's understanding of the Bible. The Catholics think that the Pope is the only one who can make decisions on the interpretation of the Bible and that no ordinary person can interpret the Bible. The Pope's decision is the only decision. From this doctrine, many kinds of idolatry were developed, including the worship of Mary. Protestantism is more advanced than Catholicism. It claims that as many Christians as there are, there are that many popes, and that everyone can read the Bible and interpret it. If we have the light, we will see that both of them are wrong. In the Body, the Lord has only arranged for certain members to have the authority to make judgments on the interpretation of the Scriptures. Hence, do not try to be a pope in haste.</P><P>For example, the Lord has raised up some brothers among us to help us concerning the way of life. If any of the brothers have any question concerning the way of life, they can go to these brothers to seek for help. In the Body, there is not just one brother, but many brothers who can supply us life in many aspects. If you want to receive help from them, you have to realize that they have the ministry and that they have the authority. You have to submit yourselves to their authority. This authority is given to them by the Head. If any member of my body argues with my mouth or my eyes, it is arguing with the head who establishes those ministries. If a member does not submit to the function of these members, it is not submitting to the head. A rebellious person first demonstrates his rebellion through his words, then through his thoughts. The more simple you are, the more you can be one with others. It does not mean that when you submit to others, you do not have a ministry any longer. In the Body, we are authorities one to another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Ministry Being Authority</H2><P>Ministry is authority. When the Lord gives a ministry to a person, He is giving authority to that person. Many people are worried about many problems, but as a member we have to learn to remove our own heads. This is the meaning of the sisters' covering of their heads. Head covering means that only the Lord is the Head. This of course does not mean that the responsible brothers can make any proposal they want. A person who has been dealt with is one who does not like to interfere with others' affairs. Only after we become a person who has no interest in interfering with others' affairs can we be the authority; only then can we bear responsibility before God, and only then can we manage the affairs of the brothers and sisters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THOSE WHO<br>ARE IN AUTHORITY<br>NOT INTERFERING WITH OTHERS</H2><P>God never interferes with man, nor did He ever force man to do anything. The garden of Eden was not fenced with barbed wire, and hell does not have any fences either. If a man wants to go to hell, he can go in easily. All roads lead to hell. Today, in the twentieth century, man has invented the electric fence, and has installed twenty volts or sixty volts of electricity to these fences. But our God never interferes with man, nor forces man to do anything. All those who by nature like to meddle with others' affairs must be dealt with. Those who by nature like to control others can never be the authority. Those who are the authorities should let others know that they do not like to control others. They speak only because they have received authority from the Head. A man who has been taught and who has learned to be an authority will not answer questions in a light way.</P>
