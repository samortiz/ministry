   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through His all-inclusive death He dying in His fleshly shell Rom 8:3; Eph 2:15.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While He was dying in His fleshly shell, He growing in His divine life and entering into resurrection 1 Pet 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In His resurrection His divine life bearing fruit and multiplying into countless grains 1 Pet 1:3; John 12:24.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These countless grains being His many members which constitute His eternal, mystical Body 1 Cor 12:12, 27; 10:17.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This mystical Body being His eternal, boundless increase John 3:30.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This message is high, deep, and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may say that this is the highest, deepest, and most mysterious truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we need to calm down our entire being and allow the Lord to operate in every way in our spirit that we may be enlightened in our understanding and may have a sober mind to enter into this profound truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A HISTORY OF THE UNLOCKING OF THE BIBLICAL TRUTHS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible was completed at the end of the first century when the writing of Revelation was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, up to now, the believers' exposition and knowledge of the Bible have not reached the final point.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of course, as early as the second century, some great Bible expositors, who in church history are called the church fathers, had already interpreted a great deal concerning the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From that time until now, in every age there have been many who have studied and learned the biblical truths.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>History shows us that this study or learning is not individual but corporate, involving all the believers, and it is also progressive, becoming clearer century by century.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course, from A.D. 570, after the papal system had fully become established, the Bible was locked up for ten centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That period of time is referred to in history as the Dark Ages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For one thousand years, human society was in darkness because the Bible had been sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thereafter, Martin Luther and some of his contemporaries rose up to bring in the Reformation, and risking their lives, they opened the closed Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, printing was invented at that time, so the spreading of the Bible no longer depended on copying by hand but on printing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus the Bible was released from its imprisonment and could be distributed in large quantities.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, at that time the contents of the Bible were not very open, and people's understanding of the Bible was very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus the Bible seemed to remain a sealed book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the Reformation in the time of Martin Luther, throughout the centuries one Bible expositor after another was raised up to unravel some of the biblical truths.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the degree of the unraveling was very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This situation lasted for about four centuries, beginning from the time of Luther, through the time of Zinzendorf, and proceeding to the previous century, the nineteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the 1820s, the Lord raised up the Brethren in England.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once they were raised up, the light of the truths flooded like a waterfall.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From that time onward, the Bible was formally opened to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We thank and praise the Lord for this!</S>
