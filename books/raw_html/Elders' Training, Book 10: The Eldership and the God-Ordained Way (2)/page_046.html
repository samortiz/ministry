<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. THE TEST OF SOME BELIEVERS IN CORINTH<br>SAYING THAT THERE IS NO RESURRECTION OF<br>THE DEAD&#151;1 CORINTHIANS 15:12</H2><P>I do not believe that anyone among us has ever said that there is no resurrection of the dead. Therefore, in this sense we might be a little better than the churches established by Paul. In facing this test, the apostle corrected the heresy by unveiling the truth of resurrection (vv. 12-57) and by testifying to the fact of resurrection by the power and effectiveness of the resurrection of Christ (vv. 3-11). In 1 Corinthians 15:10, Paul said, "..not I, but the grace of God." The grace of God is the resurrected Christ. Christ in resurrection is the grace of God. Thus, Paul testified to the fact of resurrection not only by the power but also by the effectiveness of the resurrection of Christ, which he himself had experienced.</P><P>Paul's way of taking care of this test of heresy was excellent; but it requires the adequate knowledge of the divine truth in the New Testament teaching and the sufficient experience of the reality of the divine truth. Hence, we need to endeavor to get into the divine truths and to experience the reality of the divine truths that we may be able to take care of this kind of problem for the churches' profit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. THE TEST OF THE DISOBEDIENCE OF SOME OF<br>THE CORINTHIAN BELIEVERS&#151;2 CORINTHIANS 10:2-10</H2><P>In facing such a test, the apostles first fought the spiritual warfare to overthrow the strongholds in the believers' minds and to take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ (vv. 3-5). Then the apostles eventually would punish all disobedience among the believers (v. 6). Paul did not say that they would take revenge on persons, but that they would punish the disobedience of the disobedient ones.</P><P>To take care of such a case related to the spiritual warfare requires the spiritual insight to see thoroughly that the source of such a case is not in man but in the evil power of Satan and needs the ability in the divine life to fight against the evil source.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIV. THE TEST OF SOME PREACHING ANOTHER JESUS,<br>MINISTERING A DIFFERENT SPIRIT OR A DIFFERENT<br>GOSPEL, YET THE BELIEVERS IN CORINTH<br>BEARING WELL WITH THEM&#151;2 CORINTHIANS 11:4</H2><P>It is difficult to believe that in the apostolic church such a thing could have taken place. In Greek, bear well with him was used in an ironic sense. The Corinthian believers bore well with the heretical preachers. Taking this as a base, Paul said, ironically, that since they bore well with those heretical preachers, they should bear well with his boasting. The apostle boasted of his apostleship and his virtuous conduct by listing many items concerning himself (vv. 5-33). This shows that sometimes it is necessary to boast, making a defense and taking a standing for the benefit of the churches and the saints.</P>
