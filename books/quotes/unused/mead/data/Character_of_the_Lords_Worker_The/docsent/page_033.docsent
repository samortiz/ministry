   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is slothfulness?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is to procrastinate, to drag on for as long as possible, and to take time in doing something.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Perhaps a work can be finished in one day, yet the person drags it out for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Or it can be finished in a month, yet the person drags it out for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He takes his time to finish the work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is slothfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In some instances the word is translated "idle" Matt 20:3, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An idle person is one who mills around aimlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is tossed between acting and not acting, and his mind is never set on what should be done.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Philippians 3:1, it is translated "irksome."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul said, "To write the same things to you, for me it is not irksome, but for you it is safe."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As soon as you put something on the shoulders of some brothers and sisters, they are reluctant to take it up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is irksome to them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They sigh and grumble.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It seems as if they are being asked to take up an impossible task and that a very heavy burden has been placed upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But this is not the way Paul acted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was in prison when he wrote his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It would indeed be a challenge for anyone to write in a situation as dire as his.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet in writing to the Philippians, Paul exhorted them to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Rejoice in the Lord always" 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As far as his circumstances went, he was in grave hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet he said, "To write the same things to you, for me it is not irksome."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was not slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not consider it irksome; rather, he considered it a joyous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did not know the meaning of laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In him we find a zeal which is prominent among all servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are not slothful and do not consider it irksome to take challenges upon themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many brothers and sisters have become useless in God's service because they are afraid to take on any responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are irked by everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They constantly hope for less work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They would rather choose less responsibility than more responsibility, and they would be happy to settle for no responsibility at all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not have a diligent character.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are lazy, we are disqualified not only from God's service, but from man's service as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many brothers and sisters cannot be servants of the Lord because they are lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some so-called servants of God sit high on a pedestal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seems as if no one has control over them; no brother or sister can touch them, and no one can say anything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They regard themselves as servants of God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If their master was changed for a brief moment, they would be shown to be total failures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No human master would allow them to be as sloppy as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our disposition and walk must be so exercised that we would never shrink back from troubles, but would instead prefer service and sacrifice for God's people, both materially and physically.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should prefer to labor and work with our own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If this is not our way, we are not qualified to be called God's servants!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul said, "You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me" Acts 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He had two good hands; they were not slothful at all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They worked during the day and during the night.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a person is truly a servant of God.</S>
