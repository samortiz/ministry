<p class="bold">WEEK 15 — DAY 2</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 20:1-2, 8-16</h2><p class="bold">1 &nbsp;For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, who is a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.</p> <p class="bold">2 &nbsp;And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</p><p>8 &nbsp;And when evening fell, the master of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning from the last ones to the first.</p><p>9 &nbsp;And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius.</p><p>10 &nbsp;And when the first ones came, they supposed that they would receive more. And they themselves also received each a denarius.</p> <p>11 &nbsp;And when they received it, they murmured against the householder,</p> <p>12 &nbsp;Saying, These last ones worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the scorching heat.</p><p>13 &nbsp;But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I am doing nothing unrighteous to you. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</p> <p class="bold">14 &nbsp;Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last one even as I have given to you.</p><p class="bold">15 &nbsp;Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine? Or is your eye evil because I am good?</p><p class="bold">16 &nbsp;Thus shall the <sup>1</sup>last be first and the first last.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The householder [in verse 1] is Christ. Morning here is 6:00 a.m., denoting the earliest part of the church age, when Christ came to call His disciples into the kingdom. The workmen denote the disciples, and the vineyard denotes the kingdom. The agreement referred to in verse 2 denotes the agreement He made in 19:27-29. The denarius is the reward the Lord offered Peter in His agreement with him in 19:27-29.</p><p>According to verse 8, the householder rewarded the workmen at evening, that is, at 6:00 p.m., denoting the end of the church age.…Verse 8 says, “And when evening fell, the master of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning from the last ones to the first.” This is against the natural and commercial concept. It indicates that the wages paid to the last workmen are not according to their work but according to the gracious wish of the Lord of the vineyard.</p><p>Much to the surprise of those hired first, the last were the first to receive the reward, although they worked just one hour, not during the heat of the day.…Those hired first should remember Romans 9:14-15 and 20. There is no unrighteousness with the Lord. He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy. Who were they to reply against the Lord? [Matt. 20:11-12]. But Peter’s natural concept, representing that of all believers, was commercial; he did not know the Lord’s gracious wish. Thus, he murmured against the Lord according to legality.</p><p>To be saved is to receive grace, and to gain the reward is to enjoy the grace we have received.…After receiving grace we must learn to enjoy grace. To leave all things behind and follow the Lord is not to pay a price; it is to enjoy the grace we have received. Do not think that you have sacrificed anything. What you sacrifice is just dung; it is vanity of vanities. Everything under the sun is vanity. Your education, position, and future are all vanity.…To leave all things behind is to be unloaded and released.…If we have given up all things for the Lord in a proper spirit, we would say, “O Lord,…I am not paying a price—I am daily enjoying grace.” (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 642-644, 646)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>16<sup>1</sup> The last are the latest workmen, and the first are the earliest ones. In working, the earliest come first, but in receiving the reward, the last become the first. It is in this way that the Lord makes the last first and the first last.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 642-647; Hymns: #497</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
