 <h2 class="head1">GIFTS, MINISTRIES, AND OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 12:4 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;But there are distributions of gifts, but the same Spirit.&rdquo; &ldquo;But&rdquo; here indicates a contrast between verses 3 and 4. Verse 3 says when we minister by speaking in the Spirit of God, we all say &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; exalting Jesus as Lord. &ldquo;But&rdquo; the gifts for the manifestation of the Spirit are diverse. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;distributions&rdquo; in this verse, as well as in verses 5 and 6, means diversities, varieties, distinctions.</p>
<p>The gifts in verse 4 refer to the outward gifts, the ability or enablement for service. Some of them are miraculous, and some are developed out of the initial gifts mentioned in 1:7. In 1:7 &ldquo;gift&rdquo; refers to the inward gifts issuing from grace, such as the free gift of eternal life (Rom. 6:23) and the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38) as the heavenly gift (Heb. 6:4), not the outward, miraculous gifts. All the gifts in chapter twelve are different from the initial gifts.</p>
<p>Verse 5 continues, &ldquo;And there are distributions of ministries, and the same Lord.&rdquo; These ministries are services. The gifts in verse 4 are for these services and they are for the operations in verse 6.</p>
<p>In verse 6 Paul says, &ldquo;And there are distributions of operations, but the same God, who is operating all things in all.&rdquo; These operations are works. The ministries or services in verse 5 are for these works.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OPERATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
IN OUR SPEAKING</h2>
<p>In 12:4-6 the gifts are by the Spirit; the ministries, the services, are for the Lord; and the operations are of God. Here the Triune God is involved in these three things&mdash;gifts, ministries, and operations. The gifts by the Spirit are to carry out the ministries, the services, for the Lord. The ministries for the Lord are to accomplish the operations, the works, of God. This is the Triune God moving in the believers for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose to build up the church, the Body of Christ, for the expression of God.</p>
<p>We have emphasized the fact that the gifts in chapter twelve are much related to our speaking. Whenever we speak, the Spirit works. We may think that we are the ones functioning in speaking; actually the Spirit is the one who functions. As we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord ministers, and God operates. Our speaking, therefore, is of great importance. If we do not speak, the Spirit does not function, the Lord does not minister, and God does not operate. In a very real sense, the Triune God is waiting for us to speak something for Him.</p>
<p>The Spirit desires to function, the Lord wants to minister, and God intends to operate. But this depends on our exercising our spirit in speaking forth the Lord. Our speaking is crucial to God&rsquo;s operation. If we do not speak, if we are silent or dumb, the Triune God will be silent. But the more we speak by exercising our spirit, the more the Spirit will function, the Lord will minister, and God will operate. When we speak, the Spirit functions. When the Spirit functions, the Lord ministers. When the Lord ministers, God operates. Therefore, the functioning, ministering, and operating of the Triune God depend on our speaking.</p>
<p>Both in the meetings and in our practical, daily living, the Triune God responds to our speaking in our spirit by functioning, ministering, and operating. Let us suppose that a brother, his wife, and his children are having fellowship during a meal. As they all speak, the Spirit comes forth to function. Then the Lord follows to minister, and God operates. Many of us can testify of having this kind of experience in our daily life as well as in the meetings.</p>
<p>If we desire to have more of this kind of experience, we need to learn to stop gossiping. If we engage in gossip or vain talk, we shall not experience the operation of the Triune God in our speaking. We need to speak Christ, grace, and salvation. Because the Spirit is joined to our regenerated human spirit, whenever we speak these wonderful matters, the Spirit will function. Following the function of the Spirit, the Lord, who is one with the Spirit, will minister. When the Lord ministers, God the Father operates. This is the operation of the Triune God in our speaking in the Spirit.</p>
