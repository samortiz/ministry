   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EMOTION AND WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Elsewhere we have emphasized that only the spirit can do spiritual work; all other works are without spiritual value.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because this point is so important, we will now go into more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today men pay much attention to human psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some who work for the Lord diligently study psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They think that if their words, teachings, presentations, attitudes, and interpretations can appeal to man's psychology, they will win many people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This psychology is the working of man's emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although it may prove useful at times, dependence on emotion alone has no spiritual significance at all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We already know that man's lack is regeneration the regeneration of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A work is absolutely useless if it cannot cause man's deadened spirit to be enlivened, cause man to receive God's uncreated life, and cause man to have the Holy Spirit indwell his regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the purpose of the believer's work is not to impart life to others, the result of his preaching is no different than if he exhorted people to worship the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Neither our psychology nor other's psychology can help them receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Unless the Holy Spirit Himself does the work, everything is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A believer must realize that his emotion is altogether natural; it is not the source of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>May he truly acknowledge the fact that his emotion is void of God's life!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, he must not consider using the power of his emotion through tears, a sad countenance, weeping, or other emotional expressions to save people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>None of the functions of his emotion can influence man's darkened spirit in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Unless the Holy Spirit gives life to man, no one can receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not depend on the Holy Spirit, but depend on the emotion instead, we will see that all of our work's efforts are futile and bear no real fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Emotion can never give life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who work for the Lord must clearly see that if they depend on themselves, nothing in them can generate God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can exhaust every psychological method to excite man's emotion to arouse his interest toward religion; we can make him feel repentant, sorrowful, and shameful for his past history and fearful of the coming judgment; we can cause him to admire Christ, desire to contact other Christians, and be merciful to the poor; we can even make him feel happy while doing all of these things, yet we still cannot cause him to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether we cause interest, regret, sorrow, shame, fear, admiration, desire, mercy, joy, etc., all of these are just the various functions of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man can have them all and still be spiritually dead, because he has not apprehended God intuitively.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From our human viewpoint, is not someone who possesses these qualities a first-class Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, these are only the impulses of the emotion and cannot sufficiently prove one's regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The manifestation of regeneration is apprehension of God in the intuition of the regenerated one, i.e., his spirit is quickened.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, when we work, we must not think that it is sufficient for men to change their attitude toward us, have a good feeling about us, and display all the previously mentioned emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not regeneration!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the workers of the Lord would remember that our aim is to help people receive the life of Christ, they would never use their emotion to make people approve of Christ's teaching and express a good feeling toward Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we clearly acknowledge that man lacks God's life the quickening of the spirit we will realize that all the work which has been done by relying on ourselves is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No matter how a man changes, he can only change within the boundary of his "self."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He can never step outside this boundary and change his own life into the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, may we truly see the reality that "a spiritual aim needs spiritual means."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our spiritual aim is to cause people to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, when we work we must only resort to spiritual means; emotion is of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The apostle Paul said that every woman who prays or prophesies must have her head covered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Concerning this matter, there are many diverse explanations and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although we will not decide here which interpretation is right, one thing is clear: the apostle's intention was to prevent the functioning of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He intended to cover up all that arouses the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is particularly easy for a woman who preaches and prays to arouse people's emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From a physical standpoint, only the head is seemingly covered, but from a spiritual standpoint, the purpose of the covering is to put to death all the things that belong to emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although in the Bible, brothers are not physically allowed to have their heads covered, in a spiritual sense, brothers must have their heads covered just like the sisters!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From this we can see that emotion may easily be expressed in the Lord's work; otherwise, the apostle would not have needed to give this kind of prohibition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In spiritual work today nearly the greatest problem is whether or not there is a power of attraction.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It seems that those who have a natural attraction have the upper hand, and that the result of their work is superior to others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who have no natural attraction are seemingly defeated, and the achievement of their work is inferior to others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The apostle's intention was to cover up everything belonging to the soul, regardless of whether it was naturally attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All that is natural must be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, all the Lord's servants must learn this lesson from the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our natural attraction cannot help our spiritual work, neither can our lack of natural attraction hinder it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let us refrain from all such thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we consider our power of attraction, we will lose our heart of dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Similarly, if we consider our lack of attraction, we will not walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Unless the workers of the Lord walk according to the spirit, all the results of their work will be vain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What are the workers of the Lord seeking today?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many seek for spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But real spiritual power comes from paying a price.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As long as we are dead toward our emotions, we will have spiritual strength.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We lose spiritual strength because we use too much of our emotion and have so much desire, affection, and feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not walk according to the feelings of our emotions, and in everything deliver to death our own desires and actions which cause us to be happy, we would see strength and power in our human lives.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The deeper death of the cross can fill us with spiritual power; other than this, there is no way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the cross deals with our desires and enables us to live for God, spiritual power spontaneously will be manifested from us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Furthermore, if a believer does not overcome his emotion in spiritual work, the emotion will hinder him in many ways from going on.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As long as the influence of the emotion is present, the believer's spiritual strength is not sufficient to regulate his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, he cannot fulfill the highest will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The emotion will use all kinds of things to hinder the work from going on.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Let us see the example of our physical weariness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to distinguish whether our need for rest is due to 1 bodily fatigue, 2 emotional weariness, or 3 both bodily fatigue and emotional weariness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God does not want us to overwork our spirit, our soul, or our body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God desires us to rest when we are tired.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But we need to know whether our need for rest is related to bodily fatigue or emotional weariness, or whether our emotional weariness is using some fatigue in the body as an excuse to demand rest.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many times our desire for rest is really laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Our body needs to rest and so does our mind and spirit, but we should not rest because of a laziness which comes from the evil nature of our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Laziness and weariness use physical fatigue as an alibi.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In short, our emotion is pleasure-seeking and self-entertaining.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The believer should guard against it creeping in during their proper rest.</S>
