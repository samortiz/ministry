[1]  AN INTRODUCTION Scripture Reading: Gen 1:1, 2, 9-12, 26, 27, 29; 7:17; 8:1, 13, 22; 12:1, 7; Exo 3:8; 6:8; Ezek.
[2]  In this series of messages we want to see something of the land of Canaan, which is the type of the all-inclusive Christ.
[3]  We also want to see how the city and the temple, which were built on this land of Canaan, are types of the fullness of Christ, which is His Body, the church.
[4]  Remember well that it is not just Christ and the church but the all-inclusive Christ and the fullness of Christ which is His Body, the church.
[5]  Brothers and sisters, I would by the grace of God tell you in truth that the real things are nothing but Christ Himself.
[6]  You may be quite clear that Christ is your food, that Christ is your living water, that Christ is your light, and that Christ is your life.
[7]  This temple within the city was built on that piece of land, and this piece of land with the temple and the city built upon it is the very center of the Old Testament Scriptures.
[8]  If we know the Scriptures and have light from God, we will realize that the center of God s eternal plan, typically speaking, is the land with its temple and the city.
[9]  Never forget, this land is the all-inclusive Christ.
[10]  If I were to ask you if you have Christ, you would answer, Oh, praise the Lord, I have Him; I have Christ!
[11]  But I would ask you what kind of Christ you have.
[12]  I am afraid that in your experience you have just a little Christ, a poor Christ, not an all-inclusive Christ.
[13]  You can say that you enjoy the lamb as your passover and the Lord as your daily manna, but very few can really say that they enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the land.
[14]  Now I would ask you to consider: If we have been rooted in Christ, then what is Christ to us?
[15]  I mean this: if you have received light to see that in God s mind Christ is everything, the Holy Spirit will lead you to the place where you realize that even the words you speak day by day must be Christ.
[16]  ITS SPACIOUSNESS Scripture Reading: Deut 12:9; Heb 4:8, 9, 11; Eph 3:17, 18; Phil 3:7, 8, 10, 12-14; Exo 3:8; Deut 4:25
[17]  We have seen in the Old Testament that the land with its temple and city is the center of God s plan.
[18]  What God planned to do on this earth was to obtain that piece of land with the temple and the city built upon it.
[19]  God s presence and God s authority could only be realized by the temple and the city built upon that piece of land.
[20]  Whatever you need, whatever you contact, whatever you obtain, whatever you enjoy, whatever you experience all these things must be Christ.
[21]  Whenever you do something, whenever you enjoy something, whenever you use something, you must immediately apply Christ.
[22]  We must realize why God said that this land was the rest for His people.
[23]  Christ is the breadth, Christ is the length, Christ is the height, and Christ is the depth of the whole universe.
[24]  One day a brother came to me, saying, It is rather difficult for me to understand the difference between our patience, and love and the patience and love of Christ.
[25]  What is our patience, and what is the patience of Christ?
[26]  Brother, he continued, how can I know whether I am loving a person with my love or with the love of Christ?
[27]  I considered, and then I said to him, If the love with which you love others is the love of Christ, it is unlimited; it can never be exhausted.
[28]  If you are patient with Christ s patience, the more wrongly you are treated, the more patient you will be.
[29]  Oh, brothers, I do not like to speak much about myself, but I can testify that the Christ we experience is an unlimited Christ.
[30]  Whenever you feel depressed in spirit or in heart, it means that you are under the threatening of death, you are under the power of darkness.
[31]  You must learn how to apply Christ, the ascended Christ, to your situation.
[32]  When you contact Him, you will be resurrected, you will be ascended, for the Christ whom you contact is the Christ who has ascended to the heavens.
[33]  The problem is that whenever you feel depressed, you forget Christ; you forget that you have such a Christ who is ascended far above all.
[34]  We will continue to see the goodness of the land.
[35]  If you reflect upon your experience and consider it carefully, you will realize that in one aspect Christ is so spacious and exhaustless and in another aspect Christ is transcendent and in the heavens.
[36]  Deuteronomy says that these waters are flowing forth from the valleys and the mountains.
[37]  Try to experience Christ and apply Christ when you are in all kinds of suffering; then you will have something which not only refreshes yourself, but also flows forth to water others.
[38]  Oh, you can realize, when you are contacting Christ, when you are enjoying and experiencing Christ so that His life is flowing forth from within you, what a deep sense of the presence of God you will have!
[39]  You will experience His eyes upon you from the beginning of the year to the end of the year simply because you are in Christ, you are enjoying Christ, and you are experiencing Christ.
[40]  Because you are practically joined with Christ, you will not only experience Christ as the living water, but you will enjoy the presence of God.
[41]  We have seen that there are many types of Christ in the Old Testament, but only one is the all-inclusive type of Christ, that is, the land of Canaan.
[42]  If I invite you to a meal, I will give you something to drink, and I will also give you something to eat.
[43]  It is not my object just to give some doctrinal teaching.
[44]  Brothers and sisters, whenever you are put into a situation by the Lord s sovereignty in which you are limited, in which you are pressed, you may experience the Lord as wheat.
[45]  When in the midst of that limiting and pressing situation you contact the Lord, He is just as a grain of wheat to you.
[46]  Oh, that life which is Christ Himself within you is a grain of wheat.
[47]  When in a certain environment in which you are restricted and suppressed you have a living touch with Christ, you will say, O Lord, You are the infinite God, but You did become a finite man.
[48]  If you have the resurrected Christ, even if the apostle Paul were there, you will say, Praise the Lord, my brother has the resurrected Christ, and I have Him too.
[49]  Brothers and sisters, if you will take my word, believe in the resurrected Christ, and apply Him, you will find that the remainder abiding in you is more than that with which you started.
[50]  In one sense it depicts the sacrificing Christ, the Christ who has sacrificed everything of Himself.
[51]  When in this situation we come to contact the Lord, it is then that we experience Him as the wine-producing vine; we experience Christ as the One who gives cheer to God and cheer to others.
[52]  If all the brothers and sisters are happy with you, I am sure that to a greater or lesser degree you are experiencing Christ in this aspect; you are experiencing Christ as a wine producer.
[53]  If you contact this Christ and experience His sacrificing life, He will energize you, He will strengthen you to sacrifice for God and for others.
[54]  ITS UNSEARCHABLE RICHES 3 FOOD 2 Scripture Reading: Deut 8:7, 8; 7:13; 32:13, 14; Judg.
[55]  From our experience we realize that the more we enjoy Christ as the wheat, as the barley, and as the vine, the more we experience the sweetness and the satisfaction of Christ.
[56]  We come now to the fifth item, the pomegranates.
[57]  When you see a ripe pomegranate, you immediately realize the abundance and the beauty of life.
[58]  When you enjoy and experience Christ as the wheat, as the barley, as the vine, and as the fig tree, the beauty of Christ is about you, the abundance of the life of Christ is with you.
[59]  If you enjoy Christ as the resurrected One and by the power of His resurrection you live the life of Jesus on this earth to suffer all kinds of pressure, persecutions, troubles, and conflicts, you will realize the sweetness and satisfaction of Christ within you, and you will manifest the beauty and the abundance of life to others.
[60]  We must realize that Christ is the Son of oil; Christ is the man anointed with the Holy Spirit of God.
[61]  Now let us go on to see something concerning the animal life.
[62]  Oh, the aspects of Christ in the land are so many and rich!
[63]  With the Lord Jesus Christ, there is the aspect of the vegetable life and the aspect of the animal life.
[64]  But you must realize that you can never simply apply Christ as the barley, because you are a sinner, you have sinned.
[65]  When you enjoy Christ as the wheat, the barley, the vine, etc., and at the same time you enjoy Him as the bullock and as the lamb, you will realize that the Lord is so good, that the Lord is so sweet and so rich to you, just as milk and honey.
[66]  1 Peter 2:4-5: Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[67]  We have seen that the land is rich first in waters, second in vegetables and plants, third in animals, and last in mines or minerals.
[68]  By experiencing Christ as the living water, you will find growing in this water different kinds of plants; you experience Christ as your food supply.
[69]  But when you are really mature in the life of Christ, Christ will be just as milk and honey to you through the whole day.
[70]  When you first come to receive Christ, you feel that you are drinking the living water, but when you are matured in Christ, you feel day by day that you are drinking milk and honey.
[71]  When we are just babes in Christ, drinking the living water, how is it possible for the building of the Lord to be among us?
[72]  We must be grown; we must be matured by experiencing Christ.
[73]  The Lord is the living stone, and we too must be the living stones so that we may be material for His building.
[74]  ITS UNSEARCHABLE RICHES 5 MINERALS 2 Scripture Reading: Deut 8:9; 33:25; Jer 15:12; Rev 2:27; 1:15; Matt 28:18; Luke 10:19; Matt 16:18, 19; 18:17, 18; Eph 6:11-17
[75]  We have seen clearly that the riches of the land are firstly in waters, secondly in all kinds of vegetables and plants, thirdly in cattle and flocks, and fourthly in mines or minerals.
[76]  If you invite me to dinner, you must give me some solid food, some wheat or some barley, etc. It is indeed wonderful, then, that at the end of the plants and vegetables is the olive tree, representing Christ as the Son of oil, the One who is full of the Holy Spirit.
[77]  Sometimes when you are following the Lord, while you are serving the Lord, or perhaps while you are coming to a meeting to minister, a thought of how dirty and sinful you are enters your mind.
[78]  Yes, you ask the Lord to cover you with His precious blood and cover your mind with Himself.
[79]  Then in faith you exercise your spirit and say to the enemy, Satan, I am dirty, I am sinful; but praise my Lord, He is the perfect One, He is the One who has been tested and proved, and He is my covering, He is the helmet for my head!
[80]  CHAPTER NINE HOW TO POSSESS THE LAND 1 BY THE LAMB, THE MANNA, THE ARK,
[81]  Ephesians 3:17-18: That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are.
[82]  Deuteronomy 12:10: When you cross over the Jordan and dwell in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance, and when He gives you rest from all your enemies surrounding you so that you dwell securely.
[83]  At the very beginning, the people of Israel enjoyed the lamb of the passover Exo 12 , which we know was the type of Christ 1 Cor 5:7 .
[84]  While they were still in the land of Egypt, they enjoyed Christ.
[85]  Yet the land of Canaan is also a type of Christ.
[86]  The lamb is Christ, and the land also is Christ.
[87]  Seemingly, then, there are two Christs: a smaller Christ and a larger Christ, a Christ as small as the passover lamb and a Christ as great as the land of Canaan.
[88]  It seems that while we are enjoying this little Christ, a greater Christ is still awaiting us, and we must press on to this goal to enjoy such a One.
[89]  I had something already, for I had this Christ, but on the other hand, I still had to press on to obtain Him.
[90]  At the moment you were saved, whether you were aware of it or not, you experienced Christ as two kinds of lives: you experienced Him as the redeeming lamb as well as the generating and multiplying life.
[91]  To enjoy Christ, starting from the lamb of the passover and continuing day by day with the manna from heaven, is just the beginning.
[92]  We must go on to experience Him as the Ark, the Ark embodied and covered with the tabernacle Exo 25:10-22 .
[93]  You should do this and you should do that; you should not do this and you should not do that.
[94]  As we enjoy Christ as the lamb of the passover and as our daily manna, we must also have this Christ, this larger Christ if you would allow me to use this word , as our center.
[95]  Under the seal skin is the rams skin dyed red, signifying that Christ died and shed His blood for our sins, and under that is the covering of goats hair, signifying that Christ was made sin for us.
[96]  The innermost layer is the glorious Christ; the second is the Christ who was made sin for us; the third is the Christ who died, shedding His blood; and the fourth, the outermost covering, is the Christ who humbled Himself to become a lowly man.
[97]  We must have this tabernacle, this embodiment of the Ark. We must be bound together in this divine nature as the tabernacle to the Ark. The Ark, which is Christ, is within as our center, and we are the enlargement of this Christ as the tabernacle embodying the Ark.
[98]  CHAPTER TEN HOW TO POSSESS THE LAND 2 BY THE OFFERINGS AND THE PRIESTHOOD Scripture Reading: Lev 1:1-3; 2:1; 3:1; 4:2, 3; 5:5, 6; 8:1-13; Exo 40:17, 21
[99]  We have begun to see the way to enter the land and take possession of the all-inclusive Christ.
[100]  We have pointed out that if we would possess such a One, we must begin by enjoying Him little by little.
[101]  The people of Israel began to enjoy the types of Christ with the lamb of the passover that is the place where we all must start.
[102]  All these are types of Christ, but they are elementary types; they are not so deep and rich.
[103]  Much more of Christ is manifested by the Ark. In the lamb of the passover, you may realize Christ only as the redeeming One, the One who died on the cross, shedding His blood for our sins.
[104]  If we would take possession of the all-inclusive Christ, we must have such a Christ as our center, a Christ with the testimony in Himself, a Christ who is the manifestation and the explanation of God.
[105]  And we must be the enlargement of this Christ, the tabernacle for this Christ, the expression of this Christ.
[106]  When we have the Ark as our center and we are built together as the tabernacle to embody this Ark, then the glory of God comes down and fills the tabernacle.
[107]  It is not until we have this testimony, until we experience Christ as the Ark, as the manifestation of God, and until we are the expression of the Ark, the enlargement of Christ, that we are filled with the glory of God.
[108]  He is the expression of God, and we must be the expression of Him.
[109]  When the point is reached where we have such a Christ as the manifestation of God and we are the expression of such a Christ, the glory of God will fill us whenever we come together.
[110]  It is neither the little passover lamb, nor even Christ as the daily manna and the rock, but Christ, the manifestation of God among us as the center, mingled with us, enlarged within us, and increased among us.
[111]  We started with Exodus 12 by enjoying Christ as the redeeming lamb; we have also seen what it means to go on and enjoy Him as the daily manna and as the rock flowing with the living water; and we have seen the enjoyment of Christ as the Ark, as the manifestation of the living God, and us as the expression, the enlargement of this Christ, so that the glory of God fills us.
[112]  Whenever we would deal with the testimony, whenever we would contact the expression of Christ, we must offer Christ once more, we must apply Christ once more.
[113]  We have to experience Christ and apply Christ hour by hour, instance by instance, in such a way that we will be qualified, enabled, and strengthened to go on and take possession of the all-inclusive Christ.
[114]  Immediately after the offerings in the first part of Leviticus, we are introduced to the priesthood.
[115]  Aaron and his sons were all adorned and qualified to serve as priests to God.
[116]  We must have this; we must have Christ as our Aaron, Christ as our high priest, and all of us must be His sons, the priests to serve the Lord.
[117]  When you come to the meeting to enjoy the Lord, do you serve, do you function, do you minister?
[118]  But if you tell me that you are not a minister, I will tell you that I am not a minister either.
[119]  They are those who are living in Christ and by Christ to manifest Christ.
[120]  The essential and basic thing is that you live in Christ, walk in Christ, enjoy Christ, experience Christ, and apply Christ to all your life.
[121]  What the priests eat represents Christ, what they wear represents Christ, and all their living represents Christ.
[122]  When you teach in school, you teach in Christ; when you do business, you do business in Christ; when you take care of your home, you do it in Christ.
[123]  Whether you clean or arrange the seats or kneel down with two or three other sisters to pray for the meeting, it is all a ministry, a ministry fulfilled in Christ, with Christ, and by Christ.
[124]  But they were serving the Lord in Christ; they were living in Christ, with Christ, and by Christ.
[125]  It all depends on how much you live in Christ, walk in Christ, and take Christ as your food, your clothing, and your everything.
[126]  HOW TO POSSESS THE LAND 3 BY THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLES Scripture Reading: Exo 40:36-38; Lev 8:7, 8, 10-12, 30; 20:26; 26:46
[127]  Before going on to Numbers, we must see something more in the two books of Exodus and Leviticus.
[128]  We have seen that the way to enter the good land is by enjoying Christ step by step in an ever increasing measure, starting from the lamb of the passover.
[129]  We have seen that to possess the good land, to enter into the all-inclusiveness of Christ, cannot be accomplished by an individual person but only by a collective people.
[130]  When we have fellowship with the Lord, when we commune with the Lord day by day and moment by moment, and when in this living fellowship we live, we serve, and we act, we are a priesthood.
[131]  The third governing factor is the regulations of a holy life.
[132]  First, remember that you are the Lord s children; second, remember that you have been separated from this world; third, remember that your God is a holy God and you must be just as holy as He.
[133]  HOW TO POSSESS THE LAND 4 BY THE FORMATION OF THE ARMY Scripture Reading: Num 1:1-4, 17, 18, 52, 53; 2:1, 2; 4:3; 8:23-26; 26:1, 2, 52-56, 63-65
[134]  We have seen many things regarding the entering of the good land.
[135]  They are all related to the enjoyment of Christ, starting with the enjoyment of Him as the passover lamb to the enjoyment of Him as the Ark enlarged with the tabernacle, including the offerings and the priesthood.
[136]  Do you really experience Christ as the manifestation and the explanation of God in a solid way, as well as the expansion of Christ, the tabernacle, as His real expression among you?
[137]  Pray that the Lord will reveal to you and cause you to experience Christ, the very testimony of God, as your center as well as the church, the enlargement of Himself, as His expression.
[138]  Then, following the priesthood, we need the formation of the army.
[139]  By the assuming of the priesthood, we can be formed into a spiritual army to fight for the Lord s interest on this earth.
[140]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN HOW TO POSSESS THE LAND 5 THE OPPOSING FACTORS Scripture Reading: Lev 10:1-3; Num 12:1, 2, 9, 10, 15; 13:2 14:10; 16:1-3, 12-14; 21:5, 6; 25:1-5; 26:63-65; 1 Cor 10:1-6; Heb 4:11
[141]  In this chapter we will see how to possess the land from the negative aspect instead of from the positive.
[142]  We have seen that the way for the Lord s people to possess the good land is in a group, not as single persons.
[143]  If we as a group of the Lord s people would go on to enjoy Christ in a more solid way than the redeeming lamb and the daily manna, if we would enjoy Him as the testimony of God, we must be built up together into one body as the tabernacle under the cover of the fullness of Christ.
[144]  As such, we can receive Christ as our Redeemer, we can enjoy Him a little day by day as the manna, and we can even enjoy Him as the rock flowing with the living stream indeed, as individuals we may enjoy Christ to this extent.
[145]  In order to maintain the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the army, besides individualism we must be exceedingly careful to avoid the following things; they will do great damage.
[146]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN ENTERING THE GOOD LAND Scripture Reading: Josh 1:1-6; 4:1-3, 8, 9; 5:2, 7-9, 10-12, 13-15; 6:1-11, 15, 16, 20; Col 2:12; 3:1-5; Eph 6:12, 13; 2 Cor 10:3-5
[147]  Now we are ready to enter the good land.
[148]  We have enjoyed the passover lamb in Egypt, we have left Egypt and crossed the Red Sea, we have enjoyed Christ as the daily manna and as the rock with the flowing stream, and we have experienced Christ as the Ark, the testimony of God.
[149]  We have enjoyed Christ, we have possessed Christ, and we have Christ there is no doubt about it.
[150]  Now, because we have experienced Christ so much, because we have Christ as the center of God s testimony and have been built up into the tabernacle as the expression of Christ, because we have the priesthood and the army of God and are ready to take possession of the land, God tells us to make a memorial, reminding us that we have been buried.
[151]  Third, believing that we have been crucified with Christ and that we have been buried, we must apply this death to ourselves.
[152]  This is the application of the death of Christ to our flesh.
[153]  If we realize that we are buried with Christ and raised with Christ, we must put our flesh to death; we must apply the death of Christ to our fleshly members.
[154]  We must daily take the ground that we are dead and buried and apply the death of Christ to our members.
[155]  In the second chapter of Colossians we are told that we have been buried and raised with Christ and then in chapter three that our life is now hid with Christ in God.
[156]  Sometimes you enjoy Christ as the manna, and sometimes, it seems, you enjoy Christ as the produce of the land.
[157]  Take the ground of resurrection, remembering that you are buried; apply the death of Christ to all your earthly members; enjoy Christ with the saints in the way of all-inclusiveness and declare and testify in faith all that the Lord is.
[158]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN LIFE IN THE LAND Scripture Reading: Deut 12:1-18, 20-21, 26-27; 14:22-23; 16:16-17
[159]  Suppose that we have already taken possession of the land.
[160]  We have entered into it, we have defeated and subdued all the enemies, and we are living in it.
[161]  Now we must discover what manner of life we should have in the land.
[162]  We must not only know how to take possession of the all-inclusiveness of Christ, but also after possessing Him how to live a life in the eyes of God that will enable us to enjoy Him.
[163]  There are many kinds of industries in the world, but we who are the Lord s people living in the all-inclusive Christ should have one industry Christ.
[164]  To worship God with Christ does not mean to worship Him individually but to worship Him collectively with all the children of God by enjoying Christ with one another and with God.
[165]  We have seen briefly our need to work upon Christ and make Christ our industry.
[166]  I believe we are clear regarding this matter, but I am afraid it may be merely a doctrine to many.
[167]  What must we do to work on Christ daily?
[168]  Every morning you need to pray: Lord, I consecrate myself once more to You, not to work for You but to enjoy You.
[169]  When the Lord s Day comes and you go to worship the Lord with the saints, you will be able to say, I am going now to see my God; I am going to worship my Lord.
[170]  You can give him a little of the produce from the Christ upon whom you have been laboring, the Christ whom you have been enjoying day by day.
[171]  We are meeting together to have an exhibition of Christ, not just the Christ God gave us but the Christ we have produced, the Christ upon whom we have labored and whom we have experienced.
[172]  The worship of His people is when everyone is full of Christ, radiant with Christ, and exhibiting the Christ upon whom they have labored and whom they have produced.
[173]  It is a life of working on Christ, producing Christ, enjoying Christ, sharing Christ with others, and offering Christ to God that He may enjoy Him with us.
[174]  It is a Christ who is labored upon by us, a Christ who is produced by us, a Christ who is enjoyed by us, a Christ who is shared with others and offered to God by us.
[175]  According to the book of Deuteronomy there are two ways set forth for enjoying Christ.
[176]  But if we would enjoy Christ in a collective way with the Lord s children, we have no choice; there is only one place to which we can go.
[177]  But if we would enjoy Christ with the Lord s people as worship to God, we must go to the very place chosen by God.
[178]  And there you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; and there you shall eat before Jehovah your God...You shall not do according to all that we do here today, each man doing all that is right in his own eyes.
[179]  On one hand, you have full liberty to enjoy Christ by yourself wherever you are, but when you gather with the Lord s children to worship Him you have lost your liberty.
[180]  The other rule is that if you would enjoy the produce of the good land together with the Lord s people before God as worship, you have no choice, you have no right to follow your own inclinations and do what is right in your eyes.
[181]  THE TEMPLE AND THE CITY Scripture Reading: Deut 12:5-7, 17-18; 8:7-9; Eph 1:22-23; 2:19-22
[182]  We have seen much concerning the experience of Christ.
[183]  We have begun with the lamb of the passover and passed through many different items such as the daily manna, the cleft rock with the flowing stream, the Ark of the Testimony with its enlargement, the tabernacle, all the various offerings, the priests with the priesthood, and the holy army.
[184]  The passover lamb as a type of Christ is indeed complete and perfect, yet it is a type of Christ on a much smaller scale.
[185]  When we come to the Lord and accept Him as our Redeemer, the Christ we receive is whole, complete, and perfect, but as far as our experience of Him is concerned, we experience Him only on a small scale, just as a little lamb.
[186]  From the time we experienced Christ as the lamb, we have always been progressing and advancing; we have continually made improvement in our experience of Christ and have enjoyed Him more and more.
[187]  The more we work on Christ, the more we will produce of Christ, the more we will enjoy Christ, the more we will have of Christ to share with others, and the more we can offer Christ to God.
[188]  We must notice again that all the people of Israel brought their produce to one place, to the place chosen by God, to worship God and to enjoy the produce before God and with God.
[189]  What they produced, typically speaking, was Christ, and what they offered to God was Christ.
[190]  What they produced they offered to God to enjoy mutually before Him and with Him.
[191]  Brothers and sisters, every time we come together to worship God in Christ, with Christ, and through Christ, we are offering Christ as the peace offering.
[192]  You must bring Christ to this central point; I must bring Christ to this central point; we all must bring Christ to this central place, there to mutually enjoy Him before God and with God.
[193]  If we are those who enjoy Christ as the good land to such an extent that we come together upon the ground of unity to enjoy Him mutually with God, we will be the proper church.
[194]  Christ is what they eat, Christ is what they drink Christ is everything to them.
[195]  A Christian is one who day by day is eating Christ, drinking Christ, digesting Christ, becoming mingled with Christ.
[196]  When they meet together, they offer Christ to God, they enjoy Christ together, and they exhibit Christ.
[197]  It is a group of people mingled with Christ, saturated with Christ, enjoying Christ day by day, and coming together with nothing but Christ.
[198]  It is enlarged by Christ as the authority of God.
[199]  We not only need Christ as our enjoyment but Christ as the authority of God.
[200]  When you and I enjoy Christ together in the way that we have shown, the reality of the authority of Christ is among us.
[201]  May we be faithful to Him and learn by His grace how to enjoy Christ, how to experience Christ, and how to apply Christ to our daily lives.
