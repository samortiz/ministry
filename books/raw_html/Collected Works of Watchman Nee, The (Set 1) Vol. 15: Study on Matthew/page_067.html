<P>Verse 8:"If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire." How can a person not be stumbled? First he should mind himself. If he will not stumble, others will not be stumbled by him. If he is stumbled, others also will be stumbled because of him. (If you gamble, others will be stumbled, and they will gamble as well or will begin to despise Christ.) If the conduct of your hand and the action of your foot cause you to stumble, you should rather pay the greatest price to cut them off. If you retain them, you will stumble others. If one keeps himself from any acts of stumbling, he will not be touched by the eternal fire, though such fire is eternal.</P><P>Verse 9:"And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire." The "eye" here refers to the lust of the eye. Those who lust after a woman by looking at her (see the interpretation in Matthew 5:27-30) should pay the price to cut such conduct off. There are two reasons for stumbling: (1) a person is stumbled in himself; (2) a person despises others. Therefore, in order for one not to stumble others, he must not be stumbled himself, and he must not despise others.</P><P>Verse 10:"See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of My Father who is in the heavens." We should not despise anyone but should treasure their souls. The "little ones" refers to those who are worthless materially or physically. The "angels" are the "ministering spirits" (Heb. 1:14) (Scofield, Kelly, and other Brethren groups all said that the "angels" here refer to man's spirit (Acts 12:15). If that is the case, unless the little child dies, how can he always behold the face of the heavenly Father?) On the ladder the angels are ascending and descending (John 1:51). They ascend with prayers and descend with gifts. Therefore, we should not allow our angels to become idle. Today we have the Holy Spirit in our hearts; hence, the ministering of the angels is rarely seen.</P><P>Verse 11:"For the Son of Man has come to save that which is lost." Not only do their angels always behold the face of the Father in heaven, but the Lord's coming is to save them also. Therefore, we should not despise the little ones.</P><P>Verses 12-13:"What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and seek the one that has gone astray? And if it so happens that he finds it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray." The explanation of this parable is similar to that of the parable in Luke 15:1-7, but the implications are different. The parable in the Gospel of Luke tells sinners the matter of salvation. Here it tells saved believers the intention of salvation. "Any man" refers to the Lord Jesus. The Lord does not want to lose any believer. "Goes astray." A sheep is naturally dumb; if it goes astray, it cannot return (see Isa. 53:6). "Ninety-nine which have not gone astray." This is only an assumption; it surely does not refer to the righteous man, because there is not one righteous man in the world. "Go." This means that the Lord went Himself. He did not entrust this work to the angels. The Good Shepherd is willing to give His life for the sheep.</P><P>Verse 14:"In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones perish." Even so, the heart of the heavenly Father is unwilling that one of these little ones should perish. How can we offend others or cause others to perish? God takes pleasure in salvation. Although believers on the earth cannot enjoy the pleasure of this world, they should seek for their joy through saving others. Since the Lord is not willing to lose a little sheep, and since God rejoices in granting salvation to others, believers should not stumble others. But if a person sins and offends you, what should you do? We need to consider verse 15.</P><P>Verse 15:"Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother." We should still have a heart to recover such a one, as we would in saving a lost sheep. In this verse the Lord did not correct the wrong and sinning brothers, but He corrected those who are not wrong. Every time a man corrects others, he should realize that he also is in the wrong. Therefore, it is easy to deal with a righteous person, but it is difficult to deal with an evil person. It is easy for men to deal with proper things having an improper attitude. Moses failed in this point; the Israelites erred, but Moses dealt with such a proper matter with improper words. Do not become wrong just because others are wrong. Do not help others and in the process become one who needs help yourself. If you do, you also will fall into sin. When that happens, the only difference between you and them will be a matter of time—one sins sooner and the other sins later. "Between you and him alone." This is with no other people present; this means that one should hide evils. "Reprove him." This is not to demonstrate one's prowess or dignity, nor to rebuke; rather, this is humility, which is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens. If you rebuke such a brother, you consider yourself better than he. That is the self-boasting of the Pharisees (Luke 18:11). "You have gained your brother." The purpose of a rebuke is to turn others through love.</P><P>Verses 16-17:"But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector." "If he does not hear you." You must exhaust all means—the testimony of two or three witnesses, the arbitration of the church—before you can deem him (1) a Gentile, with whom you cannot associate, and (2) a tax collector, who is despicable. (There is no need to excommunicate this kind of person, because most of their sins involve merely being too strong in the will. However, if a person sins as in 1 Corinthians 5:11, he needs to be put away immediately.)</P>
