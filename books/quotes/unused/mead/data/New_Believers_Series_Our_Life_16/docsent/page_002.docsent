   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR TO ME, TO LIVE IS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are many Christians who have greatly misunderstood Philippians 1:21.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When Paul said, "For to me, to live is Christ," he was stating a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They think for to me, to live is Christ is a goal or a hope.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But Paul did not say that his goal was to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul was saying, "I live because I have Christ; I cannot live without Him."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was a fact in him, not a goal he was seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was the secret to his living, not the hope he was cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His living was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For him to live was for Christ to live.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Galatians 2:20 is a very familiar verse to many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But many misunderstand it more than they misunderstand Philippians 1:21.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They have made Galatians 2:20 their goal, praying with aspiration and hoping they will reach the state when "it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Each time this verse is read, they are full of aspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people pray, fast, and hope that one day they will be crucified with Christ and reach the state when "it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Galatians 2:20 has become their goal and their hope.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to our experience, no one with such a hope ever reaches his goal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you make it your goal and hope to attain such a state, if you aspire to be crucified, that is, to no longer be the one who lives but instead to have Christ living in you, you will wait forever before seeing your aspiration fulfilled, because you are hoping for something that is impossible to achieve.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has given us a wonderful gift of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who fail can overcome; those who are unclean can be clean; those who are worldly can be holy; those who are earthly can be heavenly; and those who are carnal can be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not a goal, but a way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This way lies in the life of substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just as we found a vicarious death in the Lord's grace, we also can find a vicarious living in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the cross the Lord bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through His death we were spared death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our sins were forgiven, and we were spared judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Similarly, Paul tells us that we are spared of our living through the Lord living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The implication is simple: Since He lives in us, we no longer need to live.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Just as He died once for us on the cross, today He is living for us and in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul did not say, "I hope that I will not live.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that I will allow Him to live."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, he was saying, "I no longer live anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the One who is living."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the secret to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the way to be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The day we heard that we did not need to die, we embraced that word as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Similarly, it should also be a day of the gospel to us when we hear that we do not need to live.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that the new believers will pray much for God's enlightenment and will see that Christ lives in us and that we no longer need to live by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Unless we see this, maintaining a testimony or living the Christian life is a great burden.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is a great burden to fight temptation, to bear the cross, or to obey God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many believers feel that it is very hard to maintain the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Daily they try, yet daily they sigh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Daily they struggle, yet daily they fail.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every day they try to maintain their testimony, yet every day they bring shame to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many people do not have the strength to reject sin, yet they feel guilty when they do not reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They feel condemned when they lose their temper, yet they cannot be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They feel sorry for hating others, yet they have no strength to love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people are exhausted from trying to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They feel that the Christian life is like climbing a hill with a heavy burden on their back; they can never reach the top.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before they were saved, they had the burden of sin on their back.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now that they have believed in the Lord, they have the burden of holiness on their back.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They exchange one burden for another, and the new one is just as tiresome and burdensome as the old one.</S>
