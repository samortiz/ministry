   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BIBLE BEING THE EMBODIMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF GOD THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit, however, is very abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is as abstract as the radio waves in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is hard for man to touch Him or to understand Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Bible is the embodiment of this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus said in John 6:63 that the words He speaks are spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows us that God s word is the embodiment of God s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is like a radio receiver capturing the radio waves in the air; the radio receiver becomes the embodiment of the radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the radio waves are in the air, we neither hear, touch, nor understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As soon as they are captured by the receiver, the radio waves become manifested before us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What was abstract becomes real.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can feel it, hear it, and understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, we can say that the radio receiver is the embodiment of the radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same principle, if there were only God the Spirit in the universe and there were no Bible, God to us would be the same as the radio waves; we would not be able to grasp Him or find Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But thank God that His word is here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This word is the embodiment of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God the Spirit is contained in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why the Lord Jesus said that His word is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the same way, we can say the word in the Bible is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To put this in a clearer way, we can say that the Bible is the embodiment of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. The Expression of God the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, the Bible is the embodiment of God the Spirit; it is also the expression of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God the Spirit is expressed through the Bible as the embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since the day you heard the gospel until now, how many times have you been moved by the Holy Spirit apart from God s word?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Probably very little.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Almost every time we are moved by the Holy Spirit, it is through God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Never does the Holy Spirit urge us apart from the word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes, it is through a verse you have read in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes, it is through your remembrance of a verse you have read.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes, it is through some words that match the Bible in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These are all words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although you are moved by the Holy Spirit, it is hard to separate the Holy Spirit from the word in these cases.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is hard for you to say whether you are moved by the word or by the Holy Spirit, because at such times the Holy Spirit is in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word is the embodiment and the expression of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of course, we admit that many times we can have the word without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is like having a radio receiver without the radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Surely, this is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We admit that many people read God s Word in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But there are also many times when we just open up the Lord s Word a little and the Holy Spirit comes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Holy Spirit is in the word, and the word is the expression of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At any rate, it is hard for us to be moved by the Holy Spirit without God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To put it in another way, seldom are we moved by the word without the moving of the Holy Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Under normal circumstances, one cannot separate God the Spirit from the Bible, since the Bible is the embodiment and the expression of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>B. The Dwelling Place of God the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible as the embodiment of God the Spirit is not only His expression, but also His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God the Spirit resides in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From our experience, we know this is true.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many times, when we read the Bible, we touch God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is because the Bible is the dwelling place of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is the place where God the Spirit resides.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>C. The Means of God the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is another point.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Bible is the means of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whatever He does to us is through the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whatever God does toward us and whatever God wants us to do are done through His word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The word is the embodiment of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, it is also the expression, the dwelling place, and the means of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Under normal circumstances, whenever we touch the word in the Bible, we should receive, touch, and feel the moving of God the Spirit and should contact God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Bible is God s word, God s revelation, God s breathing out, and the embodiment of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>V. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BIBLE A. Testifying Concerning the Lord Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The first function of the Bible is to testify concerning the Lord Jesus John 5:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord Jesus is the subject and contents of the Bible; the Bible is the explanation and expression of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus is God s living Word; the Bible is God s written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Bible, God s written Word, must have the Lord Jesus, the living Word, as its reality; otherwise, it is but mere doctrines and empty letters.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord Jesus, the living Word, must have the Bible, the written Word, as His expression; otherwise, He is mysterious and difficult to know, vague and hard to grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, since there is the clear, definite explanation and plain revelation of the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus can be known practically and comprehended definitely by men.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not only every book of the New Testament reveals the Lord Jesus, but every part of the Old Testament, whether 1 the Law of Moses, 2 the Prophets, or 3 the Psalms these are the three major parts of the Old Testament , testifies and speaks concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, if we want to know the Lord Jesus, we must read and understand the Bible.</S>
