   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>10 For God's Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have been selected and called for God's purpose Rom 9:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not many Christians know what this purpose is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was young, I heard message after message and read book after book about Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those messages and books spoke of justification by faith and of Abraham's being the father of faith, but none of them ever said that God called Abraham with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Abraham, we cannot see this purpose, because he had no maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not see the beginning of the experience of God in Abraham; neither do we see the adequate ending of the proper life in his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suddenly, as Abraham was living in Chaldea, God shined upon him and he was "hooked."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God called Abraham, and he was caught.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the genuine beginning did not start in Chaldea; it started with God's selection before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This beginning is found in Jacob, not in Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have seen that Abraham's life ended with a second marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After he had become so old, he married again and brought forth six sons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This certainly is not the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not see that Abraham was transformed into a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would see the beginning and ending of the experience of God, we must come to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jacob's experience of God began in eternity past and will last until eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the purpose of God's calling?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is to transform His called ones into kings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can see this purpose in Jacob, but not in Abraham or Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Isaac only knew to eat "savory meat."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you were to ask Isaac about his purpose in life, he might have said, "My purpose in life is to enjoy."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Isaac did not know anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In like manner, most Christians today do not know what the purpose of their life is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They may say, "We have been saved to live a happy life, to have peace and joy today, and to go to heaven in the future."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the New Testament clearly reveals that the purpose of God's selection, predestination, and calling is sonship Eph 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have been predestinated unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are not common sons; we are royal sons, sons of the royal family who are destined to be kings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Romans 8:29 says, "Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's purpose in selecting, predestinating, and calling us is to make pitiful sinners into royal sons so that, after the process of transformation has been completed, we may reign as kings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Genesis 1:26 reveals that God's purpose in His creation of man was that man might express Him in His image and represent Him with His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The New Testament also says that we have been made priests and kings Rev 1:6; 20:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As priests, we bear the image of God to express Him, and as kings, we have the dominion of God to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the millennial kingdom, we shall express Him in His image as His priests and we shall exercise His dominion with His authority to rule over the earth as kings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now, we are daily undergoing the process of transformation that we might bear the full image of God and exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we look at ourselves, we shall say, "The more I look at myself, the less I look like a son of God, much less like a king.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How pitiful I am!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although I have been saved for many years, I'm still so poor."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Praise the Lord that we realize that we are so poor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not be disappointed or discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why we are under the process of God's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Of the fifty chapters in the book of Genesis, twenty-five and a half are devoted to the record of Jacob with Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In these chapters we see that Jacob was under God's dealings and discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everyone who was involved with or related to Jacob became a means whereby God dealt with him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God used his father, mother, brother, uncle, wives, and children.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when Jacob finally came out of the oven, he became a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What was the purpose of Jacob's experience?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Was it for him to have peace, joy, and a happy life?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we say this, Jacob would reply, "I don't agree with you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In my whole life I have not had much peace, not even when I was in my mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God did not put me first; I had to fight for it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And when I lost the fight, I had no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I cheated my brother, and he wanted to kill me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then my mother helped me to flee to my uncle Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Laban was much more skillful than I in cheating.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Don't talk to me about peace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I haven't had much peace or joy, but I've had many dealings."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's purpose for Jacob was not to give him peace, joy, and a happy life and then to take him to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's purpose was to deal with this pitiful supplanter until he was transformed into a prince of God bearing His image to express Him and exercising His dominion to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we come to the end of Genesis, we see that Israel was exactly this type of person.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When he saw Pharaoh, he did not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He simply stretched forth his hands and blessed him 47:7, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Jacob bore the image of God, expressing Him in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Furthermore, through Joseph, he was the one who had dominion over the whole earth, representing God on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, at the end of Genesis we see God's goal, the goal of His selection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today we are on the way of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have all been called, justified, and are enjoying God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At the same time, we are under God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Not only is God's little finger upon us, but also His thumb.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is God's dealing and God's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This will make us not only a son of God, but also an Israel, a prince of God.</S>
