        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">MAN&rsquo;S FALL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:15; Ezek. 28:12-17; Isa. 14:12-15; Gen. 2:16-17; 3:1-7, 22-24; Rom. 5:12-19; 1 Cor. 15:22</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters we saw God&rsquo;s plan and creation. In this chapter we will consider man&rsquo;s fall. In order to understand man&rsquo;s fall, we must first consider Satan, who tempted man and caused man to fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXISTENCE OF SATAN</h2>
<p>After creating man, God put Adam in the garden of Eden &ldquo;to work it and to keep it&rdquo; (Gen. 2:15). God commanded Adam not only to work the garden but also to keep it. In Hebrew the word <em>keep</em> means &ldquo;to guard.&rdquo; The fact that God commanded Adam to guard the garden of Eden shows that there was someone in the universe seeking to destroy God&rsquo;s creation. If there were no one seeking to destroy God&rsquo;s creation, God would not have commanded Adam to guard the garden. Thus, God commanded Adam to guard the garden because Satan was seeking to destroy God&rsquo;s creation. Before man was created, Satan was in conflict with God and intent upon destroying God&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that Satan was in conflict with God before man was created and before God restored the heavens and the earth (1:1-2; Ezek. 28:12-17). Satan rebelled against God and became the adversary of God. After God restored all things, He commanded Adam to guard the garden because Satan, as God&rsquo;s enemy, was seeking to damage His restored creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN OF SATAN</h2>
<p>According to Ezekiel 28, Satan was initially the anointed cherub; however, he sinned and rebelled against God. This occurred in the world that existed before man was created. Verses 13 through 16 of chapter 28 say, &ldquo;You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering...The workmanship of your tambourines and your pipes was prepared with you on the day that you were created. You were the anointed cherub who covered the Ark; indeed I set you, so that you were upon the holy mountain of God...You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you. By the abundance of your trading they filled your midst with violence, and you sinned. So I cast you out as profane from the mountain of God.&rdquo; Satan was initially the anointed cherub. As the anointed cherub, he was associated with God&rsquo;s glory (v. 14; 9:3), and he was very close to God (1 Sam. 4:4). Satan was in the garden of God and upon the holy mountain of God; thus, he was very close to God (Ezek. 28:13-14). Satan was not only a cherub for God&rsquo;s glory and very close to God; he also sealed up perfection, was full of wisdom, and was perfect in beauty (v. 12). Judging from the fact that the workmanship of tambourines and pipes was prepared with him on the day that he was created (v. 13), he must have been like a great king (cf. Dan. 3:5). He was &ldquo;the anointed cherub who covered the Ark&rdquo; (Ezek. 28:14). He was anointed to cover the Ark, that is, to guard and protect the interest of God.</p>
<p>Other portions in the Bible show that the world now is under Satan&rsquo;s rule (Luke 4:5-6; Eph. 2:2; John 12:31). Satan must have been a ruler among the angels (Ezek. 28:13-14), an archangel with a high position (cf. Jude 9). Even though he was perfect in his ways, he sinned against God because his heart was lifted up by his beauty (Ezek. 28:15, 17-18). Isaiah 14:13-14 reveals that Satan&rsquo;s sin was to uplift himself to be equal to God. Satan said in his heart, &ldquo;I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne. / And I will sit upon the mount of assembly / In the uttermost parts of the north. / I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will make myself like the Most High.&rdquo; Initially, he was for God&rsquo;s glory, but he tried to usurp God&rsquo;s glory. Satan was anointed to protect God&rsquo;s interest, but he tried to usurp God&rsquo;s place. Thus, he became God&rsquo;s adversary. The Hebrew word for <em>Satan</em> means &ldquo;adversary.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DESTRUCTION OF SATAN</h2>
<p>After this anointed cherub rebelled against God and became Satan, God condemned him and cast him out from His holy mountain (Ezek. 28:16). Although Satan was condemned and cast out from God&rsquo;s presence, the Bible reveals that God does not want to destroy Satan directly. God wants to deal with and destroy Satan through man. Although Satan was cast out from God&rsquo;s presence, God allows him to exist while He gains man, who will destroy him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TREE<br />
OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</h2>
<p>God put Adam in front of the tree of life, which signifies the life of God, so that he would contact the tree of life in order to receive God&rsquo;s life. God wants to give us His life, but Satan wants to give us death. This is the significance of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil being next to the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9). The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan. Satan has the might of death (Heb. 2:14); therefore, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil brings death to man. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil reveals that in the universe there is not only God but also Satan. God gives life to man, but Satan gives death to man. It is possible for man to contact God and receive life, and it is also possible for man to contact Satan and receive death. When man contacts the tree of life, he contacts God, and the issue is life. When man contacts the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he contacts Satan, and the issue is death.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
