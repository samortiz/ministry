   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Footsteps of Brothers Hu and Hsu,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Yunnan Province Intending to Go up Nu River into Sikang One</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As tender shoots in a thorny land, we can only trust in the power of God and go on in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today is our happiest day because the days of trials, of "tending sheep in the land of the Midians" have been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many difficulties are behind us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank the Lord who loves us, who has given us the same mind, the same hope, and the same footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Tomorrow we will go upstream along the Nu River and enter Tibet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>May the Father bless His testimony, and may glory be to His holy name.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We wish that the dear brothers and sisters would offer up a special prayer for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hu Yi-min, the night before departure</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother Hu and I have decided to set out on August 22 to cross the Lan-Chang River, climb Nu Mountain, and go up Nu River into Sikang, preaching the gospel along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May the Lord bless our work this time, and may He glorify His own name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We ask that the brothers and sisters pray much for us!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This trip will take us two months.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord willing, I will send my wife to live in K'un-ming when I return.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I heard that Ah-Dun-Tze was attacked by robbers on August 12 and that everything was ransacked.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This has closed that way into Sikang; therefore, we can only go up the Nu River.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, August 19</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Temporarily Stopping at Nu River One</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot thank the Lord enough for bringing us safely to Nu River.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We stayed here for more than twenty days, working in the areas where Brother Hu used to work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I heard that there are over a thousand Li-Suh believers in this part of Nu River, meeting in over ten places.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These Li-Suh natives have asked us to preach to them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thank the Lord that we have found ready ears when we preach.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps some will receive God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Hu and I had intended to enter Tibet and then Sikang, but the way to Tibet is closed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one is allowed to go through it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have been stopped from advancing any further.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The situation in Ah-Dun-Tze is very unstable, and it was impossible to take that way either.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can only preach in Nu River.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We will come down from Hwang-Shan to the Shang-Po region, having heard that many areas around there have never heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We will work there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In two weeks I will have to return to Yeh-Ji.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After my return I will send my wife to K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord has opened the door at Nu River, and we intend to look for a place to do some serious work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May the Lord's will be accomplished, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, on Na-Ou Mountain at Nu River</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>September 15</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have been at Nu River for about a month already.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Nu tribes and the Li-Suh natives desire the Lord's truth very much.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Unfortunately, there is no one to preach the real gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But now the Lord has opened their eyes a little.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thank the Lord that some have understood the truth of eternal life and of the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are many places in this area that have never heard the gospel before.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We intend to work in these places.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Hu is still at Nu River and will return in approximately three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Presently, I am getting the luggage ready and preparing to send my wife and children to K'un-ming.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord willing, after I settle them in K'un-ming, I will return and enter the Nu River or the Chu-Tze River before the snow blocks the mountain way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I heard that many Chu-Tze natives have believed in the Lord, and the preachers are Li-Suh natives and Nu natives.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The only ones who have been to these places were some Westerners from the Assembly of God Church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are still many places that have never heard the gospel before.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord has prepared one or two people who know the Li-Suh language well.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One is a Han Chinese, and the other is a Li-Suh native.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Both of them have implored me to stay at Nu River and Chu-Tze River to preach the gospel there.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It seems that we cannot go into Sikang for now.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Perhaps the door of the work has not opened yet.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The disturbance in Ah-Dun-Tze is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can only commit our future to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we can set out on the third of October, we can arrive in K'un-ming on October 21 or 22.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brother Hsu Jung-jieh, September 30</S>
