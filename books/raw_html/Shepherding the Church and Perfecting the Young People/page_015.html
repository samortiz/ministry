	 <h2 class="head1">CHANGING OUR CONCEPT<br />
AND LEARNING TO TEACH OTHERS</h2>
<p>There are different ways to teach. For example, a Chinese mother teaches her child in a way that is different from an American mother. I know a Chinese family with three daughters. Because the mother felt that none of her daughters knew how to do house chores, she did all the chores. American families are different. From an early age the children learn to do chores. As soon as a child learns to walk, his parents teach him to do chores. From generation to generation they have taught their children in this way. Chinese parents do not know how to teach their children, because they themselves were not taught. In the United States children do chores from their youth. The children are taught to bring in the newspaper. As the children grow older, they are taught to water the flowers. Initially, the children may make a mess in the garden. After a few times, however, they find the proper way to water the flowers. By the time the children are seven or eight years old, they are taught to sweep the floor or to vacuum. The children are even taught how to set the table for a meal. They place napkins, plates, and knives and forks on the table. In other words, the children all have chores to do.</p>
<p>In some homes the mother has to go to work in the morning, so she leaves a note for her children, telling them what to do. For example, she tells them to wash up, eat breakfast, get dressed, and go to school. When the mother returns home in the evening, she will check to see that the children did as they were told. The children are taught in this way from an early age. Washing the dishes is another example. After dinner there are usually many dishes. The mother will prepare soapy water and let an older child wash the plates, forks, and knives. A younger child is responsible for drying them. Another child must put everything in its designated place. According to their ages, the children are assigned tasks. Every child is assigned a specific job. This saves time and is very orderly. The children do their tasks without any noise or confusion. This kind of training is very good. American parents know how to do things, and they know how to teach their children. In contrast, Chinese parents do not teach their children and often rebuke the children for making mistakes. Our work bears the same flavor. We must have a thorough turn. Beginning from the simplest things, we must teach the saints. We must have a change.</p>
<p>Some brothers said that the situation would change if we lead the saints to pray and have a revival. This method may be useful for a short time, but it will not be useful in the long run. Many Christians have revival meetings; however, after the revival, the excitement ends. Eventually, the saints still do not know how to do things. We do not have a great need for a revival, because we all love the Lord and contact Him daily. Instead of praying for a revival, we need to learn how to teach others. Our learning depends on whether we are willing to make an effort. We must learn from the American families so that we can do things and also teach others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CO-WORKERS TEACHING THE ELDERS AND PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>We need to change our concept, be willing to learn, and be patient. We need to teach others to do what we do. Then many saints will be raised up as apprentices. The first ones whom the co-workers should teach are the elders. The elders may be older and may consider themselves to be qualified and experienced, but they may also admit that they do not know how to perfect the saints. They have been meeting and discussing church affairs for many years. Nevertheless, not many elders know how to bring the saints into the service, because the elders did not learn in this way. The co-workers should teach the elders. The co-workers must spend the time to teach the elders until the elders can do things better than the co-workers, but the elders must be willing to be taught. The co-workers should teach and perfect the elders and the saints to fulfill their respective functions.</p>
<p>A local church is under the administration of the elders, and it receives teaching and shepherding from the elders. For this reason, the elders should endeavor to bear the responsibility of administrating, teaching, and shepherding. Administrating is relatively easy, but shepherding is not easy, because it includes supplying the word, visiting the saints, and contacting people. There are many things for the elders to do. Some elders are very busy with their jobs and attend numerous meetings; hence, they often have the heart but do not have the strength to shepherd the saints. Some elders are older; they are in their sixties or seventies. According to the standard in the world, this is the age for retirement. Their strength is fading, and it is not easy for them to learn new things. These are two problems: the elders who have jobs are entangled, and the elders who are older are short of energy and stamina. The elders who are between thirty and forty are able to learn new things. If we want a church to spread, we must have elders who serve full time and elders who are trained.</p>
<p>The elders need to endeavor in shepherding and teaching. We have studied the Bible many times and have found that a local church should not depend on the co-workers. The early churches relied on the elders. This is not our situation or the situation in the denominations. We rely too much on the co-workers. A family cannot depend on a professional cook to prepare its daily meals. A family depends on the parents for meals. The elders must endeavor to learn to do things, and they must also learn to teach the saints. Otherwise, we will remain in our present situation. Without the co-workers teaching the elders and the elders teaching the saints, it will be difficult for us to have a breakthrough. We must change our system and change our concept. We must teach and train the saints in order for them to be useful. Otherwise, no matter how much we preach the gospel, it will be difficult for us to gain the increase.</p>
<p>The only way out of our present situation is for the co-workers and elders to change their concept and begin teaching the saints how to do things by giving them responsibilities. Then the elders who are older will not be so tired, because they will not be required to do as much; they will teach others and delegate many things to the younger saints. This is the way that we must take. This is also the basic problem that we must resolve. The co-workers must learn how to teach others, and the elders must be willing to learn so that they also can teach others. This is the need in Taipei and also in Kaohsiung. The elders and co-workers can only do so much. We must be willing to ask the saints to come and help so that we will be able to carry out the burden of increase.</p>
