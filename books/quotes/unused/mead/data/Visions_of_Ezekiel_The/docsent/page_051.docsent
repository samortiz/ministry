   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Putting His Spirit into Their Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, the Lord said that He would put His Spirit into their spirit 36:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only would He give them a new heart and a new human spirit, He would put His own Spirit within them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not neglect our spirit because our spirit is the vessel which contains the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today, when people hear the word "spirit," they usually think of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They seldom consider that they have a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Certainly, we need the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit is now in our regenerated human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit" Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have a new heart, a new spirit, and we have the Holy Spirit within our spirit strengthening us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This enables us to keep God's commandments because His commandments are according to His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have the nature of God within us because we have His Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Something within us corresponds to God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now it is easy for us to keep the law of God because we have His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Formerly, it was very difficult for us to love people, but now it is difficult for us to hate people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Formerly, it may have been easy to steal something, but now it is difficult to steal something.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have a new nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's Spirit within us contains God's nature, and His nature corresponds to His law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Land Becoming Like the Garden of Eden</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 36:34-36, the Lord promised that the desolate and waste places would become like the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There the plant of renown, Christ as the tree of life, would be their rich supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The local churches must reach such a high condition that they are like the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even today, many times in the meetings, we have the sensation that we are in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Bringing in Flocks of Men</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the last part of Ezekiel 36 the Lord promised that He would flock people in, but that we need to inquire of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words we need to pray for the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"O Lord, flock people in. You promised this to us." In the past, whenever we prayed for an increase in number, the Lord answered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I feel we need to pray more.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord promised, yet He needs our inquiring.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He promised that He will increase our number by flocks of men, but we must pray for this and ask Him to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In all the local churches, I hope that you will pray definitely and specifically for the increase of numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Never be content with the number that you have at the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all should aspire to be doubled within a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all must pray, "Lord, flock people in!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 1963 in Los Angeles, we had only 20 to 30 people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But after we prayed for six months, the number was very much increased.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Elden Hall we also prayed that the Lord would flock people in. We prayed, "Lord, bring flocks of men to us." The Lord really heard that prayer, and I feel that today we need to pray even more.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to stand upon and claim this last part of Ezekiel 36 concerning the increase of numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not say we care nothing for numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I beg you never to say this again.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you say this, I will fight against it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I will read to you that in the Acts on one day 3,000 were brought in, and on another day 5,000 were brought in 2:41; 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Several times Acts says that "many believed" or that "the believers were multiplied" 9:42; 11:21; 14:1; 17:12; 18:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Acts 21:20 James could tell Paul that tens of thousands have believed lit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>. Do not say that numbers mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That is an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not comfort yourself in your failure.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you have failed regarding the increase, do not be comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, you have to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You must awaken to the fact that you have been in your city for years and still have only a handful of people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even to be doubled within one year is not too glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Pray about this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Claim this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some would say that we do not care for quantity; we only care for quality.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But you must realize that quality cannot come out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The quality will come out of the quantity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, we must pray for the Lord to give us the increase and to bring in flocks of men.</S>
