<P>Do we know what a covenant is? A covenant means "a bondage, a loss of freedom and self will." When God makes a covenant with us, even if He later regrets making such a covenant, I can reverently say that He cannot touch an established covenant which He has made. He has no way to change the covenant. Hallelujah! God is bound by the covenant. We will never lose the blessing of the covenant. It is not too important if we do not know, for the moment, what the new covenant is, or how much the new covenant includes. As long as we know that God has made a covenant with us, we are blessed.</P><P>What an amazing thing that God would want to make a covenant with us and would want His word to be "caught" by us. Men are always afraid that they will be "caught" by others in their words. In order to build up our faith, God is not afraid of us catching Him at His word. In fact, He loves to see us catching Him at His word. Let us consider the story of Abraham. We are now clear about the difference between a covenant and a promise. God gave to Abraham a promise. When Abraham could not believe it, God ordered him to cut a sacrifice in half, and He passed through it. This made His promise an unchangeable covenant. In this way, Abraham believed. A covenant is a promise that God guarantees the fulfillment of with His faithfulness, righteousness, and highest standard of morality. If God's faithfulness, righteousness, and upright morality fail, God Himself fails. But such a covenant will never fail. God and His covenant exist together. If God failed, His covenant would be made of none effect. But as long as God remains, His covenant remains. If we say that a covenant can be annulled, we are saying that God can be annulled. Saying this blasphemes God. May God deliver us from unbelief and blasphemy.</P><P>The sacrifice used in the covenant in this record is also very meaningful. A heifer signifies Christ's patient and toiling life, and Christ as the peace offering. A she goat signifies Christ's fruitfulness, and Christ as the sin offering. A ram signifies Christ as the powerful victor being slain, and Christ as the burnt offering. The two birds signify Christ being from heaven; the turtledove signifies Christ's suffering life, and the young pigeon signifies Christ's life of faith, by which He daily looked to God for His living. This shows us that the covenant God made with us is in Christ and is as firm as a seal; it is eternally immutable. The covenant that God made with us was made through the work of Christ and in Christ. God not only promised salvation, but accomplished redemption. Now there is not only a promise, there is also a fact. This covenant is as firm as the work of Christ.</P><P>In the Bible there are many covenants and promises, and we cannot consider them all. We can only consider the covenants that God made with Abraham and David. In Matthew the genealogy of the Lord Jesus tells us that Christ is the descendant of Abraham and the descendant of David. Hence, we can consider these two as representatives in the matter of covenant making. Both 2 Samuel 7:4-15 and Psalm 89:19-37 show us this matter. Samuel did not show us how God made the covenant with David. But Psalm 89 shows us that Jehovah sent Nathan the prophet to David; the word that he said to David was a covenant. David wanted to build a temple for Jehovah, and Jehovah sent Nathan the prophet to him saying, "I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle...Also the Lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house. And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of His kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever" (2 Sam. 7:6, 11b-16). Psalms records the same thing as 2 Samuel, but it points out that this was a covenant. "My covenant shall stand fast with him. /  His seed also will I make to endure for ever, / and his throne as the days of heaven. / If his children forsake my law, / and walk not in my judgments; / if they break my statutes, / and keep not my commandments;/ then will I visit their transgression with the rod, / and their iniquity with stripes. / Nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him, / nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. / My covenant will I not break, / nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips" (Psa. 89:28b-34). God gave His word to the descendants of David as a "handle" for them to lay hold of. He loves to see man taking hold of His word and using it as a means to demand fulfillment from Him. God is pleased to see man doing this. He allows His word to fall into man's hand so that man would specifically do this.</P><P>One day a Canaanite woman asked the Lord to heal her daughter of her sickness. The Lord did not answer her. After the woman pleaded with earnestness, the Lord opened His mouth and said that He was sent to seek the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and that it was not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs. The Lord compared her, a Gentile, to a little dog, and the house of Israel to the children. He was telling the woman that she was not worthy of such blessing. The Lord's word seemed to build a wall around Himself that kept the woman from coming any closer to Him. But the woman caught the Lord's word, and said that even the little dogs could eat the children's crumbs. When she said this, the Lord healed her daughter, and He praised her as being great in her faith (Matt. 15:22-28). God loves to see man taking hold of His word and asking Him to do things based on such words. In His dealings with us, He loves to leave a "handle" for us to take hold of Him, like He did with the woman. But He was afraid that we would not see the handle. As a result, He gave us a greater and more obvious handle, a covenant with us, so that we could believe in Him. The Holy Spirit allowed the woman to find a catch in the Lord's word. She found one word which served as her handle to ask for more. In His parable, the Lord only mentioned the food of the children. He did not mention food for the little dogs. The Lord only mentioned the bread. He did not mention the crumbs of the bread. When the Lord said that she was a dog and not the children, she did not object. But should not dogs also have food? Could they not even eat the crumbs? She found a handle in the Lord's word. When she asked the Lord to give her the crumbs, the Lord could not ignore her, but had to respond to her. The reason for this is that He is faithful, and He leaves a "handle" in His word for man. When man lays hold of such a handle, God is most pleased.</P>
