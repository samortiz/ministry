   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>28 RESTING AND ENJOYING Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Genesis 24:63-64 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis 25:11 Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Genesis 25:20-21, 24 And the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Genesis 26:24-25</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We thank the Lord that in the Old Testament He has given us a wonderful and clear picture of the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Testament we have the revelation of the experience of life, but we do not have as clear a picture of it as we have in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are all familiar with the proverb which says that a picture is better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although we have spent many years considering the experience of life as revealed in the New Testament, we cannot be certain about it only by the words in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We also need the pictures in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By the Lord's mercy, we have seen through the years that all the stories in the Old Testament depict the various aspects of the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Deep within, I feel that the Lord has shown us the full picture and has enabled us to understand its real significance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we have already pointed out, there are three aspects to every Christian's experience of life the aspect of Abraham, the aspect of Isaac, and the aspect of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we did not have this clear view, we would only consider Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as three separate individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But, after receiving the revelation and understanding it in the light of the New Testament, we realize that these three men are not three separate individuals, but three aspects of one complete person in the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some, finding it difficult to believe that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob represent three aspects of one complete person, may say, "How can you say that Abraham is not a complete person?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Abraham is just Abraham, and the same is true for both Isaac and Jacob."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you do not believe that these three people are three aspects of the complete experience of one person, I would ask you this question: Can you see God's selection in Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first item in our experience of God is His selection, His choice, which was made before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We see this clearly in the New Testament Eph 1:4 , but we cannot see it in the experience of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, as far as God's selection is concerned, Abraham needs someone else to perfect him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The selection which we cannot find in Abraham's life is revealed in Jacob's. In addition to being selected, we Christians are also called.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Isaac we see neither selection nor calling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, in himself, Isaac is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Isaac's calling is in Abraham just as Abraham's selection is in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By these two examples we should all be convinced that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob depict three aspects of one complete person in the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In a sense, we are all Abrahams, for we have been called and have learned to live by faith in God and in fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since we have also been put into the position of grace, we are also Isaacs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we shall see in later messages, we are Jacobs as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The aspect of Isaac unfolds the matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have not only been called and have learned to live by faith in God and in fellowship with Him, but we are daily enjoying something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not have any enjoyment in our Christian life, we will not be able to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, we would be very miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord that we not only have the aspect of Abraham but also the aspect of Isaac, which is the aspect of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Grace simply means the enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is God Himself becoming our enjoyment in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many times we have difficulties which trouble us mentally and emotionally.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nevertheless, while we are suffering in our mind and emotion, there is a sweet sense deep within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It seems that if we did not have this suffering, we would not have this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Christian suffering brings us the Christian enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the moment we called on the name of the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Savior, we began to have these two aspects in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps the very night you received the Lord Jesus your wife gave you a difficult time, disagreeing with your becoming a Christian and calling it silly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She immediately began to persecute you, and you suffered in your mind, emotion, and senses.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But while you were suffering, deep within you sensed something sweet which caused you to be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, even at the beginning of your Christian life you had both the aspect of suffering, which is the aspect of Abraham, and the aspect of enjoyment, which is the aspect of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the previous message we saw that Isaac inherited grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With him, everything was a matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He was born in grace, was grown up in grace, and was made an heir of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this message we need to see that with Isaac there was also the matter of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His life was a resting and enjoying life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The record of Isaac's life does not indicate that he suffered much.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, it reveals that he was always resting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is proved by his meditating in the field 24:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Could Isaac have meditated if he had not been quiet and restful?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No. In order to meditate we must be restful.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever we are troubled, we are unable to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Isaac was always resting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Genesis 24, he had lost his mother, did not have a wife, and his servant had gone away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yet, he was not troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He went to the field to meditate, not to cry out to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He did not say, "O Lord, what should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have lost my mother, I do not have a wife, and my servant has gone away.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Lord, have mercy upon me!"</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Isaac did not cry out in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Instead, he meditated.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although we cannot find the word resting in the record of Isaac's life, the fact is there nonetheless.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Isaac was a very restful person.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In spite of the troubles he encountered with the Philistines over the wells, he was always at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although Isaac faced some troubles, he himself was not troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>While the Philistines were contending for the wells, he remained restful.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Isaac seemed to be saying, "If you don't want me to stay here at this well, then I'll go elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When you come to bother me there, I'll go to still another place."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>By this we see that Isaac was truly a restful person.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Are you always restful?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Consider your experience during the past twenty-four hours.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Did anything bother you and cause you to lose your rest?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Most of us would have to admit that we have been troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This shows that although we are Isaacs, we are not always resting.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Recently I was doing some difficult and exhausting work on the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But I can praise the Lord that as I was working, I was very restful and I could say, "I have nothing and I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There is no need for me to do anything, because the Lord is doing it all."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We all need to be restful people.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Isaac was not only resting; he was also enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>His entire life was a life of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When he was old, he still had the taste for "savoury meat" and asked Esau to go out to the field and prepare him the meat which he loved 27:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When Rebekah heard this, she called Jacob to fetch her two kids of the goats that she might prepare the meat for Isaac 27:5-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Eventually, after both Jacob and Esau had come with meat for their father, Isaac got a double portion.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Esau, Rebekah, and Jacob were busy, but Isaac just sat there enjoying the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>By this we see that Isaac was an enjoying person, always enjoying the provision of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This enjoyment was his destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Enjoyment is also our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Young brothers, do not worry about finding a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you remain restful and full of enjoyment, the best wife will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In our Christian life there is the aspect of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I have been striving since I was twelve years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Now, after almost sixty years, I can testify that many times my striving has frustrated the coming of the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If I had not striven, the enjoyment would have come much earlier and in a richer way.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Why does striving frustrate the enjoyment?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Because enjoyment is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We all have been predestinated for it.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Young brothers, forget about your striving.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Simply go home, pray, praise, and sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The next morning rise up, have a good morning watch, and eat a hearty breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Do not worry about finding a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Rebekah will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This is the enjoyment which is our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Are we not the sons of God?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>How can the sons of God be pitiful people?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We must declare, "Praise the Lord that I am a son of God!</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The almighty, all-sufficient God is my Father!"</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The word father denotes a rich provision.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>As long as we have a rich father, we have the provision and have no need to worry.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We should simply enjoy this bountiful provision.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This is our destiny.</S>
