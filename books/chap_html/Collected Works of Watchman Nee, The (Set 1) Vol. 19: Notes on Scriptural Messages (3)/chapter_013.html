<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PATHWAY TO GLORYâ€”</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THROUGH JERUSALEM</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 9:28-31</H1><P>The word we should pay attention to in this passage is "Jerusalem." I will clarify a few things first, and then I will come back to this. The Bible records that God spoke to the Lord Jesus from the heavens three times. The first time was when the Lord Jesus rose up from baptism (Matt. 3:16-17); the second time was on the mount of transfiguration (Luke 9:28-35), and the third time was after the Lord said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone" (John 12:24-28). There is one reason why God spoke to the Lord Jesus these three times: He purposely chose the cross! He did not choose a way better than the cross! His baptism was a choice of the cross, a choice of death and burial. On the mount of transfiguration, He also chose the cross; He did not ascend to heaven from there. When He entered Jerusalem and a few Greeks requested to see Him, it was the most glorious moment of His life. But He still chose the cross. He did not choose to be a king as the result of men's adulation.</P><P>In today's passage, we see how the Lord chose the cross. Many people say that the mount of transfiguration is a type of the kingdom of God. But the Lord Jesus said that the mount of transfiguration was the kingdom of God. In Luke 9:27 He said clearly, "But I say to you truly, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God." The kingdom of God descended to the earth for a moment, and the Lord Jesus manifested His glory in the kingdom. The Lord could have ascended to heaven from there, but He was discussing all the things related to the fact of what "He was about to complete in Jerusalem." He purposely chose the cross. Two men, Moses and Elijah, were talking with Jesus. Elijah represents those who will be raptured, whereas Moses represents those who will be resurrected. At that time, the Lord Jesus was standing at the place of the rapture and the resurrection. However, He had a clear view and a clear vision that the pathway to glory was not the mount of transfiguration, but another way.</P><P>Before He came to the mount of transfiguration, the pathway was not so clear. Although it had been decided before the foundation of the world, the pathway became clear after the conversation on the mount of transfiguration. The pathway had to pass through Jerusalem. From this point on, we see the Lord descending from the mountain and heading toward Jerusalem. "And as the days were being fulfilled for Him to be taken up, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem" (Luke 9:51). "And He journeyed...making His way toward Jerusalem" (13:22). "In the same hour some Pharisees came up, saying to Him, Get out and go from here, for Herod wants to kill you" (v. 31). They were suggesting that the Lord change His course. But the Lord answered saying, "I must journey today and tomorrow and on the following day because it is not acceptable for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem" (v. 33). He headed straight toward Jerusalem and would not turn at all. Luke 17:11 says, "And as He was going to Jerusalem..." He did not change His course. Luke 18:31 says, "Behold we are going up to Jerusalem." Luke 19:11 says, "He was near Jerusalem." Verse 28 says, "And having said these things, He went on before them, going up to Jerusalem." Verse 37 says, "And as He was already drawing near..." Verse 41 says, "And as He drew near..." Verse 45 says, "And He entered into the temple." This shows us that the Lord approached Jerusalem step by step!</P><P>From Luke 9 to 23, we see a line that leads to Jerusalem. This course was set on the mount of transfiguration.</P><P>Was the Lord's heart for Jerusalem itself? No, it was not for Jerusalem but for what would be accomplished in Jerusalem, which was the cross. Jerusalem means the accomplishment of God's will, which is the bearing of the cross. On the mount of transfiguration, glory purposely descended to the world, and the Lord Jesus was enveloped in this glory. In that vision the Lord Jesus clearly saw that the way to glory was through Jerusalem. His face was set toward Jerusalem. Isaiah said that He set His face like a flint (Isa. 50:7). He faced Jerusalem with a stone-like face; there was no change in Him; He went straight from the mountain to the cross.</P><P>Why should we pay attention to this matter today? It is because the day of the rapture is near! The day when the Lord will rapture the saints is near! We are not speaking about who will or will not be raptured. We are saying that if a person wants to be raptured, he has to go to Jerusalem. This means that we have to bear the cross; we have to take this pathway. If God has shown us the glory, the rapture, and the resurrection, we have to obey His will and bear the cross, taking up the way of the cross. Please remember that even though the Lord Jesus knew that the time of His being taken up was at hand, He did not wait passively for the rapture. The Bible says, "And as the days were being fulfilled for Him to be taken up, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem" (Luke 9:51). The cross came before the rapture. If we know that the day is near, we should also set our mind to obey God's will concerning us, which is to bear the cross. The meaning of going up to Jerusalem is nothing other than bearing the cross, which accomplishes God's will.</P>
