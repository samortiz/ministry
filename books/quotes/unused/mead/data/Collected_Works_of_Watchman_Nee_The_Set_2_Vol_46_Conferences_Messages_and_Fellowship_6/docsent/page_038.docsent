   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The essence of the teaching in Colossians 2 is dealing with things of the world in self-chosen lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The result is being puffed up to the satisfaction of the flesh and the nourishing of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This occurs because we think that we are doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The one who works gets the glory.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we meet a good Roman Catholic priest or Buddhist priest, we would conclude that he was not worldly.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is not spiritual.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is a place for the family life to be sanctified and for the old natural life to be touched and dealt with.</S>
