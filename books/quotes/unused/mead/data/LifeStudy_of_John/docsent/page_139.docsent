   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning Judgment a. The Judgment Being for the Devil,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Author of Sin, the Origin of Death,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>the Father of All Sinners,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>and the Ruler of the World</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 11 the Lord said that the Spirit will convince the world concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen that judgment is related to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan, the devil, is the author of sin, the origin of death, the father of all sinners, and the ruler of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As such, judgment has been prepared for him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must recognize that judgment is not for man but for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not God s intention to judge man, because His judgment is for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The lake of fire has been prepared as God s judgment upon Satan; it was never intended for man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What verses prove that the lake of fire has been prepared for Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The book of Revelation does not clearly tell us this, but the book of Matthew does.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Matthew 25:41 the Lord said that the King will say to some people, Go from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Was the everlasting fire prepared for human beings?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No, it has been prepared for Satan, the devil, and his angels, his followers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if you refuse to come out of Adam into Christ, you will share the judgment that is for Satan, because you prefer to remain as one of his followers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Ruler Being Judged in the Flesh of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>on the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Satan, the ruler of the world, has been judged in the flesh of Christ on the cross 12:31-33; 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the cross the Lord as the Son of Man 12:23 was lifted up in the form of the serpent 3:14 , that is, in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan as the old serpent Rev 12:9; 20:2 , the ruler of this world, had injected himself into man s flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through His death on the cross in the likeness of the flesh of sin, the Lord destroyed Satan, who is in man s flesh Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By judging Satan 16:11 in this way, the Lord also judged the world, which is hanging on Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the Lord s being lifted up caused the world to be judged and its ruler, Satan, to be cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Any Sinner Not Believing in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Will Remain with the Devil</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>and Share His Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have seen that the lake of fire is not for human beings but for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Any sinner who does not believe in the Son will remain with the devil and bear his judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you go along with Satan and remain one of his companions, you will be with him in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God loves the world and has no intention that any human being be cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That judgment is intended for the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, if anyone remains a companion of Satan, God has no choice but to allow him to suffer Satan s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The three items of sin, righteousness, and judgment are a sketch of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The gospel is that we are sinners in Adam, but that we can be righteous and justified in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are unwilling to be translated from Adam into Christ, we must be warned that we shall share the judgment with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, you were born in Adam, but God s intention is to take you out of Adam and translate you into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you disagree with God s intention, you must remain in Adam and share the judgment with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sin is of Adam, righteousness is of Christ, and judgment is for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you are willing to be translated from Adam into Christ, you will be saved, having nothing to do with the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The work of the Holy Spirit involves these three items, and every time we preach the gospel we must tell people about them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the gospel whereby the Holy Spirit convinces sinners to repent and to believe in the Lord Jesus in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 1933 I was asked to stay in Shanghai with Brother Nee and the leading co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One day, in my reading of John 16, I saw that sin, righteousness, and judgment are related to the three persons of Adam, Christ, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some time later the church in Shanghai had a gospel-preaching meeting, and I was asked to give the message.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I learned later that that invitation was a little test from Brother Nee to see where I would stand in the matter of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During that meeting I was burdened to give a message on the three items related to these three persons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As I looked around the meeting hall, I did not see Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Quite a while later I learned that he stood behind the meeting hall door listening to the message.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As I preached, I was very excited with these points, telling the people, As human beings you were born in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today your name is Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Adam you have sinned and you have been condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But there is another person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is a way for you to get out of Adam and into Christ that you may be justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you believe in Christ, you will get into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You will be translated from the first person into the second.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if you do not believe in Christ, you will still remain in the first person, and eventually your destiny will be the destiny of the third person, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Judgment has been prepared for Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Are you going to help him?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Are you going to have pity on him?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Are you going to help him suffer judgment for eternity?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This was the message I gave shortly after I had seen the light on these matters in John 16.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As I delivered that message, I myself was fully nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Some time later, Brother Nee had a talk with me about that message, saying, Witness, that message was really good.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When I asked him what message, he said the message on Adam, Christ, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then Brother Nee told me, Witness, hardly anyone has seen that in John 16:8-11 sin is related to Adam, righteousness to Christ, and judgment to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I hope that this will be preached wherever the churches go.</S>
