<h2 class="head2">We Have to Start Remembering the Lord<br />(Chikechuang)</h2><p>A few young, immature brothers here have received mercy from the Lord and much care from the brothers in sending the publications. They really have helped us. Because we have been touched by the Lord's love in shedding His blood and dying for us, we feel terrible if we do not remember Him. Therefore, we established the Lord's table on February 25. We are weak and immature, and we really need the prayers and teaching from all the churches.</p><p>Lee Ze-min, Liu Xue-li, Wang Chung-xin, Chang Zai-sheng<br />February 26, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">Beginning to See (Changsha)</h2><p>As the church has been seeking the matter of unity, Brother Lan came to Changsha for a conference of seven messages. Many brothers and sisters from the denominations saw the light. Many among them have a heart to have individual fellowship with us, and many come to the meetings often. Another matter which comforts us even more is the young brothers and sisters in the schools. They are beginning to see something inwardly. On the negative side, they have seen that the sects are sin; on the positive side, some of them have seen the testimony of the Body.</p><p>The church in Xiangtan has begun to break bread. Brother Chang Ting-fu and others are responsible. God is moving in a mighty way in various individuals. There is a preacher of a denomination whose wife and daughters are meeting with our brothers. He says that he will take our way.</p><p>Our outward condition is very good, but we lack those who are thoroughly consecrated. We are praying earnestly and hope that some weighty ones who have learned some lessons will come here. There is much work to do and those who are consecrated are few. The looseness in the church service is manifest. We look to the Lord for the way ahead of us. Please remember these immature children much.</p><p>Chang Fang-zheng<br />March 2, 1951</p><h2 class="head2">The Practice of Reading the Bible (Peking)</h2><p>Of the twenty-eight ways to read the Bible, I picked the way of reading book by book. Next I read it historically. From the book of Genesis, I chose seven pairs&mdash;Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Enoch and Noah, Abraham and Lot, Isaac and Ishmael, Jacob and Esau, and Joseph and his brothers. There is also the way of identifying one theme, like the theme of a river; I can find the source, the effect of the river, as well as its spiritual teachings. I also take the way of finding the facts. I also tried to trace the word redemption. Before God I looked to see God's complete plan for redemption.</p><p>In the matter of coordinating to serve the Lord, I am more and more clear in the Lord's light that there is no other way except for submitting to authority. Once there is lawlessness or disobedience, I feel uncomfortable.

The number of people in the gospel meetings has increased. There are many newly-saved ones. The churches will all have baptism meetings soon. In Banhu there are one or two times of fellowship every Lord's Day concerning the church. People have also come seeking fellowship in Donghai. Thank God that He is really with us in each time of sharing or prayer. He has increased our faith.

While talking with the brothers, I learned that there are good brothers in Dangtu, Anching, and Hefei. There have been meetings in Dangtu for several months. At first there were five brothers who had a heart for the Lord. They had no lack in their living. They prepared the meeting place and chairs. They preached the gospel often, and soon they will have a baptism meeting and will break bread. A sister from Nanking went to Anching and is in nursing school. Three brothers from Wuhu went there; two are working on a farm, and one is working in a bank. Their wives are all sisters. There is a brother named Wang Yi-xun, who is from Anching and who studied at Anhwei University in Wuhu. He became ill and has returned home to rest. They are all desperate to have meetings. They really hope that some people from Shanghai could go there to help them begin the meetings.</p><p>Ji Yung-tong<br />February 16, 1951</p>
