   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, we can come to You around Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What a mercy and grace!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We trust in You for the understanding of Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We admit our inadequacy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are short short of understanding, short of utterance, even short in listening.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Anoint our ears and our minds.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anoint the speaking mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May You speak in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We like to practice the one spirit with You, especially in this hour in speaking Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, do cleanse us with Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How we thank You that where the blood is, there the rich anointing is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We trust in Your anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We look to You desperately for such a mysterious word tonight.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Your mighty name we ask.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have covered the first two items of the basic revelation in the Holy Scriptures God's plan and Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this chapter we come to the third item the Spirit's application.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the most mysterious item in the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Printing may be used as an illustration of the application of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In printing there is first the draft, the manuscript.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This manuscript is then typeset onto a page, which is then made into a negative.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then the printing press, using the negative, produces however many copies are wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This last stage, producing the copies, illustrates the Spirit's application.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ did a great work of "typesetting" what God purposed in His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He became incarnated and lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then He died on the cross, was resurrected, and ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By such a long process, from incarnation to ascension, the Lord Jesus has done the wonderful typesetting work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This work produced a "negative."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now the Spirit comes and applies to us what Christ has done.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Father planned, the Son accomplished, and the Spirit comes to apply what Christ accomplished according to the Father's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the best printing results clean, pure paper must be used.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why the first thing the Spirit applies to us is the cleansing of the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit cleanses us with the redeeming blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through the precious blood, we have been washed and cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we are clean, pure paper, good for this spiritual printing.</S>
