THE RECOVERY OF THE DIVINE REVELATION<br>CONCERNING THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The fifth item in the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Believers Being Tripartite Beings<br>of Spirit, Soul, and Body</H2><P>The believers are tripartite beings of spirit, soul, and body (1 Thes. 5:23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Believers Being Redeemed, Justified,<br>and Reconciled to God in Christ</H2><P>The believers are redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God in Christ (Rom. 3:24; 5:10a). We have not only been saved; we have been redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Believers Having Been Baptized<br>into the Triune God to Have an Organic Union<br>with the Processed Triune God</H2><P>The believers have been baptized into the Triune God to have an organic union with the processed Triune God (Matt. 28:19). In his Word Studies in the New Testament, M.R. Vincent, writing on Matthew 28:19, said, "Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with Him." Such a thought, such a revelation, has been lost in Christianity. Baptism is to baptize us into the Triune God that we may have an organic union with the processed Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Believers Being Regenerated in Their Spirit<br>by the Spirit with the Divine Life, Which Is Christ,<br>to Be the Children of God, Having<br>the Divine Nature, and the Members of Christ<br>in the Union of the Divine Life</H2><P>The believers are regenerated in their spirit by the Spirit (John 3:5-6) with the divine life, which is Christ (Col. 3:4a), to be the children of God (John 1:12-13), having the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4b), and to be the members of Christ (Rom. 12:5) in the union of the divine life. Regeneration takes place in our spirit. It is carried out by the Spirit with the divine life, and it makes us, first, the children of God, and then, the members of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>A Brief Presentation of the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
