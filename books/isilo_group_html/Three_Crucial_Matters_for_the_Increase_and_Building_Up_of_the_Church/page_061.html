AFTER BAPTIZING THEM</h2>
<p>During the time when we were researching how to knock on doors, as soon as a person was baptized and changed his clothes, we would rush out the door to baptize the next person. This is no longer our practice. It is best to spend some time to nourish a person immediately after he is baptized and then go back to visit him the next day. We need to visit the new believers many times during the first month, because it is easy for them to become sick or to die prematurely. It is best to use the first thirty days to stabilize the new believers.</p>
<p>For this reason, those whom we baptize must be visited at least ten times in the first month after their baptism. Otherwise, they may die prematurely. During the past decades we baptized many people, but most of them died prematurely and few have remained, because we did not learn this lesson. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain&rdquo; (John 15:16). The secret to bearing remaining fruit is to nourish them. This can be compared to a baby being fed milk immediately after it is born. After we baptize someone, we must nourish him immediately and then continue to nourish him during the next thirty days.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING A SEPARATING LINE<br />
BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS<br />
IN THE COORDINATION</h2>
<p>Someone asked whether a brother and a sister can coordinate together. This must be avoided. Even though this does not break the law, it violates the principle in the Bible. We must not allow the single brothers and single sisters to have too much personal contact. It is best for them to have as little contact as possible. There should be a distance between the brothers and the sisters. This has been our practice for many decades. We do not approve of two members of the opposite sex being alone together in a room, especially if the door is closed and the room has no windows. This is forbidden. Hence, we should not think that it is a matter of convenience for a brother to give a sister a ride in a car in order for her to do her shopping. It is fine for a brother to accept a ride from a brother and for a sister to accept a ride from another sister, but it is not acceptable for a brother and a sister to ride together alone in a car. It is absolutely against our principles for a single brother and a single sister to do anything together. We must maintain this testimony.</p>
<p>People who have not received the Lord are not concerned when a man and a woman walk together or do something together, but when a brother and a sister walk together, they lose their testimony. However, this does not mean that unbelievers do not have standards concerning male-female relationships. Hence, they criticize the Christians who behave as they do. They know that the morality of Christians is very high and that Christians cannot be like other people. We cannot necessarily do things that other people do, even if it is legal. Some legal things are not up to our standard of morality.</p>
<p>We must not allow a brother and a sister to do things by themselves alone. A husband and wife can go out together, and no one will say anything because they are married. But there should be a distance between a brother and a sister who are not married. Just as the meal offering could not be mingled with honey (Lev. 2:11), the brothers and sisters must have a living testimony.</p>
<p>This is especially important when we go to the towns and villages to preach the gospel, because the neighbors are watching us. They know that we are a group of people who are preaching Jesus, so they will watch us. Therefore, the married saints must have a proper relationship so that other people can see that Christians are different. Male-female relationships are an important aspect of morality. In human ethics and morality the relationship between a husband and wife is crucial. The Bible condemns anything that damages the marital relationship. Nothing damages God&rsquo;s creation and the man God created more than improper relationships between males and females. We must remember this.</p>
<p>Even though I am an old man, I would never allow a sister to take me to get my hair cut when I cannot find a brother to take me. I would rather delay an errand than go against this principle, even though I am already elderly. May we all pay attention to this matter. We cannot avoid contacting people when we serve the Lord; hence, we must maintain a proper testimony when we contact members of the opposite sex. Otherwise, in our service to the Lord, we will encounter problems. We must be very careful in this matter. This especially applies to the brothers. The brothers must remember to keep their contact with the sisters pure and in the light. They should not fall into a situation in which others can criticize them in this area.</p>
<p>Today some women do not seem to have any sense of shame. Shamefacedness is a virtue, and females must have some sense of shame. It is part of the God-created female disposition. It is wrong for a female, especially for a girl who is eighteen or nineteen years old, to be flirtatious or to wear clothing that does not cover her. Women should have a sense of shame. The sisters must remember that they are sisters and that they need to be preserved.</p>
<p>More than fifty years ago the China Inland Mission sent many people to China. They sent at least ninety young sisters from England. These young sisters were met by an elderly Western sister in Shanghai whose commission was to help them preach the gospel in China. In those days the young women in the West liked to wear modern skirts that were shorter than the old-fashioned skirts, which were long and reached the floor. This elderly sister would invite the young sisters for afternoon tea and snacks. After tea this elderly sister would spend time to speak with the sisters. While she was speaking, she would continually pull at her skirt below her knees. After pulling at her skirt a few times, the young sisters began pulling at their skirts, because they realized that their skirts were short and did not adequately cover them.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, it is a shame, not a glory, for the fallen human body to be exposed. It is a shame, not a glory, for a person to expose his back or chest. In the Old Testament times women even covered their heads. Today women in Islamic countries cover their entire face. In principle, it is better for less of the body to be exposed. When we cover ourselves, we cover our shame. After the fall man&rsquo;s first sense was to be ashamed of his nakedness; therefore, Adam and Eve made loincloths to cover their shame (Gen. 3:7).</p>
<p>When we go out to spread the gospel, we must be careful. We are all co-workers. In our service it is difficult to avoid contact between brothers and sisters; therefore, we must understand the situation and maintain these principles. Brothers must remain in their position as brothers and not be loose in their speech. Sisters must remember that they are females and keep the feminine virtue of shamefacedness. In this way, the Lord will preserve us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Crucial Matters for the Increase and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 61</div><br></body></html>
