   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE A LIFE OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible discloses the proper course of a believer's life in the following verses: "But the righteous shall have life and live by faith" Rom 1:17 ; "the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God" Gal 2:20 ; and "we walk by faith, not by appearance" 2 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After reading these verses, we know that a believer lives by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we may be quick to understand this in our mind, we cannot easily experience it in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A life of faith is entirely different from a life of feeling; in fact, the two are opposites.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One who lives by feeling does God's will and sets his mind on the things in heaven only when he feels excited.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As soon as the pleasant feeling ceases, everything else ceases with it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A life of faith is not this way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Having a life of faith is living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Faith considers the One in whom it believes to be the mastermind, not the believer himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Faith does not look at the situation it encounters, but at the One in whom it believes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although everything around faith may change, if the One in whom it believes has not changed, faith continues on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Faith maintains a relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It does not depend on feeling; it depends on the God in whom it believes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Faith moves according to the One it believes, while feeling moves according to how it feels.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Faith looks at God, but feeling looks at itself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God never changes; He is the same whether the day is cloudy or sunny.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, one who lives by faith is as unchanging as God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His living is the same in darkness or in light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The feeling of a believer constantly changes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, one who lives by his feeling inevitably leads a life of ups and downs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God requires that His children not regard enjoyment or pleasure as their objective.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He wants them to live only by faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as they run the spiritual course when they feel good, they should keep going when they feel miserable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their attitude towards God should not vary according to how they feel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although they sense dryness, tastelessness, and darkness, if they know that a certain matter is according to God's will, they should persist onward, trusting God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Often it seems that there is a rebellion in them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They feel sad, depressed, and discouraged to the point that they want to cease all the activities of their spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, knowing that the work in this spiritual journey must go on, they should ignore all contradictory feelings and continue to press onward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a life of faith, a life that does not care for feeling but for God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If one believes that a certain thing is God's will, even though he has no interest in it, he does it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A person who lives by feeling does things only according to his interest; a person who lives by faith does all of God's will whether or not it is enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A life of feeling draws a person to live apart from God Himself by causing him to be satisfied after obtaining a certain amount of happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A life of faith causes a person to live by God and to be satisfied after obtaining God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since he has already gained God, he is not made any happier because he feels happy, nor is he made bitter because he feels bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A life of feeling causes a believer to live for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A life of faith causes a person to live for God without leaving any room for the self-life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the self is given a reason to be happy in one area, there is no living by faith in that area, only a living by feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only pleasant feelings keep the self happy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A believer lives by his feeling because he has not committed his self-life to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, he reserves a place for the self.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He hopes that in his spiritual journey there will always be something to make the self happy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Christian life is a life of faith from beginning to end. We received a new life by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we must continue by faith to live according to this new life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Faith is the principle for the believer's life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Christian life is nothing other than living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While many believers acknowledge this principle, they seem to forget to apply it in their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They forget that living, acting, and hoping by their emotion and by their feeling of happiness is walking by sight and not by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is a life of faith?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A life of faith is a life that disregards feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In fact, a life of faith is completely contrary to a life of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, if a believer wants to live by faith, he should not change his normal behavior and weep bitterly, thinking that he has lost his spiritual life, whenever he feels cold, dry, empty, and painful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We live by faith and not by happiness.</S>
