   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE THE THIRD OF THE THREE ROUNDS IN THE DEBATES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BETWEEN JOB AND HIS THREE FRIENDS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CHAPTERS 21 31 4 JOB'S FINAL SPEAKING TO HIS THREE FRIENDS 2 Scripture Reading: Job 29 30</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will continue to consider Job's final speaking to his three friends.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>DWELLING ON HIS EXCELLENT PAST</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter twenty-nine is a record of Job's dwelling on his excellent past.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He recalled the days of his prime when the intimate counsel with God was over his tent, the Almighty was with him, and his children were around him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He remembered that he delivered the poor man who cried out and the orphan who had no one to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He also made the widow's heart shout for joy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus Job could declare, "I put on righteousness, and it clothed me;/My justice was like a robe and a turban" v. 14 . Job went on to say that, in his excellent past, he was eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, and a father to the needy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Others listened to his counsel, and after his words they did not speak again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Job chose the way for them and sat as chief, dwelling "as a king among the troops,/As one who comforts those who mourn" v. 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>SIGHING OVER HIS MISERABLE PRESENT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After dwelling on his excellent past, Job in chapter thirty sighed over his miserable present.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Job said that those who were younger than he held him in derision and that others made him a byword, abhorred him, and stood aloof from him, casting off restraint in his presence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Next, Job said that terrors had turned upon him, that his prosperity had passed away like a cloud, that his soul was poured out within him, and that days of affliction had taken hold of him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Job continued by saying that he cried to God, but God did not answer him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Job's feeling, God had turned to become cruel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Job said to Him, "I know that You will bring me into death,/And to the house appointed for all living" v. 23 . Job also sighed over the fact that when he expected good, evil came, and when he waited for light, darkness came.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Job concluded by saying that his inward parts were in turmoil, that days of affliction had drawn near to him, and that his harp had become mourning and his pipe, the voice of those who weep.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here we see a picture of Job's sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Job did not understand the reason for his sufferings, but today we know the reason.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was true that Job suffered, but his suffering was allowed by God for a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wanted to take away all his successes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Job was very successful, both materially and ethically.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He had attained to a very high degree of perfection and uprightness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That was his integrity, and he was proud of it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Job considered his perfection and integrity as a robe to cover him and as a turban to glorify him 29:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, God took these away in order that Job would pursue God Himself instead of other things, yet Job did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He thought that he was right and that God had done something wrong toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, he was hoping to have an opportunity to present his case before God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From this we can see that Job was altogether in another realm, one which was contrary to God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, Job recognized that he had known God only "by the hearing of the ear" 42:5a .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He had heard about God and he had believed in God, but he had never seen God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, through all the strippings and consumings, the time came when Job saw God 42:5b .</S>
