   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Way to be Regenerated</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can God's Spirit enter into man's spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When man hears the Gospel or reads the word of the Scripture, God's Spirit works in him and causes him to feel that he has sinned and is corrupted; hence, he is reproved for sin and righteousness and judgment John 16:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When man sees himself as a sinner, recognizes his corruption, and is willing to repent, then God's Spirit causes him to see that the Lord Jesus is his Savior, and that He died on the cross to shed His blood for the remission of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At this moment, he automatically believes in the Lord and receives Him as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once he receives the Lord as his Savior, God's Spirit enters into his spirit and puts God's life in it, causing him to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE NEED OF REGENERATION A. Because We Are Corrupted</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to be regenerated because of two conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From the negative side, we need to be regenerated because our life has been corrupted and has become evil, and cannot be improved from evil to good.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jer 17:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil" Jer 13:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, nothing good dwells" Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. Because We Lack God's Life</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From the positive side, however, we need to be regenerated because we do not have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of all God's creation, man has the highest development of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No plant or animal has a higher life than man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet man, the highest created life, needs to receive another life for his completion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He needs the uncreated, eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Adam was created, he obtained only created life; he did not at that time obtain God's uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, when we were born of our parents, we obtained only the natural, created human life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That birth gave us an entrance into the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But for us to enter the kingdom of God, we must have another birth from another source.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By our first birth we were born into the kingdom of darkness, but by our second birth we are transferred into the kingdom of the Son of His love Col 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's purpose is that we may obtain His own uncreated life and be transformed by this life into His image to be like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even if our human life had not been corrupted by the fall of man in Genesis 3, we would still need to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Genesis 1 and 2, Adam was without sin, yet he was void of God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, God placed him before the tree of life that he might receive the life of God and be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's purpose in creating man is not merely to obtain a sinless man, but even more to have a God-man, one who has God's own life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>REGENERATION VERSUS THE NATURAL CONCEPT A. Receiving the Life and Nature of God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the greatest wonder in the entire universe that human beings could be begotten of God, and sinners could be made children of God!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through such an amazing divine birth we have received the divine life, which is the eternal life 1 John 1:2 , as the divine seed sown into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose a dog could be born of its master and receive its master's life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such an event would surely catch the attention of the news media.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Would it not be a great miracle for the life and nature of a human being to be imparted to a dog and to make that dog a man-dog?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a dog would not simply be washed, decorated, and beautified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It would actually have the life and nature of a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As astounding as it may seem, through regeneration we have received the life and nature of God.</S>
