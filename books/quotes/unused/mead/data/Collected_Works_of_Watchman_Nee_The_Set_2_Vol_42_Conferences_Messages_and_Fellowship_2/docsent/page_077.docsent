   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VICTORY BEING CHRIST LIVING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Victory is the Lord Jesus living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the Lord lives in us, He overcomes for us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No temptation is so great that He cannot overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has not given us Christ to be our example.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He has given us Christ to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Four years ago I was in New York, and I met a Presbyterian medical doctor with his wife and four children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The wife was about forty years old, and she was very humble.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She came to me and said, "You have to pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Pray that God would give me patience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My four children are driving me crazy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I can tolerate one being rowdy, and I can tolerate two being rowdy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when three start to become rowdy, my temper begins to flare up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If all four become rowdy, I completely lose control of my temper."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I asked, "What do you lack?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She said, "Patience, of course!"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I then asked, "Has the Lord ever answered your prayer for patience?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She said, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I then said to her, "The Lord has not answered this kind of prayer before, and He will not answer this kind of prayer in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You cannot be patient, and you will not be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What you lack is not patience."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She said, "What do you mean?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I do not lack patience, what do I lack?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I said, "What you lack is Christ, not patience, meekness, or quietness."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Patience is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>True humility, meekness, and holiness are just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A brother said to me in Shanghai, "I cannot be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What do I have to do before I can have patience?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I told him that there is a toothbrush factory in Shanghai that sells toothbrushes wholesale; it does not sell toothbrushes retail.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is what our God does He is in the wholesale business; He does not care for retail business.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you want a little patience from Him, He will not give it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has put all virtues in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you believe and receive Him, Christ becomes yours, and all the virtues also become yours.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First Corinthians 1:30 says that God has given Christ to us to be our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I cannot be sanctified in myself; rather, Christ is my sanctification in me and for me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may not realize how precious this substitution is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has given Christ to us to be our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is living out a life of sanctification within us and for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If anyone sees this tonight, I will shake his hand and congratulate him; he is the most blessed man on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are living by yourself, you cannot be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if Christ is living in you, you can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the victory that God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OVERCOMING LIFE An Exchange, Not a Change</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us consider the characteristics of the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First, we must see that the overcoming life is an exchanged life, not a changed life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Victory is not a matter of being changed; it is a matter of being exchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all want to be changed, but God wants to show us that we cannot be changed for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has lost hope in us completely.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He knows that we can never be changed for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Foochow dialect has a colloquial expression Shi-wu-bien, meaning no change until death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A person who is Shi-wu-bien is one who can never change, even until his death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He has shown us that our life is not changed; it is exchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once when I was in Shanghai, I bought a watch.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the time I bought it, the shopkeeper gave me a warranty that guaranteed that he would fix the watch free of charge if it broke down within two years.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The second morning after I bought the watch, I noticed that it was two and a half hours off.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I took the watch to the shop and said to the man, "Why is the watch off by two and a half hours?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The man said, "Okay, okay, I will fix it for you."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After two days I went back to pick up my watch.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After using it for another day, it was off by an hour again.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I took it back for repair a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After it was repaired, I took it home.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The next day the time was the same as it had been the night before; it had not even moved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I took it back again and asked the man to find why it was not moving.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The man said, "Okay, okay, you do not have to say anything more.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We will fix it for you."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After another week I took the watch home.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The next day the watch was three hours fast.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I went to the shop again and said to the man, "I have owned this watch for only twenty days.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Of these twenty days, it has been in your shop for fourteen days and with me for only six days.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Is this your watch or is it mine?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Since you cannot fix it, could you exchange it for another one?"</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But the man said, "There is no such thing as an exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The warranty only guarantees repair work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If it breaks down again, you can bring it in and we will fix it for you, until the two year period expires."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do you see what I mean?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Repairing and exchanging are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Repairing involves making good that which is broken, whereas exchanging involves getting rid of that which is old and replacing it with something new.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Man's concept is to repair, but God's salvation is to exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Most people pray for God to give them power to change for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But this is like fixing my terrible watch; no matter how much one repairs it, it will never be changed for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The only way is to exchange it for a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God's salvation does not help us change for the better; it does not help us to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God's salvation is Christ overcoming for us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God never does a work of changing us; rather, He exchanges our life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A year or two ago, I was in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In a conference that was prepared specifically for Westerners, the subject of victory was brought up.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A Westerner asked, "How can our lives be changed?"</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I answered, "Victory is not a matter of changing our life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Victory is an exchange of life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is not a changed life, but an exchanged life.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Man is concerned only with changing himself.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But in God's eyes, man is too deceitful and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There is no way for him to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Adam cannot be changed into a son of God, and tares cannot be changed into wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Instead, Adam is exchanged for the Son of God, and tares are exchanged for wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Today God has crucified our old man through the Lord's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Christ is living within us and is overcoming for us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Our life has been exchanged; it is not merely changed."</S>
