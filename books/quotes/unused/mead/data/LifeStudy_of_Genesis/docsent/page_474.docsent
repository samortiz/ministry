   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE EIGHTY-THREE BEING TRANSFORMED 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am still burdened about the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Based upon the principle that nearly everything in the book of Genesis is a seed that is developed in the following books of the Bible, we come to 1 Kings 7:13-22, a strong portion in the Word regarding the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Jacob's calling, Jacob's being transformed was mainly related to this matter of the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After his dream at Bethel, Jacob set up a pillar 28:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When he returned to Bethel, he also set up a pillar 35:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When Jacob set up the pillar the first time, he said, "This stone which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house" 28:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indicates that the pillar was not only the pillar, but also that it would become Bethel, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1 Kings we have the first mention of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Prior to that, there was the tabernacle, but no temple.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The most striking feature of the exterior of the temple was the two pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Kings chapter seven we have a detailed picture of these pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am burdened that, having considered the seed of the pillar in Genesis, we now look into the development of this seed in the following books of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later, we shall consider the consummation of this seed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>b Related to the Building of the Temple aa.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By Solomon through Hiram</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The pillars of the temple were built by Solomon through Hiram, "a worker in brass" who was "filled with wisdom, and understanding, and skill to work all works in brass" 1 Kings 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Much of what is found in the Old Testament, such as the tabernacle and the temple, is a shadow, a type.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to know the fulfillment of all these types.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Solomon was a type of Christ, and Hiram was a type of the gifted person in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Undoubtedly, the Apostle Paul was a gifted person; he was the New Testament Hiram.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ephesians 4:11 and 12 say, "And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The gifted persons are given by the Head to the Body to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That the pillars were not built by Solomon directly but by Solomon through Hiram indicates that today Christ does not build up the pillars directly but through the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, we must submit to the hands of the gifted persons, just as the brass was subject to the skilled and gifted hands of Hiram.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>bb.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Two Pillars</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to 1 Kings 7:15, Hiram "fashioned two pillars" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Bible, the number two is the number of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These two pillars stood in front of the temple as a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The thought concerning the pillar in the book of Genesis is that of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After Jacob had arranged a settlement with Laban, he "took a stone, and set it up for a pillar" 31:45 , and this pillar was a testimony 31:51-52 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Undoubtedly, when Jacob set up the pillar in chapter twenty-eight, his concept was also that of a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, he said that this testimony would be the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The temple in the Old Testament certainly was a testimony to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The principle is the same with respect to the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to 1 Timothy 3:15, the house of God, which is the church, is the pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that the church as a whole stands on earth to testify God to the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the two pillars in front of the temple in the Old Testament were a strong testimony of God's building.</S>
