<h2 class="head2">Tung-An, Fukien Province</h2><p>War broke out in Amoy on May 10. Places like Tung-An and others have all been bombed. The believers in the cities are all safe. Praise the Lord! Presently, most believers and their families have moved to Chai-Lin (where there is a meeting hall). They are considering the situation and waiting for the Lord's leading. My family may move to Chuan-Shan; we are praying about it. Some believers in An-Hai, Shui-Tou, and Chuanchow have also moved, but the number is not great. Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>Wang Deng-ming, June 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Kulangsu, Fukien Province</h2><p>Brother Luan:</p><p>I received your letter dated June 3 and am very grateful for the concern of all the brothers and sisters in these places. The war in Amoy erupted suddenly, but through the Lord's care and protection, the brothers and sisters from Amoy and Ho-San arrived safely in Kulangsu. Except for a few who have moved to Hong Kong, most of the local brothers are safe in Kulangsu. Nothing has changed much. Most of the out-of-town brothers and sisters have returned to their homes; some have moved to Southeast Asia. Not many are left. Our meeting hall has been assigned as a relief center. As a consequence, all meetings have been stopped. But we are still carrying on the bread-breaking meeting temporarily in a sister's home. I believe that you are very busy in Hong Kong taking care of hospitality for the refugees. May the Lord be with you. Greetings to you.</p><p>Sister in the Lord,<br />Chen Wan-ching, June 11</p><h2 class="head2">Pu-Tien, Fukien Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Sir:</p><p>Enclosed please find a postal order in the amount of X dollars, of which X dollars are an offering made by brothers and sisters this last Lord's Day for the saints suffering from the war. The rest is for The Open Door.</p><p>The church in Pu-Tien, May 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Brothers in the Lord:</p><p>Peace to you in the Lord! The Lord has been gracious to us, and everything is in peace. Thank the Lord! Please be assured, and please pray for us. Two or three brothers are starting a photographic studio. God has blessed their business, and they have offered according to their income. The Lord is worthy to be praised and worthy of everything. The brothers have asked me to transfer this money to you and to send it to Szechuan and Yunnan for the work. The total amount is X dollars. May the Lord remember your work. Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chu Ai-tseng, June 4</p>
