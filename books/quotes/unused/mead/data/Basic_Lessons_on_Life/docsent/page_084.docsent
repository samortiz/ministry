   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR SPIRIT NEEDING TO BE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE MEANS OF OUR WORSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to John 4:24, our spirit needs to be the means of our worship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to worship God the Spirit in our spirit and with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many saints come to the meeting to meet, but they do not come to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may go through the formality of meeting without rendering the Lord the real worship He desires.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To worship is to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever we begin to exercise our spirit, the worship begins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may think our worship begins when we call a hymn or when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But our worship actually begins when our spirit rises up and is exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, in a meeting we may sing a lot of hymns, yet without worship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even we may read many verses of the Bible, yet without worship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may even pray without worship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many so-called Christian services have singing, the reading of the Bible, a sermon, and a benediction, all without the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was no worship because no one exercised his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our meetings need to be full of the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we come together to meet, before singing, before praying, before reading, before doing anything, all of us should exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There should be such a worshipping spirit in all our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many times the elders exercise their spirit to open the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then they stir up others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not the best situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of the saints must rise up to exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to help the saints to realize that we need to use our spirit to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our spirit needs to worship God directly apart from merely depending upon singing, reading, or praying in a formal way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>OUR SPIRIT NEEDING TO TAKE THE LEAD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>IN ENJOYING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our spirit needs to take the lead in enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is fully shown in Luke 1:46-47.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In these verses Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has exulted in God my Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These two verses, no doubt, are describing the enjoyment of the Lord, and in the enjoyment of the Lord, our spirit has to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, Mary's spirit exulted in God; then her soul magnified the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Her praise to God issued from her spirit and was expressed through her soul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But today we mostly use our soul first.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must learn to directly use our spirit and let the soul be a follower of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our spirit must take the lead aggressively in enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our spirit should subdue our soul to make the soul its follower.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>OUR SPIRIT NEEDING TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>IN SPIRITUAL MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First Corinthians 14:32 says, "The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In our spiritual ministry, our spirit has to take the initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If our spirit is waiting, that means our spirit is dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On all occasions, our spirit should take the initiative to minister something.</S>
