   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. The Flesh Meat of the Cattle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The flesh meat of the cattle is the portion to the offerer 7:15-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The flesh of the peace offering for thanksgiving is good for eating on the offering day v. 15 , whereas the flesh of the peace offering for a vow or a voluntary offering is good for eating for two days vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This shows that the offering for a vow is stronger than the offering for thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the offering for thanksgiving is good to eat for only one day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the offering for a vow or a voluntary offering is stronger, so it can last for two days.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to see the difference between the peace offering for thanksgiving and the peace offering for a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The offering for a vow is stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today we may consecrate ourselves to God with thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may pray, "Lord, I love You, so I consecrate myself to You."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is for thanksgiving, but this is too general.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the other hand, we may offer ourselves to God with a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may pray, "Lord, I come here to make a vow to You.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I give myself to You and marry myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I want to be solely for You always, regardless of what happens or of how I feel."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A vow is something voluntary.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A number of saints may consecrate themselves to Christ and the church, but five years later they may leave the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that they did not have a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A vow is like a marriage tie.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The offering for thanksgiving, though, is based upon our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may stay with someone because of our feeling of love for them, but a vow goes beyond our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is a tie that binds us regardless of feeling or circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All of us need to be ones who are married to Christ for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then regardless of what happens or of how we feel, we will always remain with the Lord for His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am grateful to the Lord that many saints are really bound to Christ by a marriage vow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To make such a vow is to be a real Nazarite according to what is revealed in Numbers 6.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The offering for thanksgiving is emotional and superficial, but the offering for a vow is determined and deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thanksgiving is mostly related to the emotion, but a vow is related to the will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some saints' consecrations are out of thanksgiving, whereas others' consecrations are out of a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to follow the Lord, we need a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Marriage involves a vow with no change, no variation, no alteration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord treasures our vow to Him.</S>
