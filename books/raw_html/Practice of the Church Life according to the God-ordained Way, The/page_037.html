<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Concerning God's Redemption</H2><P>Our learning should include the truth concerning God's redemption in type (Gen. 3:20-21; 4:4) and in prophecy (12:3; 22:18). In Genesis 12 and 22, God prophesied to Abraham that in him and through his seed, all the nations would be blessed. His seed was Christ (Gal. 3:16). This prophecy to Abraham, according to Galatians 3, was God's preaching of the gospel to Abraham concerning His redemption (v. 8).</P><P>At this point I would like to list more truths that we need to spend our time learning in order to prophesy. If you do not know the truths, you will be short not only of material but also of the proper terminology when you prophesy. These truths have been covered in the many messages we have spoken and printed throughout the years, so I will just list most of them here and comment briefly on some of them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Concerning Christ<br>6. Concerning Christ's Redemption<br>7. Concerning the Holy Spirit's Sanctification<br>8. Concerning God's Forgiveness of Sins<br>9. Concerning God's Justification in Christ<br>10. Concerning the Believers'<br>Reconciliation with God<br>11. Concerning the Spirit's<br>Regeneration of the Believers<br>12. Concerning God's Full Salvation<br>13. Concerning the Spirit's Sanctification,<br>Renewing, and Transformation of the Believers</H2><P>The truth concerning the Spirit's sanctification is of two steps. Many teachers made the mistake of considering that the sanctification of the Spirit is only of one step. The first step of the Spirit's sanctification is before man's repentance (1 Pet. 1:2). Without the Spirit's move in sanctifying and separating man, no one would repent. After our repentance and regeneration, the Spirit continues His sanctifying work (Rom. 6:19, 22). This is the second step of sanctification. This step of sanctification continues through the process of renewing and transformation. We must also study the items of renewing and transformation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>14. Concerning the Conformation and Glorification of the Believers<br>15. Concerning the Church<br>as the Body of Christ, as the New Man,<br>as the House of God, and as the Kingdom of God<br>16. Concerning the Economy of God<br>and the Divine Dispensing<br>17. Concerning the Rapture of the Believers,<br>the Great Tribulation, and<br>the Second Coming of Christ<br>18. Concerning the Reward and Punishment<br>of the Believers at the Judgment Seat of Christ<br>and in the Coming Kingdom<br>19. Concerning the Kingdom, Millennium,<br>and the Age of Restoration</H2><P>The kingdom is the millennium, and the millennium of one thousand years is the age of restoration.</P>
