   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ONE TOWER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After Jacob set up the third pillar, he "journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder" 35:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Hebrew Eder means "flock."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Micah 4:8 the same Hebrew phrase is rendered "tower of the flock."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here at the tower of Eder something defiling, shameful, and immoral happened to Jacob: his son Reuben committed adultery with Jacob's concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This did not take place at the pillar, but at the tower.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe that the tower of Eder, the tower of flocks, indicates the ease of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jacob had many flocks.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As he passed by the tower of Eder, he might have considered it a good place to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead of proceeding to Hebron, his destination, he stayed by the tower of Eder.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that Jacob had come to a place where he could enjoy an easy life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As he was enjoying this easy life, something sinful occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sin, especially the sin of adultery, always comes in when we are at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fact that Reuben committed adultery with Jacob's concubine at that place was an indication that Jacob should not have stayed there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He should have journeyed on directly to Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If he had not spread his tent by the tower of Eder, probably this evil thing would not have occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although Jacob set up three pillars, there was no need for him to build the tower of Eder because it was already standing there as a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As you are on your way following the Lord, there will always be a tower nearby to snare you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The way to escape this trap is not to stop or even look at it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead of spreading your tent by the tower of Eder, you must pass it by.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No matter what stage of the Christian life we are in, there is always a tower to snare us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ease of life is always a temptation to the followers of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every follower of the Lord realizes that his final destination is a long way off.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the journey is so long, you expect to find a place of rest along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But whenever you come to a tower of flocks, you should not think of it as a place of rest it is a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Pass it by and go on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No matter how exhausted you are in following the Lord, you must say, "Lord, help me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I don't want to rest at any tower.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever I come to a tower, I will flee from it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I will never take it as a place of rest."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do this, you will be protected and saved from the snare.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The desire of Jacob's heart was to take Rachel as his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If God had not intervened through Laban, Jacob would immediately have taken Rachel as his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then whomever Rachel brought forth would have been Jacob's firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, God came in and, in a sense, forced Jacob to take Leah as his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, Reuben was actually the firstborn son, and the birthright went to him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This, however, was contrary to the desire of Jacob's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, it did not seem fair.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While Jacob was enjoying the ease of life at the tower of Eder, Reuben committed adultery with his father's concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This evil deed caused him to lose the birthright 49:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First Chronicles 5:1 and 2 clearly indicate that the birthright was given to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here we see God's sovereign adjustment of the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Reuben lost the birthright because of his defilement, and Joseph gained it because of his purity 39:7-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Potiphar's wife tempted Joseph to commit adultery with her, he refused.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because Joseph kept himself pure, he gained the birthright Reuben had lost due to his defilement at the tower of Eder.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, even Jacob's mistake was used by God to adjust the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Praise the Lord for the mistake that brought about the adjustment of the birthright!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But never use this fact as an excuse to say, "Let us do evil that good may come."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, we must bow down and worship God for His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The sovereign God, being fair and just, did not give all three parts of the birthright to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He gave Joseph the enjoyment of the double portion of the land, but He gave the priesthood to Leah's third son, Levi, and the kingship to her fourth son, Judah 49:10; 1 Chron 5:2; Deut 33:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Levi received the priesthood because of his faithfulness to God Deut 33:9 , and Judah obtained the kingship because of his love toward his brothers and his care toward his father 37:26; 43:8-9; 44:14-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this we see the sovereignty of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is behind everything and everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we see this picture and how everything in it fits together, we must worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hallelujah, we are under God's hand!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jacob's biography is our history.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Jacob's life there were three pillars and one tower.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We also shall have the three pillars and the one tower.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I can testify that I have experienced all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I believe that as the years go by many of us will remember this message.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thank the Lord for the three pillars and for the one tower.</S>
