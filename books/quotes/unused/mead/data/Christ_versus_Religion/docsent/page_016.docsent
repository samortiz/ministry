   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE VS.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REGULATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John came neither eating nor drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He behaved utterly contrary to religion and human culture, and because of this the Pharisees and scribes, the religious people, said that he had a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John was indeed a strange person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They could not understand him; so they said he had a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then Jesus came both eating and drinking, and the religious people said, "Look, this man seems to know nothing but eating and drinking."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If any regulation is made saying that we should not eat or drink, it becomes a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the other hand, if any rule is made saying that we must eat and drink large amounts of food and liquid, this also becomes a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But to us, the children of wisdom, it is not a matter of abstaining from food and drink, neither is it a matter of eating and drinking, but absolutely a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Notice the Lord's words in verse 19 of this chapter: "Wisdom is justified of her children" King James Version .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to be impressed with the word "children."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not students of wisdom, but children of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not care so much for the knowledge of wisdom, but we care very much for the life of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are the children of Christ; we have the life of Christ; so we have the life of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To us it is not a matter of regulations do this, and do that, etc. It is not a matter today of so many do's and don't's, but entirely a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I am thirsty, I may drink: I may drink little by little, or I may drink a quantity of liquid at once.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It all depends on life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not ask me why I drink my answer is only that I am thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I am thirsty, do not give me any regulation that I should not drink.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And when I am not thirsty, do not command me to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not ask me why I eat so much it is because I am hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither ask me why I do not eat it is because I am not hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the way to find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regulations and rules are a heavy burden, and Jesus said, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hallelujah, there are no regulations!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are you hungry?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then eat!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are you thirsty?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Drink!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are not hungry or thirsty, do not eat or drink.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You see, as long as we do not have any regulations, we are free, we have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the regulations of religion are just the heavy burden of verse 28.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why the Lord Jesus exclaimed, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden.."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no need for you to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Forget about regulations: eating or not eating, drinking or not drinking forget them all.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When it is convenient, I will eat, and when it is not convenient, I will not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I am thirsty I will drink, and when I am not thirsty, I will not drink.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hallelujah, there are no regulations!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is Christ versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jesus said, "My yoke is easy" 11:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Greek the meaning of the word "easy" is "kindly" or "gentle."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In other words Jesus said, "My yoke is flexible."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you are hungry you eat, and when you are not hungry you do not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His yoke is flexible, His yoke is gentle, His yoke is not unbending.</S>
