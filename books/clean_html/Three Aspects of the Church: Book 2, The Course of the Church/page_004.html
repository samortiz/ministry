<h2 class="head1">REVEALED IN TIME</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Revelation concerning the Church</h2>
<p>The third item of the course of the church is that it is revealed in time. This revelation began in Matthew 16:18. The Lord revealed the church in Matthew 16, because at that time Christ as the mystery of God had been manifested. Therefore, Christ could reveal His own mystery. Since God had been manifested in the flesh, Christ could reveal His own mystery, the church.</p>
<p>Matthew 16 is a great turn in the Bible; it speaks of Christ, the church, and the cross. Every reader of the Bible must emphasize Matthew 16. In this chapter the first great turn is the turn to Christ, the second great turn is the turn to the church, and the third great turn is the turn to the cross. Christ, the church, and the cross are all very great matters.</p>
<p>After Christ was manifested, the mystery of God was no longer hidden, but not until Matthew 16 was this mystery openly known by man. At that time the Lord Jesus was in Caesarea Philippi, and He asked His disciples, &ldquo;Who do men say that the Son of Man is?&rdquo; (v. 13). When the Lord Jesus asked this, He meant, &ldquo;I, Jesus the Nazarene, am a mystery. You must try to tell Me about this mystery. What kind of a story am I? What do people say? What do you, My followers, say that I am?&rdquo; If He had used spiritual words to ask, He would have said, &ldquo;Who do men say that I, the mystery, am? Who do you say that I, the mystery, am?&rdquo; Among them Peter said, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (v. 16). This meant that the mystery of God was not only manifested among men but also recognized by men. At the very least, in the human race at that time Peter knew that this mystery was the Son of the living God; this knowledge was a great matter. Oh, confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness! God was manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16).</p>
<p>We have the assurance that our God was very happy in Matthew 16. In Luke 15 we see the joy of God the Father, signified by the father&rsquo;s rejoicing at the younger son&rsquo;s return (v. 24). However, in Luke 15 the joy is small; in Matthew 16 God&rsquo;s joy is greater because on that day God&rsquo;s mystery in the universe was known by man. On that day there was not only the reality of Christ as the mystery of God, but He also was known by man. Therefore, the Lord responded, &ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon Barjona&rdquo; (v. 17). In the original language, <em>blessed</em> and <em>joy</em> are the same word; there is no way to distinguish between blessing and joy. The Lord said that Peter was blessed, indicating that God was rejoicing.</p>
<p>The mystery of God&mdash;Christ&mdash;was recognized by man; in other words, the first aspect of the mystery was known by man. This is the reason the Lord immediately said to Peter, &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter [the Greek word meaning &ldquo;stone&rdquo;], and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (v. 18). The rock is the mystery of God, which is Christ. The church is built upon the mystery of God, so the church also is a mystery. Just as Christ is the mystery of God, the church is the mystery of Christ. Since the first aspect of the mystery was known by man, the second aspect could be revealed to man. These are the two aspects of the mystery. The first aspect was known by man, and the second was revealed to man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Two Steps of Revelation</h2>
<p>Since the mystery was hidden, it needed to be revealed. Even though the Lord revealed the church in Matthew 16, the revelation that the church is the mystery of Christ was at that time rather objective. Of course, there were some subjective elements in it, such as the Lord saying to Peter that he was a stone and that He would build His church upon Himself as the rock of the foundation. The Lord Jesus meant that Peter was a part of the church that He would build. Thus, as far as Peter was concerned, this was a subjective revelation, but it was still not fully subjective. Only when the apostle Paul wrote the book of Ephesians did this revelation become completely and fully subjective.</p>
<p>A revelation usually has two steps: prophecy and fulfillment. Isaiah 7:14 prophesied that the Lord would become flesh, that is, that the mystery of God would be manifested. This revelation was a prophecy, not the fulfillment. It was not until the Gospels that the mystery of God was fulfilled and manifested. In Matthew 16, when Peter spoke of Christ as the Son of God, he obtained a revelation. This revelation was not a prophecy; it was the fulfillment. Peter saw the fact of the incarnation.</p>
<p>The revelation of the church also has the two steps of prophecy and fulfillment. In Matthew 16, when the Lord revealed the church, the church had not yet been produced. This is similar to the situation in Isaiah 7:14, when the prophet wrote, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.&rdquo; At that time Christ had not yet come. Just as Isaiah 7 is a prophetic revelation of Christ, Matthew 16 is a prophetic revelation of the church. In Matthew 16 the mystery of God was recognized by man, so the Lord could use the way of prophecy to further reveal the mystery of Christ. When Paul wrote the book of Ephesians, the revelation concerning the church was no longer related only to prophecy but rather was related to the fulfillment. Paul revealed the mystery that had been manifested but was not yet understood by men.</p>
<p>Thus, the mystery has two aspects, and each aspect of the mystery has two steps in its revelation. The first aspect of the mystery is the mystery of God, which is Christ; this aspect had the first step of revelation in the Old Testament. When the Lord was incarnated and manifested before the disciples, He was recognized by Peter, and this was the second step, the fulfillment of the revelation. This step of the revelation was received by Peter. The second aspect of the mystery is the mystery of Christ, which is the church. The church was never clearly revealed in the Old Testament and was not revealed in prophecy until the Lord spoke about it in Matthew 16.</p>
<p>Isaiah 7:14 is the prophetic revelation of the first aspect of the mystery, which was fulfilled in Bethlehem, and in Matthew 16:16 Peter received the revelation of this fulfillment. Likewise, Matthew 16:18 is the prophetic revelation of the second aspect of the mystery, which was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost. However, the revelation of the fulfillment of this aspect of the mystery was not given until Paul wrote the book of Ephesians. In Matthew 16 the Lord said that He would build His church, and in Ephesians Paul wrote that the church had come into existence. The apostle Paul could point to the church and say, &ldquo;This is the church, the mystery of Christ, the mystery which has been hidden throughout the ages and the generations but now has been placed before you.&rdquo; Moreover, all of us who are in the church are this mystery; this mystery is in you and me. This is the third step in the course of the church, the step of being revealed in time.</p>
