<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Flowing Out to Dispense Himself<br>with His Divine Life<br>as the Life Element, the Life Supply</H2><P>God is flowing out to dispense Himself with His divine life as the life element, the life supply (Christ as the tree of life), to meet the need of His elect and to be their pleasures and satisfaction (Rev. 22:1-2; cf. Psa. 36:8-9). For this purpose, when Christ died on the cross, not only blood, signifying redemption judicially, flowed forth but also water, signifying the water of life organically to be dispensed into God's elect (John 19:34). We are the Lord's elect. Praise Him that He chose us and then called us to receive Him, the flowing God as the fountain, with Christ as the element in the flow. What pleasure and what satisfaction!</P><P>Psalm 36:8 and 9 say, "They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light." I picked up two words from these verses: satisfied and pleasures. A saved person should be satisfied with Christ and filled up with God's pleasures. God is the fountain of life for satisfaction with the divine pleasures. This is the way to study the Bible to get the intrinsic, central line of life. Fountain, pleasures, and satisfaction are seen in Psalm 36. Without these three words, this psalm is merely the dead letter, which is vanity of vanities, to us. But within this psalm, we can see God as a fountain flowing like a river to satisfy us and fill us up with His pleasures.</P><P>John 19:34 says that when Christ died on the cross, blood and water flowed out of Him. No other Gospel records this fact. John is a book of signs, just like the book of Revelation. Both blood and water are signs. Blood signifies redemption judicially, and water signifies life flowing organically to be dispensed into God's elect. As those who are God's elect, we are in the marvelous line of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God's Flowing Out Being "Bright As Crystal"</H2><P>Whatever God flows out is "bright as crystal" (Rev. 22:1). The water of life is bright as crystal, having no dimness or opaqueness. When this water of life flows in us, it purifies us and makes us transparent as crystal. In the New Jerusalem, the jasper stone is clear as crystal (21:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Lord's Calling with a Promise</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To the Thirsty and Water-seeking<br>Samaritan Woman</H2><P>To the thirsty and water-seeking Samaritan woman the Lord said that He has the living water, which is able to cause her to never thirst again (John 4:10, 14). What a promise and what a calling! This immoral Samaritan woman had many husbands. She was thirsty, so she came to draw water, and the Lord Jesus was sitting there, waiting for her to come. The Lord Jesus purposely detoured His way to go to Samaria to sit at the well of Jacob (vv. 3-8). This Savior is omniscient. He knew that this immoral woman was coming, so He sat there to wait for her. What a mercy! The Lord said, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water gushing up into eternal life" (vv. 13-14). This water quenches not only our thirst but also the thirst of all those whom we contact.</P>
