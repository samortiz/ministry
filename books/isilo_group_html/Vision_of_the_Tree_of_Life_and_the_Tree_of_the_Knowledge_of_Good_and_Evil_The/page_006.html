CONTAINING THE MANY ELEMENTS OF THE LAMB</h2>
<p>The tree of life in Genesis 2 refers to Jehovah God, but the tree of life in Revelation 22 refers to God and the Lamb. In the first two chapters of Genesis God had not yet become flesh, been crucified, resurrected, or entered into man in order to bring man into God. In the last two chapters of Revelation God had already become flesh, died on the cross, and dealt with every negative problem. Furthermore, He had resurrected from the dead and become the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into man and be mingled with man. Therefore, God at the end of the Bible is different from God at the beginning of the Bible. At the beginning of the Bible He is Jehovah God, and at the end of the Bible He is God and the Lamb.</p>
<p>If man had eaten of the tree of life before the fall, what he enjoyed would not have had the elements for dealing with sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, and death, because these were not yet a problem to man. At that time man needed only to be mingled with God as one for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal intention. The elements within God in the garden of Eden are different from the elements within Him today. God has been incarnated to become a man and crucified to deal with sin, the record of sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, and death. He has also resurrected and walked out from the realm of death. Furthermore, not only has He entered into heaven, but He has also brought humanity into heaven, into God. God became flesh, died, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit. This is the God whom we receive today. All these elements have been compounded into the Spirit to deal with all of our problems. Ever since the fall, man has been complicated with the negative problems of sin, the record of sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, and death. God had to deal with these problems on our behalf in order to accomplish His heart&rsquo;s desire in us. Today the Spirit possesses the necessary elements to deal with these problems.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENJOYMENT OF THE TREE OF LIFE<br />
DEALING WITH PROBLEMS AND<br />
ACCOMPLISHING GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION</h2>
<p>We have many problems, but we do not need to struggle in order to deal with them. We do not need to deal with sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, or death, because the elements that deal with these problems are in God. Whether we desire to overcome sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, or death or to do God&rsquo;s will, we do not need to do anything but enjoy God. When we take God in, the many elements within Him will deal with our problems on the negative side and accomplish His eternal intention on the positive side. His eternal intention is that we would have His image to express Him, be subject to Him in order to exercise His dominion, and be His counterpart to be joined to Him.</p>
<p>Man does not need to do anything. On the negative side, we do not need to deal with sin, the record of sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, and death, and on the positive side, we do not need to struggle in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s intention. Our only need is to eat, drink, and enjoy God. If Adam had eaten of the tree of life in the garden of Eden, God would have operated in Adam and accomplished His eternal heart&rsquo;s desire. Similarly, if we eat, drink, and enjoy God, He will operate in us to overcome sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, and death on the negative side. He will also accomplish His eternal intention; we will have His image, exercise His dominion, and be joined to Him on the positive side.</p>
<p>There is no need for man to work. Everything has been accomplished by God&rsquo;s coming to be man&rsquo;s food. Man did not need to do anything before the fall, nor does he need to do anything after the fall. In order to accomplish God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire before the fall, man needed God to enter into him, to supply him with the divine elements, and thus accomplish God&rsquo;s desire through him. After the fall man still needs God to be his life and life supply in order to deal with the problems of sin, the record of sin, the flesh, the world, Satan, and death and in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, because God possesses the elements to deal with man&rsquo;s problems and to accomplish His intention. Every problem requires man to receive the divine elements by eating, drinking, and enjoying God.</p>
<p>For example, when we are healthy, our need is to eat healthy food. But when we are sick or weak, certain elements need to be added to our food. Some elements kill germs; other elements supply more nutrients. We do not need to kill germs, or make nutrients; our only need is to eat. The food that we eat will operate within us to deal with the germs and supply us with nutrients.</p>
<p>There are two significances to God&rsquo;s giving Himself to man as food. If created man wanted to do God&rsquo;s will and accomplish God&rsquo;s intention, he did not need to do anything but take God as food. Then the elements within God would be the supply within man to accomplish God&rsquo;s intention. Fallen man may have the desire to accomplish God&rsquo;s intention, but he has various problems. We do not need to deal with these problems ourselves, but we need to eat God by taking Him as our food. God now has more elements. Within Him are the elements that can deal with our problems and supply our needs.</p>
<p>Both in dealing with the negative problems and in accomplishing God&rsquo;s eternal intention there is no need for man to work. There is no place for human effort. Everything is dealt with by God&rsquo;s entering into us as food. If we see this vision, we will stop our doing, hate our doing, and condemn our doing. Furthermore, we will worship God, saying, &ldquo;I am an enjoyer. I enjoy God and the Lamb, and I am enjoying God as the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to see the vision of God coming to be our food. On the positive side, we need Him as food to supply us with nutrients. On the negative side, we need Him as food to deal with our problems. The elements within Him are sufficient to meet the positive need and the negative need. Whatever our need may be, God has the elements to supply our need. He also has the elements to deal with any problem. In the garden of Eden He did not have as many elements as He has today; He was merely Jehovah God. Now He is God and the Lamb; He became flesh, passed through death and resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit to enter into man, and brought man into God. These steps are now in the Spirit. Hence, when we contact, absorb, receive, eat, and drink the Spirit, we enjoy Him, and the elements within Him deal with our problems and meet our needs.</p>
<p>If a sister continually prays about dealing with sins, she will not be able to deal with sins. She may continually pray to overcome death, but the more she prays, the deader she will be. She may continually pray about dealing with the world, but the more she prays, the more she will be conquered by the world. Such prayers are ineffective. If she eats, drinks, and enjoys the Lord, He will enter deeper into her to be her supply, and spontaneously her sins and the world will be dealt with, and her death will be changed into life. She will not need to do anything. She may be determined to do God&rsquo;s will and to accomplish His intention, but the more she prays and is determined, the worse her situation becomes. If instead of struggling, she absorbs God more, eats Him more, and drinks Him more, she will give Him more opportunities to enter into her. Then she will spontaneously live out His will. This is not a matter of our working or doing but of God being our food. Our only need is to eat and drink Him.</p>
<p>In John 6:57 the Lord said, &ldquo;As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; For the past two thousand years not many believers have understood this word. This thought is completely different from the natural human concept. If we understand this thought, our natural concepts will disappear. We do not need to determine, struggle, or beseech. We need to see that God has come to be our food for us to enjoy. We have only one need, which is to eat, drink, and enjoy Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision of the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
