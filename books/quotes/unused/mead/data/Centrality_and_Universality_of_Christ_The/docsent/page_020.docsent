   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We know that we are identified with Christ and one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, we have to realize that this oneness is possible only in the spirit, not in the body nor in the mind nor in the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are one with the Lord in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord is the Spirit, we have a spirit, and these two spirits are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The divine Spirit is life to the human spirit, and the human spirit is the container, the vessel, to contain and express the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have no human word to express what is on my heart and in my spirit about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is something too great and wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brothers and sisters, I would ask you to read again the sixty-six books of the Bible, look into the universe, and consider what the central point in the divine thought is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The central point in the divine thought is that this wonderful divine Spirit wants to come into this little human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the key, the secret, of the whole universe, and this is the very center of the sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These sixty-six books tell us a great number of things, but the very center of all the things mentioned in these books is this wonderful oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ, as the substance of the Divine Trinity, as the Spirit, comes into our spirit to dwell in it and to be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is nothing that can be more subjective than this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now let us turn to 2 Timothy 4:22: "The Lord be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end of the two Timothys you have such a "hidden" verse.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I say "hidden" because it was hidden to me for over thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I had read the New Testament again and again, and I knew many things in 1 and 2 Timothy, but I did not notice this verse which says, "The Lord be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is regretful that many Christians today do not even know that they have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have the heavenly King in your home, yet you do not know in which room He is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians simply do not know what the human spirit is and where the human spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, 2 Timothy 4:22 tells us that the Lord is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You all know where your ears, eyes, nose, lips, tongue, stomach, hands, and feet are.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You also know that you have a mind and a heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But do you know that besides all these you have a spirit within you?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Thessalonians 5:23 says that you have a spirit, a soul, and a body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The spirit is a part distinct from the soul and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have the burden to stir up your heart to pay attention to the fact that you have a part in you which is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have a room in your building, yet you do not know where that room is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to find the room and open the door, and you will see the heavenly King in it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In your building there is such a wonderful room, a secret chamber, where He is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, this Bible is a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all believe that the Bible is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this Word we are told clearly that the Lord is with us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even though very few Christians today know that they have a spirit and very few know how to exercise their spirit, the Bible clearly says that the Lord, the living One, the all-inclusive One, the central One, the universal One, is today subjectively in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether we know it or not, this matter is clearly revealed in the Word.</S>
