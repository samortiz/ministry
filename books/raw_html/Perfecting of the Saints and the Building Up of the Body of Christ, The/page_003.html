 <h2 class="head1">CHRIST DESCENDING<br />
INTO THE LOWER PARTS OF THE EARTH<br />
AND ASCENDING FAR ABOVE THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>This portion first shows us the ascended Head. &ldquo;Wherefore He says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men. (Now this, He ascended, what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is the same who also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things)&rdquo; (Eph. 4:8-10). Christ is the One who ascended to the height. The fact that He has ascended to the height proves that He had descended to a low place. He was originally on the throne in heaven. In His becoming flesh, He came down from heaven to earth and was born in a manger in Bethlehem, a small, earthly town.</p>
<p>He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He went to the cross and died there. After this He went down to Hades, which is the &ldquo;lower parts of the earth&rdquo; mentioned in verse 9. From there, He resurrected from the dead and came out of Hades and the grave, ascending to the earth. After forty days, He ascended from the earth before the eyes of the disciples far above all the heavens (Acts 1:9). The descending of the Lord was from heaven to the earth, then from the earth to Hades. His ascending was from Hades to the earth, then from the earth to the height above all the heavens. This journey of His was His work. In this work He first became flesh to be a man. The unlimited, boundless God who transcends time and space became a man limited in time and space, restricted in all respects. When He was in Judea He could not be in Galilee, and when He was in Galilee He could not be in Jerusalem. He was restricted by time and space for thirty-three and a half years. This was not a short period of time. Hence, His becoming flesh to be a man was a great matter.</p>
<p>Neither was it a small thing for Him to live on earth for such a long time. While He was on earth, the earth was in confusion. There was almost nothing that could afford Him joy. Even His closest disciple denied Him when He was about to go to the cross. He bore all this. It was not a simple thing for Him to bear this for thirty-three and a half years. Then He went through a process to go to the cross. He passed through man&rsquo;s arrest, interrogations, and examinations. He was condemned unrighteously and unfairly by the blind religion in conjunction with the dark politics. He bore His own cross for part of the way from the city of Jerusalem to Golgotha and was crucified there. He remained on the cross for six hours, accomplishing the work of the cross, and entered into the grave and descended into Hades. After three days, He came out of Hades and the grave and was resurrected. In His resurrection He remained on earth for forty more days before ascending to the heavens.</p>
<p>Throughout this process He accomplished many works. First, He brought God into man in a real way. Second, He lived in man to pass through all the sufferings of human life. Third, He went to the cross to accomplish the all-inclusive death. On the negative side, He solved the problem of our sin (John 1:29; 1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:26, 28; 1 Cor. 15:3), dealt with the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3), crucified the old man on the cross (Rom. 6:6), destroyed Satan (Heb. 2:14) together with his world (John 12:31), terminated the old creation, and abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances which divided man (Eph. 2:14-16). On the positive side, He released the glorious, divine, unlimited, and eternal life. Fourth, in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is everywhere. He is so available that He is even in our mouth and in our spirit. When you call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; you will have a certain feeling within. If you call on any famous men in history, you will not have such a feeling. This is because they are all dead. Plato, Socrates, Confucius, Mencius, Laotze, etc., all died. Even if you call their names, there will be no response. But once you call on the Lord Jesus, something will start happening within you. You will have a certain feeling. This is because this Jesus has resurrected from the dead and has become the life-giving Spirit. Now He is in us as life. This was all accomplished through His becoming flesh, through His passing through human living, and through His resurrecting from the dead.</p>
